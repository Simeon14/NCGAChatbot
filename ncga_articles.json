    "title": "Corn Ranks Number One in Pet Food Ingredients",
    "content": "Corn has officially claimed the top spot as the most-used plant-based ingredient in U.S. pet food, according to a recent report released by the Institute for Feed Education and Research (IFEEDER). The 2024 Pet Food Ingredient Analysis, which was released in March, underscores corn’s critical role in one of agriculture’s most dynamic markets. The independent study, which National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) helped support, analyzed more than 600 ingredients used in commercial dog and cat food. Among them, corn ranked as the No. 1 plant-based ingredient, valued for its versatility, digestibility and nutrient density. Why Corn Matters in Pet Food Corn isn’t just filler. It’s a functional, high-quality ingredient with clear benefits for pets, including: Easily digestible carbohydrates – provide energy for active dogs and cats Essential amino acids – support muscle development and maintenance Natural fiber – promotes healthy digestion Rich in antioxidants like vitamin E and lutein – support overall system health Protein and texture – corn gluten meal and bran provide concentrated protein and contribute to stool quality This nutritional profile makes corn a trusted choice for pet food formulators aiming to deliver complete and balanced diets. By the Numbers $51.7 billion in U.S. pet food sales (2024); 9.8 million tons of pet food produced States like Missouri, Iowa and Kansas saw over $1 billion each in ingredient purchases Corn is the leading ingredient by value in the Farm of Mill-Based products category at $334 million; corn protein meal follows at $291 million $13.2 billion spent on farm-grown ingredients A Growing Opportunity for Corn Growers With sustainability in focus, corn’s ability to contribute both primary ingredients and valuable co-products like corn gluten meal aligns with consumer and industry demand for more environmentally responsible options. NCGA’s support of this research reinforces corn’s broad market relevance beyond feed and fuel. As the pet food sector continues to grow, corn farmers are well-positioned to meet the need for nutritious, high-performance ingredients. More About the Study IFEEDER’s independent study was conducted in partnership with the Pet Food Institute, American Feed Industry Association (AFIA) and the North American Renderers Association’s research arm called the Fats and Proteins Research Foundation.

In response to the announcement, Illinois farmer and National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) President Kenneth Hartman Jr. made the following statement: “We appreciate the work that the administration has dedicated to brokering a deal with Japan, worth $2.7 billion, and we welcome today’s announcement. Japan is the second-largest market for U.S. corn exports, and we support any effort to expand the purchase of corn and corn products, like ethanol. U.S. corn growers produce an abundant crop year in and year out, and NCGA has long advocated for increased access to foreign markets, which will support American farmers and rural economies.”",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and Ag Data Transparent announced today a new partnership to bring clarity to farmers interested in carbon market contracts. “The rapid expansion of carbon programs and solution providers in agriculture presents immense opportunities - but also significant risks,” said Sean Arians, NCGA vice president, Sustainable Production and Value Chain Engagement. “As new programs and players enter the space, farmers are left with limited information, unclear standards, and inconsistent program guidelines, making it difficult to evaluate opportunities and confidently participate.” Without a neutral, transparent informational foundation, farmers risk unforeseen obligations and uncertain returns. Recognizing this urgent need, NCGA is launching this initiative in partnership with ADT while also working to secure additional funding from industry organizations and businesses. The first phase of this project will launch in Fall 2025. In alignment with ADT’s mission, this project aims to bring the same level of transparency, simplicity and trust to carbon initiatives in ag that ADT has successfully delivered in the agricultural data sector. “By building on ADT’s trusted brand and established framework, this new carbon-focused initiative will help farmers make informed decisions and navigate both existing and emerging carbon programs with confidence,” said Todd Janzen, partner with Janzen Schroeder Ag Law and ADT administrator. Agricultural stakeholders who support transparency in the carbon marketplace are encouraged to participate and contribute. Wide industry engagement will improve the initiative’s ability to provide a transparent certification and propel the emerging market while limiting risks for farmers.

    "title": "Corn Growers Applaud Chief Agricultural Negotiator Pick",
    "content": "The leadership of the National Corn Growers Association today applauded the nomination of Dr. Julie Callahan as chief agricultural negotiator at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The nomination comes about a week after NCGA sent a letter, signed by 42 agricultural organizations, to President Trump encouraging him to move quickly on nominating someone for the role. “Corn grower leaders have been very vocal in recent weeks about the need to fill this important position, as the chief ag negotiator plays a critical role in prioritizing agriculture issues in ongoing trade negotiations,” said Illinois corn grower and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “We are thrilled to see the president listened and chose someone of this caliber to represent the interests of America’s farmers. It was a pleasure to congratulate Dr. Callahan in person today during our meeting at the White House.” The chief agricultural negotiator is responsible for leading and coordinating agricultural trade negotiations and developing agricultural trade policy. The role has historically been critical to the agricultural sector and has only increased in importance as NCGA advocates for more trade deals with market access. Callahan has close to 20 years of working on international issues and trade at a variety of agencies, including USTR, the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Her most recent experience includes almost nine years serving as assistant U.S. trade representative for agricultural affairs and commodity policy.",

    "title": "Corn Grower Leaders Call on Trump to Intervene with MAHA Commission",
    "content": "The president of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and farmer leaders from 19 state-based corn grower groups sent a letter to President Trump today asking him to intervene as the Make America Healthy Again Commission prepares to release policy recommendations that question the safety of pesticides that have been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. “Our alarm stems from the initial assessment, released in May, which raised pesticide safety questions that have already been answered repeatedly over the decades by research and regulatory agencies,” the letter said. “If such language is included in the policy recommendations, it could significantly hamper the work of America’s farmers and raise prices on consumers without providing any additional layer of safety for the American public.” The letter is notable because of the president’s popularity among farmers and rural Americans and comes as corn growers express concerns about the aggregate effects of tariffs, low corn prices and rising input costs. A loss of critical production tools would be another blow at an already difficult time. Today’s letter zeroed in on the specific effect the recommendations could have on growers. “If the pesticides in the original report were to disappear completely, crop yields could decrease by more than 70% due to pests, weeds and disease,” the grower leaders noted. The EPA is exacting in its review process of pesticides, the letter explained. “Every pesticide approved for use must submit dozens, if not hundreds, of test results for EPA review and consideration, including tests examining potential effects on child development, dietary exposure, and long-term toxicity,” the letter noted. “The EPA’s reviews, required by law, are repeated at least every 15 years, or sooner if new data become available.” The corn grower leaders said they were happy administration members have met with them recently but also said more needs to be done. “While we appreciate that members of your administration have met with agricultural groups and leaders in recent weeks, our farmers remain deeply troubled,” the signatories noted. “The initial assessment and a long list of unfounded statements that key architects of the MAHA report have repeated, are prime fodder for trial attorneys seeking to profit and protectionist trading partners who are determined to erect barriers to American agricultural products.” The administration is expected to release the strategy document in August. The letter is the latest in a series of actions by the nation’s corn growers to express their concerns about MAHA’s efforts. ​ Read Letter​​​​​​",

    "content": "A letter with signatures from 42 agricultural associations, led by the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), was sent to President Trump today urging him to expeditiously nominate a chief agricultural negotiator in the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The group said the nomination is critical to prioritizing the needs of American agriculture amidst the ongoing reciprocal trade negotiations. “The chief agricultural negotiator is an asset to farmers and ranchers across the United States as well as within the federal government,” the letter said. “Their voice ensures that agriculture issues are prioritized as negotiations are ongoing and become more complicated.” The role is responsible for conducting and overseeing international negotiations related to trade of agricultural products. The role is political, and each incoming administration is responsible for nominating someone to serve in the position. The signatories applauded the president for addressing international trade and promoting U.S. trade interests. “We are also encouraged by your administration’s willingness to address unfair trade practices that are distorting markets and creating supply chain vulnerabilities in the U.S. food system,” the letter noted. “To ensure that meaningful progress is made, we seek the nomination and confirmation of a chief agricultural negotiator to prioritize agriculture issues at the negotiating table and to secure wins for rural America.” The letter comes as farmers and ranchers are facing challenging economic conditions with low prices, high input costs, increased global competition and languishing markets. Farmers and ranchers heavily rely on exports to be successful, and the momentum generated by the ongoing reciprocal trade negotiations is promising. Read Letter",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) applauded pieces of the Budget Reconciliation bill, which passed the U.S. Senate today. “NCGA has worked closely with members of Congress as they drafted and voted on this legislation,” said Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “We are particularly pleased to see the permanent extension of certain tax provisions, which will provide more certainty to corn farmers around the country as they plan for the future of their businesses.” The bill contains many of NCGA’s federal tax priorities, including: Permanently extending key provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, including the expanded estate and gift tax exemptions, the qualified business income deduction and 100% bonus depreciation. Extending and modifying the clean fuel production tax credit, referred to as 45Z. The tax credit can help the biofuels industry make inroads into the aviation sector and attract investment into opening new markets for U.S. corn. One positive inclusion in the Senate’s 45Z language is its allowance of transferability of the credit. However, the Senate language reduces the value of the credit from $1.75 to $1.00 and shortens the lifetime of the credit from 2031 to 2029, actions that could injure the new market’s growth potential. The bill also contains several of NCGA’s longstanding farm bill priorities, including: Addressing the affordability of federal crop insurance coverage for producers, including support for beginning farmers and ranchers. Doubling mandatory funding for trade promotion programs, which will develop new markets and promote U.S. goods, helping to boost U.S. agricultural exports. Strengthening the producer safety net by investing in modifications to the Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage commodity programs that are more responsive to the current economic environment. “While we would prefer to advance major agricultural legislation through a comprehensive farm bill, we are appreciative of the Senate leadership for getting a bill with many of our tax and farm bill priorities passed,” said Hartman. NCGA has also advocated for policies to ensure that all base acres and payments better reflect growers’ recent planting history and is disappointed that meaningful reforms to existing base acres was not included in the bill.",

    "content": "With connection and collaboration at the heart of its mission, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) hosted its fifth annual Women and Mentors Retreat on June 25 and 26 in Chicago, Illinois. The Women and Mentors retreat is designed to create a diverse network of individuals who wish to empower women in agriculture. Throughout the conference, participants learned to “Quiet their Inner Critic” with help from author, Randi Braun, explored their strengths through the CliftonStrengths Assessment, learned ways to embrace authenticity with Felecia Pryor, Chief People Officer of John Deere, and worked through project development ideas in a team setting. Sponsor representatives Kianna Wilson from FMC and Kate Greif from BASF also shared impactful sessions to add to the variety of topics covered at the conference. Hearing from accomplished leaders like Jennifer Houston, Lori Stevermer and Verity Ulibarri in a panel led by our own NCGA Chief Economist, Krista Swanson, made for an engaging and rewarding retreat experience. Attendee Hailey Gilbert from Michigan was looking for an opportunity to network and grow when the Women and Mentors Retreat was introduced to her by a past employer. Gilbert walked away from the conference feeling refreshed and encouraged. “All the speakers were really strong examples of women in agriculture, so I’m taking away tangible leadership skills and interpersonal skills,” said Gilbert. After two days of connection, growth and energy, cohorts were created to extend the impact of the retreat beyond its scheduled time. Mentorship groups are comprised of farmers, industry professionals, sponsor representatives, male allies and anyone who shares in the mission of acknowledging the vital role women play in the agriculture industry. “We feel it’s very important to elevate the role of women in agriculture, so that they can continue to grow as leaders and lead future customer organizations,” said Jarah Hauger, a representative of an event sponsor, John Deere. NCGA would like to thank all of our sponsors for making the Women and Mentors Retreat possible for the fifth year in a row: Syngenta, FMC, Bayer, John Deere and BASF.",

    "title": "New Study Shows Corn Farming is a Major Engine for U.S. Economy",
    "content": "The United States is the world’s largest producer and exporter of corn, and corn farmers are bolstering the U.S. economy and building strong communities, according to a new study released by the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA). Corn grower leaders say they could make an even bigger contribution to the U.S. economy through increased sales of ethanol and the cultivation of new foreign markets. The study, entitled The Economic Value of Corn Farming in the United States for 2024, noted the contribution of corn farming and its upstream linkages extended across 506 different industry sectors in all 50 states, generating an estimated $123 billion in total economic output in 2024. The report also shows that corn farming supported over 440,000 jobs and provided $29 billion in wages, strengthening communities in rural America and across the entire nation. “These findings show that the corn industry is an essential contributor to the nation’s agricultural and economic value chains,” said NCGA Chief Economist Krista Swanson. “The study demonstrates the positive ripple effect of corn production, vital to a healthy U.S. economy.” NCGA said that given the chance, corn growers could contribute even more to the U.S. economy. “Corn growers and farmers across the country are clearly helping to propel the U.S. economy,” said Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “Corn farming’s economic value could be even greater if corn growers were able to fully contribute to the domestic fuel supply via increased ethanol blends and access to additional export markets.” Corn grower leaders have been advocating for Congress to pass legislation that would allow for the nationwide, year-round sale of fuel with a 15% ethanol blend. They have also worked to make an aviation fuel tax credit accessible so that ethanol and other biofuels could be used in the aviation sector. And NCGA has called on the administration and Congress to aggressively pursue new and expanded foreign markets for American corn exporters. NCGA and state corn grower groups will visit Capitol Hill officers in early July to continue their advocacy efforts on these key priorities. READ THE STUDY",

    "title": "NCGA Reacts to Senate 45Z Proposal",
    "content": "As Congress continues conversations on the future of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) cautioned lawmakers against recent changes proposed in the Senate. “Our champions on Capitol Hill have dedicated an immense amount of time and attention to this complex issue,” said Kenneth Hartman Jr., Illinois farmer and NCGA President. “We hope that effort results in policy that works for American farmers. However, the proposed changes in the Senate reconciliation language cause some concern for corn growers.” The Senate language grants fuels derived from foreign feedstocks the ability to claim 80 percent of the tax credit. NCGA prefers the approach the House took in its One Big Beautiful Bill Act, limiting access to the incentive for feedstocks produced or grown outside of North America. The Senate language also reduces the value of the synthetic aviation fuel (SAF) credit from $1.75 to $1.00, an action that could injure the new market’s growth potential which corn growers feel could have a substantial impact on their profitability for years to come. One bright spot in the Senate’s 45Z language is its allowance of transferability of the credit. “We look forward to working with members of Congress to improve this legislation in a way that benefits the nation’s corn growers and the biofuel industry,” said Hartman. To strengthen 45Z, NCGA supports inclusion of a “book and claim” accounting system for implementation of the credit, the expansion of eligible conservation practices, a reduction in the Carbon Intensity (CI) threshold for SAF to 30% and transferability for the full life of the credit.",

    "content": "The president of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) released a statement today regarding the budget reconciliation legislation proposed by the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Corn growers were able to secure improvements compared to earlier versions of the legislation. “We are pleased to see that Chairman Boozman (R-Ark.) retained increased investment in agricultural trade promotion programs and made additional improvements to the commodity programs, including removing the proposed corn price floor for the Price Loss Coverage program,” said NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “Though several crucial steps remain in the Senate’s process for completing budget reconciliation, and this is not the process that we would have chosen, we want to recognize the Sente Agriculture Committee leadership for its response to corn growers’ concerns.” The legislation includes funding for several programs traditionally included in the Farm Bill. While the Senate takes steps forward, Harman noted there is still room for improvement, particularly when it comes to updating existing base acres, which determines eligibility for farm programs. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is being shepherded through Congress under the budget reconciliation process, which allows Congress to expedite spending and tax legislation. NCGA is eager to review the tax portion of the legislation, which is expected soon from the Senate Finance Committee. Additional procedural steps remain ahead, including reviews by the Senate parliamentarian, consideration from the Senate Budget Committee, and then consideration of the full U.S. Senate.",

    "title": "New Report: MAHA Efforts on Pesticides Could Cost Farmers",
    "content": "In response to the recent release of the Making America Healthy Again report, which raised unfounded questions about the safety of pesticides, the National Corn Growers Association has released a report that speaks to the economic impact of widely used technologies, like atrazine and glyphosate. “U.S. farmers consistently raise abundant crops that provide consumers reliable, low-cost access to food,” said NCGA Chief Economist and Illinois farmer, Krista Swanson, who authored the report. “One of the central tenets to producing crops is the control of pests that, when left unchecked, can reduce corn yields by up to 70%. Pesticides are one tool that farmers use to control pests, the safety and efficacy of which have been repeatedly tested and documented for decades.” Farmers would face at least a 60% increase in cost if they were to switch from glyphosate and atrazine to alternative herbicides, according to the report. Similarly, a recent North Carolina State Extension analysis looking at the potential short-term economic impact of losing glyphosate in North Carolina estimated a 73% increase in costs for corn. Farmers have said without pesticides, they have limited options for addressing weed and pesticide control. That assertion was echoed by the NCGA report. “Without access to effective and affordable herbicides, farmers could turn to other options to control weeds, though all present difficult trade-offs,” the report notes. “Given current labor wage rates and challenges in finding farm labor, manual control is likely too costly and inaccessible to be realistic on most corn acres.” Many experts have said growers could increasingly turn to tillage as an alternative, but such a move would lead to greater soil erosion and compaction, contrary to sustainable farm practices favoring less tillage. And, according to the NCGA report, it could take up to three or four tillage passes per acre to effectively control weeds, costing about $15 to $30 per acre, per pass, and requiring increased use of fuel A 2023 study by the Directions Group, shows glyphosate has enabled conservation practices that result in a slew of environmental gains, including: 22% reduction in sediment loss, 19% reduction in water use for irrigation, 16% reduction in soil erosion from wind, 13% reduction in soil erosion from water, 1.2 million tons fewer carbon emissions from farm machinery, and 32.5 million additional tons of carbon equivalents captured by farmland soil. NCGA and other ag groups have emphasized in recent weeks that glyphosate and atrazine are time-tested products that have been in use for more than half a century. Glyphosate has been registered as a pesticide in the United States since 1974 and atrazine has been registered as a pesticide since 1958. Since then, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other regulatory agencies around the world, has reviewed and reassessed each product’s safety and use multiple times. The report ends with a warning that removing these technologies could be disruptive. “Without continued access to pesticides that protect against devastating pests, U.S. farms and ranches would quickly become economically unsustainable, jeopardizing U.S. farmers’ ability to provide affordable food and other agricultural products to consumers,” the report said. “Preserving access to these technologies and encouraging further advancement is essential to maintaining both a robust, quality supply of goods for U.S. consumers and competitiveness for U.S. agriculture globally.” Read the Report",

    "title": "EP. 54 - Opening New Markets for Corn in India, Vietnam and Beyond",
    "content": "New trade deals could be the balm growers need amid uncertain markets. Growers are hoping the recent rollout of a new U.S. trade deal with the United Kingdom is a sign of things to come. The agreement is the first trade pact with a new trading partner since 2012. And amid tariff uncertainty and unsettled markets, the presidential administration is signaling its desire to make trade deals with new countries a top priority. In particular, discussions are ongoing to open up new markets for corn in India and Vietnam, representing a potentially huge boost for the American corn industry. So in this episode of the Cobcast, we’re talking to two top experts on international trade: Andrew Brandt, the Director of Trade Policy at the U.S. Grains Council; and Nancy Martinez, the Director of Public Policy, Trade and Biotechnology at the National Corn Growers Association. Together, we’ll answer many of the distinct trade questions on growers’ minds at this moment, like what are some other possible destinations for corn exports? What could potential deals look like with these new countries? And what does it all mean for folks who are just getting a crop in the ground? Direct Share Link: https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ncga?selected=PDM3748659843 Transcript Andrew Brandt India is a very important market to start having hopefully more and more exports over there from our surplus. I can’t overestimate how important that could be to the ag market. Nancy Martinez Vietnam’s corn import demand is estimated to be nearly 12 million metric tons. Even partially meeting that demand could be a huge opportunity for American corn growers. Dusty Weis Hello and welcome to the Cobcast: Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you're following this show on your favorite podcast app and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association Newsletter at NCGA.com. I'm Dusty Weis, and today we're going to be talking about trade because without someone to buy our crops, we are really just digging in the dirt here as growers. But trade is a topic that has been on everyone's mind since President Trump was sworn into office earlier this year. Certainly, tariffs have played a large part in that, but today we are going to be talking about a slightly different, however somewhat related topic. And that is the fact that the Trump administration is working hard to open new markets to US corn exports. As a for instance, the recent rollout of a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom was a nice piece of good news in the American countryside, where farmers have been frustrated by the fact that the United States has not brokered a trade agreement with a new country since, get this, the year 2012. I'm pretty sure that was pre-Harlem Shake. Of course, there have been updated trade agreements like USMCA signed in recent years, but incredibly, the US has not inked a formal deal with the new country since 2012. So what are some of the possible destinations for corn exports? What could potential deals look like with these new countries? And what does it all mean for those of us who are just getting a crop in the ground right now? Well, we are joined today by two experts who work on this issue. Nancy Martinez is the Director of Public Policy, Trade and Biotechnology at the National Corn Growers Association, and Andrew Brandt is the Director of Trade Policy at the US Grains Council. Nancy and Andrew, welcome back to the Cobcast. Nancy Martinez Thanks for having us. Andrew Brandt Yeah, good to be back, Dusty, I'm proud to be back. That means I didn't mess up the first time. Dusty Weis Repeat guests, that's what you want. That kind of stability is what we're all after in the year 2025 here, certainly. When we all got together about a year ago, we were talking about the export of GM corn to Mexico and the big dispute over that. Now it suffices to say that a lot about the world of international trade has changed over the last year. So, Nancy, can you kick us off by telling us a little bit about the state of play as the Trump administration is making these inroads with other countries as trading partners? Nancy Martinez Yes, absolutely. And there's been a flurry of activity ever since inauguration day back on January 20th. And as you mentioned before, it's been a long time since the US has brokered one of these formal free trade agreements with a new country. But this new administration is showing a real appetite to get in the weeds and do some hard work in negotiating with countries. This is obviously spurred by the recent tariff announcement, and the Trump administration is claiming that they have over 20 countries who've made offers and are currently negotiating with all of these countries on a bilateral basis. The Trump administration prefers to do these trade discussions, negotiations, whatever you want to call them on a bilateral basis. So just the US and one other country. The Trump administration wants to do this all with an executive authority, so not involve Congress. There's obviously pros and cons to that strategy, but it obviously gives the Trump administration some latitude to really progress things and move at a rapid pace on a bilateral basis. So we're encouraged by this activity. Obviously, bilateral trade agreements or trade deals can do a lot of good for the corn industry. The recent news with the United Kingdom is a really good step in the right direction, especially for ethanol exports. So we're hoping more to come with the UK and all these other countries. Dusty Weis Nancy, you mentioned some of the pros and cons of having these trade deals take place under executive authority. I was wondering if there are also pros and cons of having these deals be bilateral, as you mentioned, as opposed to in the case of USMCA, a trilateral agreement. Do these sorts of deals go faster when there's only two parties at the negotiating table? Nancy Martinez Absolutely. So when there's only the US and one other country, you don't have influences from another party that could potentially hold up the agreement. So it makes things come together at a more rapid pace. But obviously, you know, it could also lead to some duplicative nature as well. So if you do a more multilateral approach, you can kind of tackle some issues on a broader basis. But that obviously takes a lot more time. Dusty Weis So, Andrew, when we're talking about the new markets that the Trump administration is exploring, which countries are we talking about? Andrew Brandt Several. Well, Nancy mentioned there's 20 countries negotiating but there's 60 total countries caught up in the higher reciprocal tariff here that's kind of brought the countries to the table. Two that kind of float to the top or that catch our eyes as we're looking at export markets are certainly India and then Vietnam. Vietnam, we do have a little bit of a footprint in, but India would be the new Belle at the ball, they might say. You know, over a billion people, very large economy, growing middle class. So that is the country with the most probably to gain. And also as far as, you know, kind of the conversations around these negotiations, perhaps the country that the Trump administration has kind of signaled they are going for the biggest deal with. Negotiations are still in their infancy, but a lot of people are very hopeful with regard to a new, as Nancy correctly said, executive trade agreement with India. Dusty Weis So when we talk about doing a trade agreement, Vietnam and India are both countries that the US does have some degree of trade with. So, Nancy, when we're talking about brokering these deals then, what specifically are we talking about? Is this about lowering tariffs, breaking down other trade barriers? And more specifically, why aren't these places buying US corn right now? Nancy Martinez So for India, it's much more than just the tariff that has prevented access for corn growers. They have these really draconian restrictions on biotechnology, which prevents access for corn into that market. In the US, over 94% of the corn grown is genetically modified in some way, and that helps the corn to be more resilient to fight off pests. So all these advantages that farmers need. So because of India's restrictions on biotech, corn can't be imported at all. So there's a real opportunity we see for DDGs, yellow corn, and also ethanol into India. Right now we are able to import ethanol into India, but only for industrial use, not for fuel use. So we're really looking for the Trump administration to look beyond tariffs and tackle some of these other barriers, which we know that they are open to. But it will be, you know, a lot of work to make sure that the Indian regulators understand what the science that we use is in order to make the determination of approval in the US. Just to talk a little bit about India's own domestic industries, the corn that we would potentially be importing into India would not disrupt their domestic industries. They recently expanded ethanol production capacity, so they don't produce enough corn to meet the needs of their own ethanol production. So our corn that we would potentially be able to import into India would help them meet their own production needs without disrupting those farmers in India. Dusty Weis It's kind of wild that we're coming right back, you know, a year ago we had this conversation about the USMCA and GM corn then, and here we are back on this GMO thing again. This was the issue at the heart of that trade dispute with Mexico. The fact that they didn't understand or chose to ignore the fact that GMO corn is perfectly safe, and they wanted to restrict its import. Now NCGA won that trade dispute case in resounding fashion. We're talking about a score board of like 38 to 0 at the end of the fourth quarter. A direct quote from the dispute settlement panel was, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong here, that Mexico's measures were, “not based on science.” To what degree is that case easing the concerns of other potential trading partners in helping to open up these new markets for US corn? Nancy Martinez So I think in the Mexico case, Mexico was accepting GM corn without a problem and then put this regulation on the books. So there was definitely a backtracking. With the Indian market, they have not allowed biotech corn in before. They do have a biotech approved product that they grow in India, cotton, but they have never let in other commodities. So I think we're a bit starting from the beginning in India. But because of India's changing domestic industries, you know, with the ethanol production, with their very large dairy herd, the largest in the world, the dynamics are so that they actually need to figure out a way to address the needs of their own economy. And American corn growers are very poised to help them fill that. Dusty Weis Certainly a lot of economic benefits for India, but also benefits for our growers right here at home of entering into these new agreements with these countries. What would be the economic benefit for the United States, starting with India, for example, Andrew? Andrew Brandt Well, Nancy just did a good job showcasing some of the various products we could start shipping them. Economic estimations, you know, there's always room for error there, but one of the ones we've seen is somewhere around $750 million in the first year if we can get India opened up. And certainly if we could knock down more of the barriers like the GM corn barrier, that number could go up. They've got 1.3 billion people, you know, not often talked about, but a lot of the world population estimates put India as now the largest country in the world and you know still growing. So there are a lot of mouths to feed there if they're going to transition their fuel system to E30. That's a lot of ethanol to clean up their air. So the opportunity here is very large. It would be a good shot in the first year. But the long term opportunity there as we look towards the end of this decade is equally important, especially when you consider the growing trend line yield here in the US. So India is a very important market. The numbers in the near-term expectation numbers are very, very good. But it's also just getting it opened up, building those relationships to start having hopefully more and more exports over there from our surplus. Can't underestimate how important that can be to the ag market here in the US. Dusty Weis No, certainly. Yeah, absolutely. A huge potential benefit there. There's definitely not 1.3 billion people in Vietnam. But what about the potential economic impact from opening up a deal there, Nancy? Nancy Martinez Yeah, absolutely. So Vietnam's corn import demand is estimated to be nearly 12 million metric tons for market year, 25/26. So that is a very, very sizable amount. Even partially meeting that demand could be a huge opportunity for American corn growers. Vietnam is the largest consumer of yellow corn within that Southeast Asia region on the import side. So because they import nearly all of that from Brazil, there's no reason why the US can't step up and fill a portion of that demand. Vietnam actually did reduce their tariff on ethanol, dropping that from 10% to 5%. So there's also an opportunity there. Dusty Weis I mean, from where we're sitting right now, obviously we want to export more corn, but both of these seem like pretty big no-brainers. What are some potential hurdles that we might have to overcome to make this happen? Andrew Brandt I mean, there's always any number of hurdles. You can see a lot of these hurdles we get to, you know, there's just the tariff barriers we talked about, then the non-tariff barriers. But there's also the ongoing business relationship. They've been dealing with Brazil. They've kind of become accustomed to it. It's kind of I would describe it in a very loose way, kind of like you're used to going to your gas station in your hometown, and that's just the one that works for you. So a new one comes along. What kind of incentive do they have to throw you to get you to change? So there's relationships there. But I do think they're both growing economies. There certainly is an opportunity. We actually have a little bit of different corn than Brazil. Brazil has a very hard, I learned this since coming to the Council, I didn't know there were two types of corn in the world. I thought it was just all No. 2 yellow corn. But Brazil has what's known as flint corn, which is actually like more of a round kernel that is very, very hard on the outside. It’s pretty, but ours actually mills a little better. We have a higher starch content, which we would argue is what they're really buying the corn for. So we think we are very, very competitive with our product to go into those markets, whether it be for feed or ethanol, what have you. So it's a lot tariffs, it’s some like a biotech ban is obviously a huge hurdle. But then there's also kind of the relationships that you have to go in and build and you have to be a reliable supplier. So there are challenges like that, but certainly there's nothing that is insurmountable. We just want the chance to kind of, on the policy side, get the playing field leveled. So then our grain companies can go in there and do what they do. Dusty Weis Yeah. It sounds like aside from the whole GMO thing, the biggest barrier that we face is inertia, yeah? Andrew Brandt Yeah, I think just getting the door open for us so we can go and compete. Nancy Martinez And I would also add, you know, countries are trying to diversify their own supply chain. So they're not just reliant on one sole supplier. So the US can definitely be part of that overall equation and help countries kind of spread their risk around. Dusty Weis So Nancy, obviously this is an issue of great interest to the National Corn Growers Association. So what are you all doing at NCGA headquarters and out in DC to help ensure that these agreements happen, to get them over the finish line? Nancy Martinez Yeah, absolutely. We are closely working with the Trump administration, with USTR Ambassador Jamieson Greer, with Secretary Rollins over at USDA. We are doing public efforts, we recently just did a press conference talking about the benefits of India. And we also have, you know, our chief economist and our board president talking about a lot of these opportunities and kind of soliciting various feedback about how we can better obtain market access. Obviously, we just want our issues to be top of mind for administration officials when they are going in with a variety of different countries, hundreds of thousands of requests from industries, manufacturers, people all across the United States. We just want them to have corn top of mind. Dusty Weis Andrew, you did a really good job laying out sort of the institutional inertia that we face in getting this deal done and how it's really important to build relationships and to be seen as a reliable trading partner and all of these things that really just take time and trust. So my next question feels kind of dumb, but how quick can we get this done? Can we talk about timing a little bit? How soon could we see a deal happen? Andrew Brandt Great question. I think there's a lot of people around DC debating this. So if we look at it like a more traditional trade agreement, those usually take years and or a decade, like in the case of TPP. The Trump administration, and I can't stress this enough, is using the exact opposite approach of that. They're going very fast. So going back to the launch of the reciprocal tariffs in April, then the pausing, there's a 90 day negotiating window with the 60 countries that these 20 countries who have already put offers on the table. This 90 day window wraps up, I believe, just after the 4th of July, I believe July 6 or 7. So that is the goal of the Trump administration to get these executive trade agreements wrapped up by, which is I dare say, the most aggressive negotiating schedule in the history of worldwide trade negotiations. It's a very aggressive pace. Will they all be done? We will wait and see. We know that they've already had 20 offers on the table, so they're working through details. And then India could potentially take a little longer. But who knows. Maybe it'll move fast. I mean the Trump administration, you know, I've been in DC a while now. And typically DC is seen as a slow policy town. That is not the case right now. Things are moving very fast. So we will see where we end up. Check back in after the 4th of July, I guess. Dusty Weis Certainly I know a lot of growers who would love to see something get done this summer. Yet even so, Nancy, what can we do to help get this thing over the finish line to help with this process? Nancy Martinez Yeah so, anybody interested in either learning more or trying to figure out how to help us participate in all these market access outreach efforts, go to our website, www.NCGA.com. You can click on the “News” section to read more about what we're doing, and then go to the Action Center to sign up for any alerts. So this will help anybody who's interested to participate in outreach on this, but also other important issues affecting corn growers. Dusty Weis Certainly the voice of the grower, always a strong one, always carries a lot of weight in DC. And if there's anything that we can do to contribute to helping get this thing moving, I think it's a worthwhile endeavor. Andrew, you said a while back a word that I've heard a lot lately. In fact, I'd put it as a strong frontrunner for word of the year for 2025. And that's the word “uncertainty.” But it is kind of that time of year right now when growers wish things were a little bit more certain. They're getting their fields planted, maybe they're looking at the contracts on offer and trying to decide, is this the best price that I can get this year? So for growers who have been frustrated by the price of corn, what do they need to know about what the next few months and the year ahead might hold? Andrew Brandt Thanks for the easy question. I think as you look at, you know, farmers are hopeful people. We go out and plant every year. I grew up on a farm in Missouri. The planted acres stay pretty similar, even though there are years where you go out there and there's a lot of uncertainty with, you know, what the price is and you're hoping for things to swing by harvest, even though there's typically a harvest low. And then, you know, you get into the winter months and store your grain and then sell it. I think the president has said it himself, you got to be patient. We hope this will open up new market opportunities. But this is kind of a new reconfiguring of the globalized world a lot of us have known the last couple decades. So I think farmers should be hopeful, take opportunities. We certainly can say the Trump administration is working very hard to open up new opportunities. Until we get the details of that, I don't want to over promise here, but I do think there's a lot of effort to push trade in the right direction for farmers who are out there planting today. So they’re just going to have to do what they always do, which is remain hopeful and go grow a good crop, take advantage of market rallies if they and when they come. And we'll see where the policy stuff shakes out. Because when you're on your tractor, you do feel kind of detached, borrowing a bunch of money or, you know, risking a lot of money to put this crop in. And I sure hope the market's there by harvest time next year. This is my livelihood. So it is a stressful thing to do. We're just gonna have to wait, be patient and hope these things come through. And I think based on the effort I'm seeing, if things don't go right, it's not going to be because of a lack of effort. Dusty Weis Nancy, I'm going to give you the last word on this. Anything to add there? Nancy Martinez Well, I think Andrew summed it up great. I think we are, yes, in a period where it's difficult to predict what's going to happen with all these markets, with all of these countries coming to the table. I think what hasn't changed, though, is the quality and the stability of the American farmer and the crops that we produce right on the corn side. And I think that's what we definitely have in our advantage. When farmers are planting right now, yes, we've got a period before harvest, but you can definitely rely on your folks at NCGA, at Grains Council to do the heavy work and relaying concerns to the administration and positive feedback as well. So that's our job, and we'll continue to do that. Dusty Weis Certainly another thing that hasn't changed is growers still have folks like you two working on their behalf in DC and around the world trying to get these deals done as well. They can take comfort knowing that hopefully we're going to get this thing over the finish line. Hopefully we'll have some new markets opened up and we really appreciate the two of you taking time to catch us up on all of this and getting us up to speed.

We are deeply troubled that claims of this magnitude are being made without any scientific basis or regard for a long history of EPA expert evaluations of these products. “Decades of extensive research and testing show that pesticides, including atrazine and glyphosate, can be applied safely for their intended uses. If the administration’s goal is to bring more efficiency to government, then why is the secretary of Health and Human Services duplicating efforts by raising questions about pesticides that have been answered repeatedly through research and reviews by federal regulatory bodies? “We call on the administration to respect the existing body of science on pesticides and, moving forward, to include America’s farmers in discussion as this process evolves.”",

    "content": "The Make America Healthy Again Commission is expected to soon release a report that will have significant bearing on America’s farmers, producers and ranchers, and the public’s trust in our food system. In anticipation, the American Soybean Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, International Fresh Produce Association and, in turn, the farmers these groups represent, are imploring the administration to consider the consequences of this MAHA Commission report before it is finalized. “American agriculture’s strong relationship with President Trump is based on his longstanding commitment to farmers, growers and ranchers. That is why farmers represented by the American Soybean Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, and International Fresh Produce Association are imploring the administration to carefully consider the content and consequences of the forthcoming Make America Healthy Again Commission report before it is finalized. “Despite the effort of many of our organizations to work with the MAHA Commission to provide factual information about American food production, we have heard disturbing accounts that the commission report may suggest U.S. farmers are harming Americans through their production practices and ‘creating foods that is [sic] destroying our microbiome and bodies—leading directly to our chronic disease crisis.’ Nothing could be further from the truth. Nutrition matters, health matters, and the confidence of consumers in the food supply matters tremendously. Such a conclusion would run counter to the scientific evidence and decades of findings from the Environmental Protection Agency. “Should the MAHA Commission report baselessly attack and, worse yet, make claims that are simply untrue against the hardworking men and women who feed our nation, it will make further cooperation on this initiative very difficult and potentially put American food production at risk. We urge President Trump to ensure that the MAHA Commission report is based on sound science and evidence-based claims rather than opinions and preferences of social influencers and single-issue activists with little to no experience in actual farming or food production.” The groups represent hundreds of thousands of farmers across the United States—farmers whose livelihoods are at stake if the report turns to conjecture and opinion to form its content.",

    "title": "NCGA Comments on House Budget Reconciliation Legislation",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) today praised the passage of key tax extensions, championed by the organization, which passed the House Committee on Ways and Means as part of the budget reconciliation process. “We applaud the members of the House Committee on Ways and Means and Chairman Smith for approving these tax policies, which are important to the financial viability of the nation’s corn growers,” said Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “These important provisions in the federal tax code must be extended this year.” The bill includes many of NCGA’s federal tax priorities, including: Permanently extending key provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, including the expanded estate and gift tax exemptions and the qualified business income deduction. Renewing 100% bonus depreciation for five years. Extending and modifying the clean fuel production tax credit, referred to as 45Z, until 2031. The tax credit can help the biofuels industry make inroads into the aviation sector and attract investment into opening new markets for U.S. corn. NCGA also weighed in on the measure that passed the House Committee on Agriculture on Wednesday night. Corn growers recognized Chairman Thompson and members of the Agriculture Committee for shepherding key agricultural initiatives in a complicated political and budgetary environment. “We appreciate Chairman Thompson’s efforts to include key agricultural investments in must-pass legislation,” he said. The bill contains several of NCGA’s longstanding farm bill priorities, including: Addressing the affordability of federal crop insurance coverage for producers. The language expands support for beginning and veteran farmers and ranchers and provides improvements to the Supplemental Coverage Option. Doubling mandatory funding for the Market Access Program and Foreign Market Development Program, which will develop new markets and promote U.S. goods, helping to boost U.S. agricultural exports. Strengthening the producer safety net by investing in modifications to the Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage commodity programs that are more responsive to the current economic environment. Hartman said corn growers appreciate that the legislation increases the ARC coverage level and payment band and increases the statutory PLC reference price for corn to $4.10. However, corn growers remain concerned with the imbalance of investment across various commodities and potential impacts of the changes to the PLC program. NCGA is particularly concerned with the adoption of a new floor price of $3.30 for corn, which would create a new gap in price coverage if the national marketing year average prices for corn were severely depressed. The legislation unfairly expands the concept only to corn growers. NCGA continues to advocate for more meaningful reforms to existing base acres that underpin the eligibility for the ARC and PLC commodity programs. Those reforms were not fully included in the committee’s budget proposal. NCGA will continue to advocate for policies to ensure that all base acres, program eligibility and payments better reflect growers’ recent planting history. While acknowledging that the House Committee on Agriculture’s budget proposal contained some of NCGA’s farm bill priorities, the organization also voiced concerns with the overall process and its implications for future farm bills. “NCGA’s farmer leaders have long stood on the policy position that farm bills should be comprehensive and bipartisan, and that they should include farm programs and nutrition programs,” Hartman said. “Given that budget reconciliation provides only a partial pathway for select components of the farm bill, we would like return to a bipartisan, comprehensive approach to future farm bill debates.” The House Committee on Energy and Commerce included language that would rescind the latest EPA multipollutant rules and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's CAFE Rule. NCGA has called for inclusion of the language in the budget reconciliation bill. This is a significant action that would protect ethanol demand in the future. NCGA has called for inclusion of language in the budget reconciliation bill that would eliminate a regulatory barrier to consumers' year-round access to fuels with 15% ethanol blends, referred to as E15. “NCGA will continue to make the case to legislators to include E15 in the final reconciliation package,” Hartman said. “Providing nationwide, year-round access to these fuels would save consumers money at the pump and help farmers financially, while serving as a boon to rural economies. Including this fix in reconciliation offers the added benefit of eliminating the need for regulatory waivers and our analysis shows it would achieve significant cost savings.”",

According to the White House fact sheet, this covers $700 million worth of U.S. ethanol exports. NCGA had previously asked the Trump administration for increased ethanol access in the United Kingdom. The country is currently the second largest destination for U.S. ethanol exports, taking in 244 million gallons, which is 12.7% of the total U.S. ethanol exports for 2024.

    "title": "NCGA Encourages Trump to Include Corn in Bilateral Trade Agreementwith India",
    "content": "The president of the National Corn Growers Association said today that his organization fully supports the Trump administration’s effort to forge a new trade relationship with India, and corn growers urge the administration to include corn and corn co-products, such as ethanol and its byproducts, in any final agreement with the South Asian country. The comments came during an online press conference as the organization released data showing India would be a valuable market for the nation’s corn growers and benefit rural America should the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to open the market to American goods prove effective. “We applaud the Trump administration for the trade outreach it is conducting with India, and we will advocate over the next few months to encourage the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to include American corn exports in any new trade agreement it makes with the country,” said Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “Building a more level playing field for all American products to access global markets is exactly what corn growers need, especially as we face a projected third consecutive year of negative returns.” Hartman added that the organization will continue working directly with the Trump administration and with the media to highlight how beneficial an agreement with India would be for the nation’s corn growers. The Trump administration has made India the initial focus of its efforts to open new markets for U.S. exports. During a CNN interview in early April, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called out India for its barriers to accepting corn from the United States. India’s restrictions on genetically modified corn have blocked access for American corn imports, as 94% of American corn is genetically modified. India also imposes technical restrictions that prevent access for distiller dried grains with solubles, a byproduct from ethanol production used in animal feed, and limits U.S. ethanol imports. India’s stance puts U.S farmers at a distinct disadvantage and addressing these barriers would benefit American farmers. If the Indian government were to drop its restrictions on genetically modified corn, it could open the door to $235 million worth of U.S. exports each year, according to data released by NCGA. If the U.S. were able to supply India’s sustainable aviation fuel market, it would represent $434 million opportunity for U.S. corn farmers in the first year of the relationship. India would also stand to benefit from this arrangement, with greater access to high quality feed and an affordable and more environmentally friendly renewable energy source. The Trump administration has said it expects to have a framework agreement in place over the next 90 days, and the leaders at NCGA say they are hopeful that the president and his administration can make progress with India that will benefit rural America. “We know President Trump is excellent at making a deal,” said Hartman. “He’s off to a great start and we want to be a part of the final product.” Read Economic Data on Corn & India",

This decision means that duties will be placed on imports of the herbicide at a final rate determined later by the Department of Commerce. “We are concerned and alarmed by this ruling,” said Illinois farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “Corn growers should not be forced to rely exclusively on one domestic supplier. Today’s decision threatens to cause availability shortages for 2,4-D that will hamper the work of our farmers, who are facing a tough environment due to a prolonged period of high input costs and low prices.” The herbicide 2,4-D is a growth regulator that targets broadleaf weeds—which is a particularly problematic weed for corn growers to manage. The herbicide has minimal impact on grasses, making it useful for corn growers. Corteva Agriscience filed the petition in 2024 calling for antidumping and countervailing duties on imports of the herbicide from certain foreign suppliers. The U.S. Department of Commerce will now determine and issue final duty rates.",

The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) praised the decision. “This waiver will help corn growers and rural communities while saving consumers at the pump during a busy driving season,” said Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “We are deeply appreciative of President Trump and the EPA for making year-round access to E15 a priority.” Due to an outdated regulation, E15 cannot be sold at terminals beginning on May 1 and at retail stations starting on June 1. But the Clean Air Act gives EPA authority to temporarily waive these regulatory requirements to address pressing concerns, such as fuel shortages. In response to concerns from Midwestern governors, EPA also took action to waive provisions that would have hindered the sale of E10 gasoline in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Higher blends of ethanol have been shown to lower the price of fuels. President Trump has said he supports permanent year-round access to the biofuel, which would provide greater certainty and eliminate the need for regulatory action. NCGA is working with allies, including the petroleum industry, on federal legislation that would provide permanent, year-round access to E15.",

    "content": "As Congress prepares for the next steps in the budget reconciliation legislative process, corn grower leaders are highlighting federal tax priorities for the legislation. The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is calling on farmers from across the country to contact their policymakers to voice support for several key tax provisions. “Congress will soon act on important provisions in the federal tax code that must be extended this year,” said Illinois farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “We are working closely with our agriculture and small business allies in Washington to advance our tax priorities, but these policymakers also need to hear from corn farmers they represent.” As committee legislative markups are on the horizon, NCGA is working to advance the following tax priorities: Extending key provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, including the expanded estate and gift tax exemptions, the qualified business income deduction, and renewing the 100% bonus depreciation. NCGA is also working to protect the stepped-up-basis tax provision, which protects family farms that are transferred from generation to generation. Supporting tax incentives that boost domestic production and use of biobased products using American feedstocks. NCGA is working with stakeholders to formulate a potential tax credit that would help move renewable chemical and material technologies from research to commercialization. Ensuring the sustainable aviation fuel tax credit, referred to as 45Z, will increase domestic demand for corn by helping the biofuels industry make inroads into the aviation sector. Extending the tax credit would help create high-paying jobs and boost farm income across the country. The budget reconciliation process is a vehicle for expediting legislation on budget issues. If leaders in the Senate and House are in agreement about the budget provisions in the process, the legislation only requires 51 votes in the upper chamber and is veto-proof. Farmers interested in contacting Congress about these priorities are encouraged to visit the Action section of the NCGA website.

    "title": "USTRs Final Actions on 301 Shipbuilding an Improvement, NCGA Says",
    "content": "The Office of the United States Trade Representative on Thursday released final actions related to Section 301 fees on Chinese-made vessels arriving at American ports, making significant changes from the initial proposed actions. The development comes after the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) called for USTR to consider the impacts that the fees would have on farmers and provided suggestions for improvement. While direct impacts on agriculture are still being determined, the final proposal is a step in the right direction to mitigate impacts on shipments of commodities, which directly impact corn growers, say agricultural leaders. “Our concern all along has been that any fees placed on Chinese vessels could be passed on to American farmers who rely on those ships to export corn,” said NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “While we are still working to understand how this new version will impact the corn industry, we believe this final action is more workable than the initial proposal.” NCGA estimated that the original proposal could have cost corn growers as much as $0.64 per bushel, which translates to 14% higher costs from current price levels. The added cost had the potential to reduce U.S. corn exports and impede market access. Instead, the released action specifies that fees will be assessed on Chinese vessel operators and Chinese-built ships per voyage, not per port call, as was originally proposed. Additionally, fees cannot be imposed more than five times per year. And short voyages, vessels arriving empty, and vessels carrying less than 50,000 tons will be exempt from the fees. The action will occur in two phases to allow businesses to adjust, and for the first 180 days, applicable fees will be set at zero. The restrictions are an outgrowth of the Trump administration’s efforts to address a report showing China has given its shipbuilding and maritime industry an unfair advantage through financial support, barriers for foreign firms, intellectual property theft, procurement policies and forced technology transfers. To address the issue, the Office of the United States Trade Representative issued a proposal in March to place fees and other restrictions on Chinese vessels.",

    "title": "EP. 53 - Tax Policy Updates Corn Farmers Need to Know About in 2025",
    "content": "We need our reps in D.C. to protect the helpful policies and throw out the bad ones. It’s tax day, but some of the important policies that are helping your farm maintain profitability are in jeopardy if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is allowed to expire this year. Provisions like the Qualified Business Income Deduction, 100% Bonus Depreciation, and the increased Estate Tax Exemption are critically important to producers across the country. So in this episode, we’re talking with two of NCGA’s foremost experts about how these policies benefit farmers… and what we can do to preserve them. Andy Jobman is a farmer from Gothenburg, Nebraska, and chairs NCGA’s Risk Management Action Team, which has been researching the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act at the farm gate and building up our case to preserve it. And Wayne Stoskopf is NCGA’s Director of Public Policy, serving as the D.C. staff liaison for all matters involving tax policy. Together, they’ll explain why farmers can’t afford to lose these tax protections, what it means for rural communities, and why it’s critical for growers to contact their legislators about this issue. Direct Share Link: https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ncga?selected=PDM234462094 Transcript Andy Jobman Too many instances in the past, the tax burden of the next generation picking up the farm was too great. And you saw lots of people move off the farm. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been big for America's farmers. Wayne Stoskopf So we want to make sure that we're talking about the importance of extending these provisions, keeping bad ideas out of the tax code. Dusty Weis Hello and welcome to the Cobcast: Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the corn belt to the DC Beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you're following this show and your favorite podcast app and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at NCGA.com. I'm Dusty Weis and I'm just going to go ahead and wish everybody a happy Tax Day here… in that Tax Day could ever be a happy occurrence for anybody. But a quick reminder as well that if you haven't checked that off your to-do list yet, go ahead and step away from the podcast for a moment and finish up your duties there. We'll be here. We're not going to be talking about anything that is necessarily timely to your 2024 taxes yet. We're going to be looking to the future of tax policy and what it means for growers and some of the pieces that are set to expire this year with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Joining us today to talk about these important issues are Nebraska farmer and chair of NCGA's Risk Management Action Team, Andy Jobman. Andy and his team have been preparing for this year's big tax conversations on Capitol Hill for a while now. Andy, first and foremost, great to see you again. It's been a minute. Last time we talked, we were actually in DC out there advocating on behalf of growers on a different issue, trade with Mexico, but it's good to see you again. How are things out in Gothenburg? Andy Jobman Hey, thanks for having me on. Great to see you again too. Yeah, things are well out here in Gothenburg and central Nebraska. Finally had some decent rain last night. I'm looking outside to a few puddles and it's been a while for some rain as well. Dusty Weis Thank goodness. You went from an unplantably dry mess to an unplantably wet mess. That's exciting times. Andy Jobman Yep, I'd rather have that kind of mess. Dusty Weis That's good, that's good. You'll have some work to do real soon, I bet. And joining Andy today, of course, is NCGA's policy expert on tax and farm policy, Wayne Stoskopf. He'll be helping give us the big picture for where this tax talk might lead and why the term “budget reconciliation” should be on our radar. So Wayne, thank you so much for joining us. Wayne Stoskopf Happy to be here. Thank you. Dusty Weis So Andy, can you get us kicked off a little bit by telling us more about your operation in Nebraska? Your family's been out there working that land for a while. Tell us more about what you're growing out there and what you're seeing. Andy Jobman So our operations, a family operation, like over 90 % of the farming operations across the US. I farm with my younger brother and my dad. And we raise food grade white and yellow corn for Frito Lay. So all of our corn actually goes toward human consumption through Frito Lay's various products like Doritos and Tostitos. We also rotate our corn with soybeans, grow a little bit of alfalfa to support our cow-calf operation as well. So a medium sized operation by any argument’s sake, almost a hundred percent irrigated. We do not get enough rain to rely on that alone. So most of our crops are supplemented with some sort of irrigation. A lot of that is center pivot irrigation. So, you know, as you're flying across the Midwest, going from coast to coast, you see the circles down below. That's us. Dusty Weis Bullseye marks the spot, right? Well, Andy, and I've got to say it's a beautiful farming operation as well. I was actually just telling Wayne that your operation in Gothenburg, Nebraska will forever be representative in my mind of NCGA because when I started working with NCGA, golly, like six years ago now... the first thing that I saw was a bunch of video footage that Neil Caskey sent me to edit together for a web video, and it was all shot on your farm. And so it really helped me get my head in the game as far as what's going on with our members, what their operations look like. But from what you do out there to what you do with NCGA, what got you interested then in NCGA's risk management work? Andy Jobman Well, that's a good question. Previously, I was on our stewardship action team and was involved in conservation programs, different cost share programs that allowed farmers to implement sustainability practices on their farms. And some of that is tied back into the farm bill. After I kind of went through the leadership position on that, I had an interest in the risk management team, you know, also very heavily involved in the farm bill. Also involved with taxes as well. And, you know, when I started farming professionally, like, you know, not just carpet farming back in the day, but when I started farming professionally, we were going through a lot of changes in farm programs. That's, you know, when ARC and PLC kind of came into being. And so I remember as a young producer, going through all of the education events that universities and different extension offices would put on to educate producers on here's this new safety net program and how it works. And here's everything you need to know about which one to sign up for. I just remember that being a really kind of confusing and also fascinating time all at once and thought, you know, “Hey, this sounds like a really interesting team to be a part of since that's exactly what they focus on.” Dusty Weis It might not be the thing that most growers want to take an interest in, but where the rubber meets the road of the black and the red in the ledger at the end of the year, it's one of the most important things. Andy Jobman It really is, you know. We farm to survive on our own. We want good markets, want strong demand for our products and high prices. But ultimately we do need to have that safety net program to keep American farms in business from one year to the next and from one generation to the next. Yeah. Like you said, it's not obviously the most glamorous or exciting topics to talk about every single day, but they are very important and do require a lot of expertise and I'm thankful to have Wayne on staff. He's the man when it comes to not only the programs that we have, but also kind of the history and how we got to where we're at. So we certainly couldn't do what we do without Wayne's input. Dusty Weis I can imagine you guys have gotten to know each other real well over the past few years here, but Wayne, as the staff lead for risk management, working with Andy and the risk management action team, also as our resident expert on the subject, how do you help the team determine what to focus on for the future? And how early did you have to start preparing for tax policy changes that might be ahead here in 2025? Wayne Stoskopf It's certainly a balancing act of all sorts of farm policy, tax policy, changes in administrations, the political landscape. And we try to sprinkle in topics ahead of time. So it's not a big kind of bolus all at once where you're trying to digest everything all in one conversation. I'd say on tax policy, we really started digging in early in 2024 and then set up a project that then could provide us more information throughout the year as we were thinking about Congress beginning to put the wheels into place for this train that's going to leave the station later this year. A lot of folks are saying it's the Super Bowl of Tax for 2025. And we were in the mode for the last two years that we were in the Farm Bill. It's the Super Bowl of Farm Bill policy. It's the big arenas. So we've been trying to do both walk and chew gum and really, it took a lot of effort to just be at the point where we could start calling the plays in the Super Bowl that is happening now. Dusty Weis So tell me a little bit more about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act then. This is something that's important to farmers, but why is that? Let's lay it out on the table what the benefits have been for America's growers here. Andy Jobman Yeah. So the tax cuts and jobs act has been a really big, helpful policy item for America's farmers and ranchers. This comes as no surprise to any producers that are listening, but farming is a very capital intensive industry. Land is expensive. Machinery is expensive. All of the inputs are expensive. You know, when you start talking about running these operations as businesses, tax is a huge item, especially when you're passing an operation from one generation to the next. And recently, you know, we've had some lower commodity prices, right? So profitability hasn't been there. We've relied on not only our farm programs, but also lot of disaster and economic assistance programs to help shore up these losses across much of the growing regions across the United States. Obviously, we're always looking for new markets, new opportunities to grow that demand. Biofuels and trade and livestock consumption are three main buckets of where corn grain goes, right? And, you know, one exciting opportunity we have is sustainable aviation fuel possibly in the future. So that's one opportunity we have. But the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has really helped provide a lot of security and stability in terms of having an operation decide, okay, how am going to keep this operation profitable? And how am I going to keep this operation moving from one generation to the next? Dusty Weis And Wayne, from your perspective in DC, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this is something that's been on the books for a number of years here, but it's due to expire, right? It was put forward as sort of a temporary provision here. When is it due to expire and what sort of deadline are we facing? Wayne Stoskopf Yeah, the provisions that Andy's talking about expire December 31st, stroke of midnight, the end of this year 2025. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act overall also included a lot of really good provisions that have supported the economy on the corporate side. And many of those provisions are permanent, but the provisions on the individual side that impacts more of our farms, ranches, small businesses, a lot of those were set to expire at the end of this year. A few like bonus depreciation were stair-stepped down. So we've already seen an impact in the past couple of years of those provisions expiring a bit earlier. Dusty Weis So Andy, then as we're coming up on that expiration date and talks are getting underway in D.C. to extend potentially the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, what are some of the provisions that are a top priority for corn growers? Andy Jobman Yeah. So about a year ago, we started a study to really evaluate the most important ones to corn farmers and used example farms from across the country. Some of them are our own membership and looked at different sizes of farms too, right? Because there's all different kinds of farming operations out there. There's single household farm, multi-generational farms as well where you got several generations, several households living off of the same operation. And then operations even bigger than that, that have a lot of hired help. So we really broke it into three different categories based off of size and then evaluated how both extending and repealing these different facets of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would affect each one of those operations. And I don't think necessarily we found anything to be incredibly surprising. Rather it solidified our arguments and the importance of these different tax code items, and maybe emphasized which ones are maybe even more important or had a greater effect than maybe even we imagined they would. Dusty Weis Well, why don't we start with the qualified business income deduction? What is that and how does that hit the bottom line at a family farm? Andy Jobman Yeah. So the qualified business income deduction allows an operation to deduct 20% of an income as a qualified deduction. And that helps level the playing field a little bit for farms that are not organized basically as a corporation, which is the majority of farms across the United States. And as we looked at that 20% sounds like a pretty good number, right? Like that's a sizable amount of any person's income, but really in our study, the effects of that actually wound up to be two to three times that in terms of what the actual dollar amount meant to different operations. And of course that varies a lot from year to year. In some instances that 20% may not be that big in terms of dollars. Maybe it wasn't a very profitable year, maybe it was a drought year or we had a hail event or, you know, crop insurance event where all of a sudden the income wasn't there. And so we found that item to really vary a lot from year to year and was very dependent upon the events and economic situation that each farm found itself in from year to year. But yeah, it was still a very important asset for each farm to be able to take advantage of. Dusty Weis Okay, there's another provision out there that we want to protect. It's called the 100% bonus depreciation. What's that one and what does that mean? I recognize that term. My accountant has said that to me, but I don't know what the heck it is. Andy Jobman Yeah. So depreciation is something that farmers take advantage of. And really many businesses across America take advantage of, right? So that's the ability to deduct the cost of a capital purchase. Say it's a large piece of machinery, like a combine or a tractor, or even a storage shop and deduct that cost over time. Well, the 100% allows you to deduct that amount in the year that it was placed in service. So like, say I bought a tractor last week, right? If I, at the end of the year, have had a really great year and I have higher than expected income, I can elect to take that depreciation 100% in this year. What that allows me to do is offset some of my tax liability that I would have this year, right? So rather than write my check and then pay my taxes, I'm going to in turn say, Hey, I'm actually going to count all of this year's purchase of that tractor in this year. And in some instances, this comes into play maybe more so towards the end of the year after I've evaluated what my profitability is for this year. Machinery is expensive, large items that we use every day. They wear out, they need to be replaced, right? We want to keep up with the most accurate and precise and efficient technology as we can because, you know, farming is a very small margin game. And so they can spend that dollar on main street America at their local dealership. That dollar is multiplied through the local economy. And that's why that 100% deduction exists. Taxes are important. We need tax income to fund defense, fund the government for roads, bridges, you know, what have you. But at the end of the day, if you find yourself in this position and also are in need of making a capital investment in your operation, here's a great way to offset some of that tax income but still be able to keep your operation moving forward and support local businesses at the same time. Dusty Weis Right, the grower gets a new piece of equipment, which very often is more efficient or even better for the environment. Let's make sure we don't miss that. But also the local dealer, they're able to create jobs of the people that sell and maintain that equipment. And then on up to the equipment manufacturer, the people that build that combine too, they're moving another piece of equipment out of the factory and helping support those good factory jobs as well. So it really runs all the way through the economy. Andy Jobman Yeah, one interesting thing that we found, you know, one might think like, well, this is really benefiting, just the very large producers. But honestly, even in our study, small and medium farms showed a 100 to 300% increase in tax liability when we didn't have this available. And so these farms would be burdened with much higher tax liabilities, still would have to be needing to purchase that new tractor, but all of a sudden weren't able to, right? Because they weren't able to offset that taxable income with the purchase. So it affected both small, medium and large operations, which I think was maybe a little bit of a surprise, just in terms of how much it actually impacted farms of all scales. Dusty Weis Yeah, that's an incredible figure right there, that 100 to 300 percent times tax liability. I mean, that can be the difference between profitability and a very, very bad year for a lot of folks. But another provision that we're interested in protecting here, of course, is the higher estate tax exemption. Now, this comes into play when an operation transitions between generations. Can you tell us a little bit about this and why it's important to preserve? Andy Jobman Yeah, absolutely. And in order to kind of understand this, we kind of have to walk through a little bit of where we were before and where we are, and then potentially where we're going. So before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, an individual would be exempt upon their death, or they could exempt up to $5 million of assets when they transfer that asset onto their heirs. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act effectively doubled that to $10 million per individual, and then indexed it for inflation. So really eventually that 10 million becomes 13 million as an individual, 26 million as a married couple. Sounds like a huge amount of money. And it is. Dusty Weis It would be a big pile of money, but we're talking about assets here. Talking about the ground that you grow in. We're talking about the machine shed out back. And it's not that those things have gotten bigger or nicer over the years. It's that the value has gone up. So when these transitions happen, it's not like somebody's getting a huge pile of money. They're getting the same operation that's been there for generations. It's just valued so much more now because of inflation. Andy Jobman That's 100 % correct. To an outsider looking in, it seems like an outrageous figure, right? But when you start breaking that down, one average field out here in central Nebraska on the market today would bring well in excess of $1 million. That's just one field. Most average operations probably have 10, 12, 15 fields, of an average size. And so you start adding that up. Plus, like you said, the cost of machinery, buildings, the value of everything is always going up. And so to be able to pass that on without having to start over with every generation is really important. This is also set to expire this year and it rolls back to the original amount, indexed for inflation would be about 7 million. So that's a huge difference, right? When you're talking about tax planning, family succession planning, like these are plans that most families and operations don't change daily, right? We can't change daily. Like most decisions in a farming operation about renting land or making a purchase of machinery or making an additional purchase of land. Like these are very, very long term plans. In many instances it’s not just planning for like my generation, but also planning for my kids' generation should they choose to come back and farm. Dusty Weis Well, and when you're talking about that estate tax exemption, that could be the difference between the next generation taking up the reins and continuing the family farm or even just throwing their hands up and walking away and saying, “I'm done. I'm to go get a job in town.” Andy Jobman Yeah. That's exactly right. Too many instances in the past, the tax burden of the next generation picking up the farm was too great. And you saw lots of people move off the farm, which is really unfortunate because we lost a lot of really great people in rural America and there's fewer people. Farms have to get bigger in order to survive. It's not necessarily that farms want to be thousands and thousands and thousands of acres big. Like that takes a lot of management, takes a lot of manpower. Lot of stress, a lot of risk. But unfortunately, like that's the situation we're in. It take some economies of scale to make these operations run. One interesting thing I thought that came out of this study that we did, when we looked at across America and all facets of businesses and lifestyles, when you compare the number of transfers of assets that are affected by the estate tax and compare that to agriculture, this instance affects agriculture twice as much as the average American household across the United States. And I think that just underscores what we've been talking about this entire segment is how capital intensive agriculture is and how important it is to be able to pass on these assets from one generation to the next in order to preserve these family farms and preserve these businesses. Dusty Weis So now, Wayne, as our expert in DC on these things, I know that we touched a little bit earlier about the stepped up basis, which is above and beyond just extending these key TCGA provisions. But what are some of those other proposed changes that corn growers are trying to defend against right now? Wayne Stoskopf When looking at the landscape, a lot of the changes that Andy's mentioned are pieces that will expire if Congress doesn't act. But the stepped up basis is part of the permanent law, but it has been looked at for changes to raise additional revenue for the federal government. And so we saw a serious push probably in 2021, about four years ago, to change the way the capital gains rates are structured and to eliminate stepped up basis. And while we don't think it's going to be part of the just straight extensions, we are still messaging against that proposal, which would negatively impact so many farms and that business planning. So we want to make sure that as we're educating new members of Congress and talking about the importance of extending provisions that we're also not missing that opportunity to educate on behalf of the importance of some of those permanent provisions and maintaining stepped up basis. Dusty Weis It sounds like we've really got to play defense in addition to trying to get the extension to the TCGA stuff as well. Andy, as far as corn growers’ priorities long term, we can do tax policy. We can focus on playing defense against some of these provisions that also might come into play that would cause real problems for us. But at the end of the day, the best way to improve the economic outlook for farmers is just to grind more corn. And tax policy can really stimulate demand in the long run too. How does that work? Andy Jobman Yeah, it sure can. As we're looking forward towards expanding that corn grind, there have been several ideas floated around for stimulating new methods of utilizing corn as a resource, particularly for sustainable aviation fuel and a lot of these next generation fuel ideas in terms of increasing blends at the pump, providing more opportunity for consumers to participate in the usage of a clean burning environmentally homegrown fuel. And so this would be a much more of an offensive forward-looking idea of let's incentivize folks to come up and participate in the corn market, expand usage, and at the same time, you know, really improve our energy portfolio for the United States and eventually globally too. Aviation affects everyone across the globe. So does liquid fuels. We've seen countless examples, whether it be economic or weather related, where we still are very dependent upon liquid fuels and probably will be for the foreseeable future. And if we can improve that system by including a cleaner burning renewable source, by all means, why shouldn't we do that? And so incentivizing industry to expand on that, I think is an excellent opportunity, increases jobs, increases demand for corn, creates a more profitable and economically viable midsection of the United States that also affects the pocketbooks of everyday Americans from coast to coast. Dusty Weis So certainly this is a time of year when most growers are focused on getting a crop in the ground. But it's also really, really important right now for growers to make their voices heard on these topics. We're lucky to have folks like Wayne out in the DC office that kind of manage the day to day of this. But corn growers and their supporters really need to carry this message to the offices on the hill. Yeah, Wayne? Wayne Stoskopf Absolutely. And we've launched a call to action earlier this year to provide some sample messages from growers that can go directly to your member of Congress. Emails, calls, texts are all fantastic. And of course, as members are back in their districts and in the states, it's a great opportunity to talk about the importance of extending these provisions, keeping bad ideas out of the tax code and for some of the tax incentive places, trying some new things too. Andy Jobman The most important voice on Capitol Hill when it comes to agriculture issues is the farmer. You know, we have Wayne up there to keep tabs on everyone in DC and on the Hill on a daily basis, but ultimately the most important voice is the farmers, right? That voice of experience, people that are living and breathing and getting personally affected by all the decisions, right? So far on this call to action, we've had pretty good response. We've had over a thousand folks participating. If you haven't participated, be sure to visit ncga.com, make your voice heard there. We've had really great staff that have made it super easy to get involved with the click of a button and a few strokes of the keypad to personalize your message if you would like to. And so we've found that to be a very, very effective way to make issues known to our representatives on the Hill and add that personal touch of, hey, this is my family, my operation, my neighbors, my community. This is how this issue is affecting me. Dusty Weis Certainly NCGA does a great job of taking its members from the field and putting them outside of their representatives doors, knocking on doors, making phone calls, sending emails, connecting with our delegations. It's important work. But as we look to the year ahead, Wayne, I imagine that you probably feel the way sitting in DC as I do sitting here in Wisconsin. I'm not the kind of guy who's going to try to guess what's going to happen next in DC, but can you give us the lay of the land a little bit at least on how these extensions may or may not move forward? Wayne Stoskopf Absolutely. Given the amount of tax provisions that expire this year or have already expired, there will be legislation to extend them. The legislative vehicle that they're talking about using is budget reconciliation, which can rely just on a simple majority in the House and in the Senate. So it really unlocks the potential for larger pieces of legislation impacting spending and also revenue to go through with a simple majority and can skip the cloture process in the Senate. So there will be a big package called budget reconciliation put together throughout the spring and hopefully move in the summer. Everyone in Congress knows that business certainty is really key and they want to get ahead of the deadline of December 31st as much as possible. So we've heard everyone from president Trump to members of Congress talk about one big, beautiful bill. That's the focus right now, including tax in that conversation to get business certainty across the finish line as quickly as possible. Dusty Weis Well, and we know that as that situation continues to develop, you'll keep us posted from D.C. Certainly we'll continue to use the podcast as a vehicle to keep folks informed as well. But also check out NCGA.com. Make sure you're subscribed to the newsletter so you're getting the minute by minute updates as well. Because this is ultimately an issue that is really, really important to growers. It's also really, really convoluted. And so we really appreciate the two of you sharing your expertise today to get us caught up on these tax policy issues. Andy Jobman from Gothenburg, Nebraska, and Wayne Stoskopf from our DC office. Thank you both for joining us here on the Cobcast. Andy Jobman Thanks for having us. Dusty Weis And thank you for listening. We hope you'll join us again next month for another episode of the Cobcast: Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association. As a quick reminder, while Andy and Wayne might know a lot about this stuff, nothing that we've discussed today should be construed as financial advice.

    "title": "NCGA Launches New Phase of Consider Corn Challenge",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is launching its fifth iteration of Consider Corn Challenge, a contest in which participants can submit proposals for new uses of field corn that have quantifiable market demand. “Biobased products are a win-win for everyone,” said NCGA Research & New Uses Chair and Kansas farmer Chad Epler. “NCGA is investing in these biobased solutions and positioning corn as the feedstock of choice. To demonstrate our commitment to identifying and developing these new uses we are increasing the prize by $50,000 to a total of $300,000.” Previous winners of the contests have scaled up to the next phase of development, received additional grant funding, entered into joint agreements and obtained registration for state biobased production incentives. They’ve also received additional investment by state corn associations and have even won the Radicle Challenge, which invests a minimum of $1.5 million for those individuals and companies developing new uses for field corn. Låkril Technologies, for example, is a company that recently won the contest by developing a cost-effective method of producing acrylic acid and acrylates out of renewable feedstocks like corn. Acrylic acid and acrylates are used to make several products, including plastics, coatings, adhesives paints and can even be a key material in medical devices. “The Consider Corn Challenge brought Låkril Technologies visibility and contact with multiple corn grower associations and industrial corporations,” said Chris Nicholas, co-founder and president of Låkril Technologies and a past winner of both Consider Corn Challenge III and the 2024 Radicle Challenge. “These relationships allowed us to expand our business.” If all 19 winners of the Consider Corn Challenge I, II, III, & IV reached full commercialization with products available in the marketplace, the potential for additional corn demand could be approximately 3.4 billion bushels. “Corn growers continuously innovate by developing advanced, sustainable technologies that allow them to do more with less as they farm,” Epler added. “This contest is critical in identifying and accelerating new technologies for novel uses of corn, leading to more corn grind for growers, better products for consumers and overall economic development here in the U.S.” One to three winners will be selected for the Consider Corn Challenge V, with a total prize pool of $300,000, split equally between winners. The submission deadline is June 30 at 5 p.m. CT; and winners will be announced and showcased at the Bio Innovations Midwest event in Omaha, Neb., September 15-16.

    "content": "President Trump announced this week that the United States will impose reciprocal tariffs on its trading partners. In response to this announcement, Illinois farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman Jr. released the following statement: “Approximately 15% of the U.S. corn crop is exported every year, and international markets are critical to our bottom line. So, we are aware of the potential effects that these new tariffs could have on corn growers who are already faced with a troubling economic landscape. We encourage productive negotiations and have supplied the administration with ideas for removing barriers to U.S. corn, ethanol and other corn products as a path to help rectify trade imbalances and help corn growers be more competitive. “Brazil, for example, could eliminate the 18% tariffs it puts on imports of ethanol, which is a particularly egregious practice and one that we are pleased to see the president address. The country should move to quickly come to the negotiating table so that it can rectify this situation.”",

    "title": "NCGA President: US Should Not Impose duties on Key Herbicide",
    "content": "Corn growers and other farmers would suffer if the U.S. government granted a petition to place anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of an herbicide called 2,4-D, the president of the National Corn Growers Association told commissioners at the International Trade Commission today. “First, 2,4-D is a growth regulator that targets broadleaf weeds—which is a type of weed that causes significant harm to corn and 2,4-D has a minimal effect on grasses,” Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. testified. “This makes 2,4-D useful for corn, which is a grass, because it will kill the weeds but not the corn plants.” The testimony comes as ITC weighs whether the petitioner, Corteva Agriscience, was harmed by imports of the herbicide, a finding that would allow for the petition to advance. Growers have said they cannot solely rely on Corteva Agriscience, the only domestic supplier of 2,4-D, to meet nearly all the market’s needs. Farmers have also argued that 2,4-D has many benefits, including preserving soil health, which helps farmers achieve successful yields. “The use of 2,4-D is more environmentally friendly and climate-smart than the alternative, which is tilling,” Hartman told commissioners. “No-till farming uses herbicides to kill weeds while minimizing soil disturbances. This is important because keeping soil intact reduces soil erosion.” Hartman further noted that the duties come as farmers navigating tough economic times. “Corn prices are down 40% since 2022 and costs of farming, including inputs like herbicides, are at all-time highs,” Hartman said. “New herbicide tools are slow to come to the market, so placing new duties on 2,4-D would set American farmers back even further.” ITC will issue either a negative or affirmative determination of material injury in six weeks. If an affirmative determination is issued, the U.S. Department of Commerce would then determine and issue final duty rates. Read the Testimony",

    "content": "Lesly Weber McNitt, a longtime leader in Washington agricultural and policy circles, started this week as vice president of public policy at the National Corn Growers Association. McNitt previously worked at NCGA from 2017 to 2021 managing the organization's trade and biotech portfolios. In her new role, McNitt will lead NCGA’s Washington office, serve as the organization’s chief advocate and manage a staff of 11 people. Corn grower leaders say McNitt is a perfect fit for the role. “I have worked with countless advocates, lobbyists and ag leaders over the years, and I can easily say that Lesly is one of the best,” said NCGA CEO Neil Caskey. “Her skills, experience and strategic vision position her as the leader we need as we navigate a challenging economic environment and advance our legislative agenda on behalf of the nation’s corn growers.” McNitt said she is ready to hit the ground running. “I am thrilled to return to NCGA in this new capacity,” McNitt said. “Farmers are operating amid a dynamic policy and regulatory landscape with real repercussions for their livelihoods. I am honored to once again work with the NCGA team to advocate on behalf of our growers in the halls of power in Washington.” McNitt’s agricultural experience is extensive, having served in a number of top-level positions, including chief of staff for the Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, senior professional staff for the House Committee on Agriculture and most recently as a leader at the Eleanor Crook Foundation, a U.S. philanthropy dedicated to ending global malnutrition. McNitt replaces Brooke S. Appleton who left the organization in February to serve as a deputy under secretary at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",

    "title": "NCGA Calls for Exemptions on Shipping Restrictions",
    "content": "The president of National Corn Growers Association today asked the Trump administration to grant exemptions on bulk shipments for America’s commodity groups as it considers implementing fees against Chinese vessels to level the playing field between U.S. and Chinese shipbuilders. The request came through comments submitted by Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which is part of the administration. “Corn farmers are currently facing numerous challenges in the farm economy, including rising input costs, volatility in commodity prices, and stagnant market access opportunities,” Hartman said. “Adding further financial strain through higher transportation costs could result in more instability for our members, particularly those who depend on global export markets to remain competitive.” The restrictions are an outgrowth of the Trump administration’s efforts to address a report showing China has given its shipbuilding and maritime industry an unfair advantage through financial support, barriers for foreign firms, intellectual property theft, procurement policies and forced technology transfers. To address the issue, the Office of the United States Trade Representative issued a proposal that would impose steep restrictions on Chinese operators and U.S. carriers using Chinese-made ships. The restrictions could include fees of up to $1 million per U.S. port call servicing Chinese operators and fees up to $1.5 million per entry for all Chinese-built vessels, scaled based on the percentage of an operator’s fleet built in China. The proposed fees are expected to increase the cost of transporting bulk grain, which includes corn. According to a Market Intel by the American Farm Bureau Federation, these exporters could face an additional $372 million to $930 million in annual transportation costs. These costs could translate to an additional $.34 to $.64 per bushel of corn, which is almost always passed down to the farmer. Additional shipping costs couldn’t come at a worse time for corn growers. “Corn farmers are currently facing numerous challenges in the farm economy, including rising input costs, volatility in commodity prices, and stagnant market access opportunities,” Hartman noted. “Adding further financial strain through higher transportation costs could result in more instability for our members, particularly those who depend on global export markets to remain competitive.” While NCGA supports initiatives to strengthen American manufacturing and shipbuilding capabilities, Hartman said, an exemption for bulk grain shipments would allow the U.S. to address the problems caused by the Chinese government without hurting America’s farmers.

Corn growers are eligible for the program with a payment rate of $42.91 per acre for the 2024 crop year. The new program was authorized by Congress through the American Relief Act, which passed in December. The economic assistance comes as growers are facing multiple years of low crop prices paired with high input costs. “USDA has made implementation of economic assistance a priority,” said Illinois farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “We appreciate that the process should be straightforward for corn growers to apply and receive assistance.” The sign-up period will run through August 15, and USDA will mail pre-filled applications to producers over the coming days. Growers can also go online, beginning tomorrow or to their local Farm Service Agency to complete the process. Initial payments will be factored by 85% to ensure the total program does not exceed the funding provided by Congress. Once the sign-up period ends in August, USDA may provide a second payment if additional funds are still available. Congress also passed $20 billion in disaster assistance for the 2023 and 2024 crop years. Details for those programs will be shared at a later date, according to USDA officials.",

    "title": "Corn Growers, Congressional Champions Rally for Year-Round Ethanol Access",
    "content": "Corn grower leaders joined Rep. Adrian Smith (R-Neb.) and Congressional biofuels leaders at a press conference on Capitol Hill today to push for passage of legislation that would extend consumer access to fuels with 15% ethanol blends, known as E15 and Unleaded 88. “Eliminating barriers to high blends of ethanol would be good for farmers and the economy,” said Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “Especially as we face uncertainty in our foreign markets, increasing demand for corn domestically would be a much-needed boost for farmers and rural communities. The press conference comes as corn grower leaders push for a way to use the legislative process to eliminate an obsolete policy that bans the sale of E15 during the summer months. Corn growers have intensified efforts in recent months to convince Congress to act to extend consumer access to E15. Nearly 9,000 Corn growers and advocates from across the country signed a letter sent last week to House and Senate leaders calling for action on the issue. Growers had hoped that E15 access would be included in the continuing resolution that is being voted on this week, but that bill, packaged to keep the government funded, did not include mention of the language when it was introduced on Sunday. “We are very disappointed that extended access to E15 was not included in the continuing resolution,” Hartman noted during the press conference. “We appreciate the work of our allies in Congress who champion corn growers and our priorities and call on Congress to address this issue as soon as possible.” In February, the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act was introduced in both chambers of Congress with the support of congressional allies. In addition to Rep. Smith, those speaking at the press conference today were Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.), Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa), Mike Flood (R-Neb.) and Jim Baird (R-Ind.)",

    "title": "EP. 52 - Sen. Deb Fischer: Revving the Engine on Year-Round E15",
    "content": "Momentum is building for a legislative solution allowing the sale of 15% ethanol fuel blends year-round. Corn growers may have their best opportunity yet to advance a legislative solution that would allow the year-round sale of 15% ethanol fuel blends, also known as E15 or Unleaded 88. Such a move would stoke demand for corn and support growers who are battling stagnant corn prices and spiking input costs. Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer and her co-sponsors have reintroduced an E15 bill, which has broad bipartisan support. Nearly 9,000 corn growers and advocates from 47 states even sent a letter to House and Senate leadership this week calling for action on the measure. But the work is not done, and growers nationwide need to rally to the cause in order to make year-round E15 a reality. In this episode of the Cobcast, we’re joined by Sen. Fischer herself to discuss the importance of E15 legislation for corn farmers and the agricultural economy. Along with NCGA CEO Neil Caskey, she spotlights the coalition of support for the bill, the benefits of E15 for consumers and the environment, and the need for better messaging about agriculture's impact. They also touch on the current economic challenges facing farmers, the impact of tariffs, and the legislative progress needed to make E15 a permanent option. Direct Share Link: https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ncga?selected=PDM6953639234 Transcript Dusty Weis Hello and welcome to the Cobcast: Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you're following this show in your favorite podcast app, and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at NCGA.com. I'm Dusty Weis, and today we are talking about revving the engine on nationwide year-round E15 and the opportunity to get this across the finish line in DC once and for all. We've got the honor to be joined by Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska today, who recently reintroduced legislation to make year-round E15 a permanent reality for fuel consumers and corn farmers. We'll look at how we got here and why NCGA believes that this is the moment for E15. And joining Senator Fisher today is NCGA CEO Neil Caskey. So Senator Fischer, Neil, good morning. Deb Fischer Good morning. Neil Caskey Good morning Dusty. Great to be back with you on the show. Even better to have a guest like Senator Fischer. She is a fantastic leader, a fantastic American, and one of the biggest champions for corn that we have in Congress, in fact you were a recipient of our President's Award a few years back because of all the things that you do on behalf of Nebraska and America's corn farmer. So, Senator, welcome to our podcast. Deb Fischer Well, thank you, Neil, very much. It is, really a pleasure to be able to visit with you a little bit today about a topic I love, and that is agriculture and what we can do to help our ag producers across not just my state in Nebraska, but across the country as well. Dusty Weis Well, Senator Fischer, we appreciate your making the time to join us from DC today. So the hustle and bustle of Capitol Hill, we might hear in the background from time to time. Good to have you. You grew up in Nebraska. You're certainly no stranger to agriculture issues, and I'm sure a lot of that experience centers around the ranch where you and your husband raised your family, the same ranch that two of your sons now operate. Can you tell us a little bit more about that? Deb Fischer Well, I met my husband, Bruce, at the University of Nebraska. I fell in love with a rancher, so leaving Lincoln and moving to the sandhills of Nebraska just was a wonderful life. Wonderful life. Being able to raise our three sons on the ranch. And now we have grandchildren on the ranch. So fourth generation Nebraska sandhills ranchers, right there in the heart of the sandhills. Dusty Weis Well, Senator, anybody who's spent time in Nebraska knows that its heart is in its rural community. So before we move on to ethanol, in your experience, tell us a little bit about the state of the rural economy in Nebraska and across the country right now. Deb Fischer You know, we are obviously worried about corn prices right now. We are concerned about the costs, the input costs that our producers are facing. Cattle prices are pretty good. They're pretty high now. But also the input costs, they're high. It's been estimated by USDA that we're going to see over $5 billion decline in those cash receipts this year for corn farmers. I'm worried about that. Of course, when we hear about tariffs, all of us get a little nervous. I want to see just what President Trump, his plans for that, his ability to use that tool of reciprocal tariffs as a negotiating tool for him so we can make good deals for ag producers. In fact, I just had a meeting yesterday with Secretary of Ag and the EPA administrator. So we're talking about a number of things that can happen, opportunities that can be helpful for ag producers across this country. Neil Caskey And Senator, I hope you know just how grateful we all are here at corn for all you've done for us and in general, and certainly ethanol in particular. We are especially grateful for your leadership on E15 or unleaded 88, as we call it at the pump. And if we could go behind the scenes just for a minute on your bill. And we all know that working together is the only way that you can get anything done out there and in Congress. And we also know that you do that really well. And so can you tell us a little bit about the bill and how it came together with your fellow co-sponsors? Deb Fischer Well, obviously, ethanol is important for the state of Nebraska. It's important for our corn producers in the state. And that means it's important for our rural communities as well. So in 2015, it was the first year that I introduced the year-round sale of E15. We want to continue to build our coalition. You know, we started out we had senators from corn states, Republicans and Democrats came together in order to promote the idea and to the bill itself, to be able to have that year-round sale of E15. We’ve grown our stakeholders. We have grown the participants in what I call this good movement to be able to have year-round sale of E15. This last year, we added the American Petroleum Institute, we added refineries. My good friend, Senator Shelley Moore Capito, who's from the state of West Virginia, a coal state, and she chairs the EPW committee. She is on as a co-sponsor last year and again this year. So we have strong support here, came really close, really close last year to getting this done. And we're working hard to continue to promote this bill and get it done this year. Dusty Weis Senator, certainly we’re familiar here at NCGA with the benefits of a year-round E15 blend. But as you're out there looking for co-sponsors, bringing in organizations like API, beyond just supporting rural economies and supporting growers, there are a lot of other benefits there that we can use to turn this into a really big tent issue as well, right? Deb Fischer Exactly. Using E15, it's good for the environment. It's good for our ag producers, good for our rural communities, but it's also great for consumers. You know, that's a message I think that sometimes we don't do a good enough job of promoting that E15 is good for consumers. The price is lower at the pump. So we need, I think, to be better messengers in trying to get that across to not just the stakeholders, not just people we and businesses we want to bring into our coalition, but to consumers as well. Dusty Weis Neil, from your perspective, in the heart of corn country, why is this legislation so important to growers? Neil Caskey Yeah, and I'll just add to what the senator was saying about this coalition. I remember and hats off, Senator, to you and your colleagues, for bringing that broad-based coalition together. We started making rounds because of the way that you fashioned this bill. We were making the rounds on the hill. We had corn, we had ethanol, we had the petroleum industry. We had retailers that were together for the first time. If you go back ten years, you know, you we don't want to relive those battles of the past. It's so refreshing to be working as a liquid fuels industry like we are right now. And Senator, I just want to say thank you for giving us that opportunity. And I think the first office that we went into together a few years back really raised some eyebrows in a very, very positive way. I know that that takes a lot of pressure off of you and your colleagues. When we are working together as a liquid fuels industry like we are right now on E-15 and that has made a tremendous difference. So thank you for bringing that together. Dusty, I know you asked about why this is important to corn. Obviously this is about a third, ethanol is about a third of our demand. And so, you know, you've worked with us and you know that our focus is all about demand creation. Given the state of the farm economy right now. And obviously the Senator just talked about that, obviously we're in a tough spot and our focus on demand creation needs to intensify by a factor of about 100. So we're expecting another really big crop this year. USDA is forecasting about 94 million acres of corn going into the ground this spring. Depending on what happens with the tariff situation, that number could go even higher. So finding a home for all of that corn or non-liquid gold, as President Trump referred to it, which I love this past summer is going to be a really, really high priority for us. Every 1% increase in the blend rate increases corn demand by about 500 million bushels. And so just to be clear, this E15 bill is not a mandate. Not at all. It just addresses the outdated regulations that prevents fuel retailers from selling year-round E15 across the US. And we talked about the benefits to the consumer, it's about 20 to 25 cents less per gallon than regular gasoline. And so we think given that discount, we think folks when they get an opportunity to do so that they are going to select E15, they're going to buy a lot more of that fuel. And that in turn is going to finally drive corn grind. That's why this bill is important to the American corn farmer, Dusty. Dusty Weis Senator, certainly here in the Midwest we’re familiar with the benefits of ethanol. But as you work to now build support among your colleagues in Congress to get this bill over the finish line, are you finding it's getting purchase with folks that are not from the Midwest, from some of those key allies that we need to build outside of the Corn Belt as well? Deb Fischer We have to be better messengers. And this applies not just to corn farmers, not just for this particular bill, but as people in agriculture, we have got to drive the narrative, how important agriculture is to this country. It is national security and how important it is for our environment. A lot of times we don't blow our own horn. So every ag group that comes into my office, I always say to them, you have to drive the narrative. You have to be messengers. I have been so excited when I see young people, young families that are coming back to the farms, coming back to their ranches because they need to be the face of ag producers. They need to say, we live on the land, we take care of our land, we manage our resources appropriately and as good, good stewards, we take care of our land. We take care of our water. We take care of our livestock. That has to be a message. So as we deal with people here in Washington, I think it's helpful for all of our ag producers out there to continue to talk to their representatives. No matter where you live, talk to your representatives, talk to your senators, and talk about the positive things with agriculture. That makes it easier then for me to reach out to other offices here in the United States Senate, to senators who don't have ethanol. They have really not a big connection to agriculture. When they hear from people back home, that makes it easier for me here in Washington. Neil Caskey Well, Senator, when I think about a state that can tell the story of agriculture, no one does that better than Nebraska. I say that as a Missouri Tiger fan and graduate. But obviously, as you well know, your college is the Cornhuskers, and so I don't know if there is a more appropriate tribute to the American corn farmer than the University of Nebraska. So thank you for that. We've got some catching up to do at the University of Missouri, but hopefully that will happen. Senator, can you tell me how your bill is getting traction in the Senate right now? Deb Fischer You know, I think it was extremely important when we saw President Trump on January 20th, his first executive order, it touched on E15 and the importance of having E15 in the mix. When we talk about promoting American energy, that is extremely important. Obviously in President Trump's first term, he was very supportive of ethanol and the year-round sale of E15. We had a few meetings in his office at that time. We saw the EPA about a month ago. They released a rule that we can have that waiver, we can have that sale of E15 in the summer of 2025. That's helpful, but that doesn't address our main concern. We want to make the sale of E15 permanent. So earlier I had referenced to you about having a meeting yesterday with Secretary Rollins and Administrator of the EPA, Lee Zeldin, and this is what we were talking about, the sale of E15 and how we can work to promote that, how we can get this done sooner rather than later. They are both good advocates for us. So we need to thank our ag secretary and also the administrator of the EPA. They're being good advocates with us. President Trump has been great in the past. He started off the administration, this current administration, with that good sign with the executive order. And now it's up to us to be able to continue to be good advocates, to continue to push to get this done sooner rather than later. And that's what we're trying to do. You know, I had Senator Chuck Grassley with me, who brought really a good perspective to ethanol from his years of experience there. Senator Roger Marshall, he came in to the meeting yesterday with some graphs and showing the importance of ethanol in the mix of how corn is marketed. Joni Ernst was there at the meeting as well. So to be able to continue to be out front, to continue to be vocal about this, I think that's going to be extremely important and bring our stakeholders on board and have them be out front and vocal as well in order for us to get this done. Dusty Weis Ultimately, Senator, the year round E15 blend, if it passes Congress and we're hopeful that it will right now. But then it comes down to the president's desk for a signature there. Given these signs of support that we've seen so far from the administration, we feel pretty confident that this would get a stamp of approval? Deb Fischer I am pretty confident. I'm very confident that the president would be signing this bill, and that's why it's important to get it to him. It's the way we need to get this done. As I said, the chairman of the EPW committee, Senator Moore Capito, she is a co-sponsor of my bill. That's helpful as well to expand that coalition. So it's going to continue to take work. This is now my 11th year of working on this. And gosh we got to get it done. Got to get it done guys. Dusty Weis Well, certainly the great strength of the National Corn Growers Association is that its members are legion. So, Neil, for our members who are listening right now, what can they do to help get this bill over the finish line and help out Senator Fischer and her colleagues here? Neil Caskey Yeah, because we don't, Senator, we don't want you working a 12th year on this bill. Deb Fischer But, but now, Neil, I will if needed. I will if needed. But like I said, we want to get this done this year. Neil Caskey And we know that, that's what I would say, Dusty, that the very first thing that folks can do is to be sure that we thank our champions, like Senator Fischer, for carrying our water out there in Washington, DC on this particular issue. And certainly a lot more for that matter. I guess I will model that behavior, Senator, and I will say on behalf of the Corn Board and all the members of the National Corn Growers Association, sincere thank you for all of your leadership on our issues, and certainly ethanol as well. I guess the second way that listeners can help is to reach out to their respective delegations and ask for co-sponsors of both bills in the House and the Senate. And so we have a call to action right now that is supporting that. So does the American Farm Bureau Federation. So this is obviously important to all of agriculture. And so we are working as part of a broad based coalition of agriculture, energy, etc.. And so trying to drive co-sponsors of this bill. Senator, we just wrapped up a call to action. It was the the most successful one in the history of NCGA. And so we have gathered about 9000 supporters of E15 in just a handful of days that have signed a letter that we will be sending to congressional leaders and certainly sharing with you that demonstrates the support that exists right now in rural America, actually just across all of America for E15. And so, Senator, we are doing all we can to help you out there, get this bill done. And, we are just grateful for everything that you're doing right now on E15 and looking forward to the day when we can celebrate this win. Dusty Weis Neil, stepping back to the big picture for a second here, because it's that time of year, of course, when growers are looking to the year ahead and making their plans to plant, we've certainly heard a lot from the new administration about how the president is prioritizing domestic markets. E15 is a great opportunity to boost that, but it's top of mind for a lot of growers right now that this week the president imposed some tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China. How is that affecting growers’ minds right now? Neil Caskey We're certainly following that. We like all of agriculture, we are an export-dependent industry. At corn, about 15% of our crop is exported. Most of it goes into Mexico. We send a lot of ethanol north into Canada. And so obviously when tariffs involving those trading partners, plus China, where we don't actually send a lot of corn these days, you know, certainly that does put us a little on edge when you think about just the state of the farm economy right now, you know, that has us nervous. So we also appreciate that the president is, as you've said, prioritizing domestic markets. And so, you know, we think ethanol is one of those markets that needs to be prioritized. We cannot be the dominant energy player that I know this administration wants us to be without ethanol. And so this is a very important bill right now for farmers that are about to plant a lot of corn this year and a little bit nervous about having enough markets to obviously sell all that corn into. And so it would be a wonderful gesture and signal to the American corn farmer by getting year round nationwide E15 done. Dusty Weis Well, certainly it's going to be another active year in Washington. And we really appreciate Senator Fischer taking time out from her day to fill us in a little bit on what's going on out in DC right now, but thank you both so much for the conversation. It sounds like year-round E15 is a win for both the fuel consumer and corn farmers. So thank you for joining us here on the Cobcast. Deb Fischer Thank you Dusty. It is always just a privilege. It's a privilege to work with you, with your organization, with all of your members. I enjoy it tremendously. So thank you for your support. Thank you for reaching out to your members and having that call to action. We are going to continue to work hard to get it done. Dusty Weis And thank you for listening.

    "title": "Thousands of Farmers Call for Immediate Action on E15",
    "content": "A letter signed by nearly 9,000 corn growers and advocates from 47 states was sent to House and Senate leadership today calling for action to remove an obsolete federal policy that prevents the sale of fuel with 15% ethanol blends, often referred to as E15, during the summer months. “A legislative solution for consumers to access year-round E15 comes at no cost yet would provide critical support to our nation’s energy sector, overdue relief to American families, and provide necessary economic security to rural communities,” the letter said. The letter was sent by the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). The sheer number of signatures in the letter is testament to the strong sentiment about increased ethanol demand among farmers, especially as commodity prices drop and input costs increase. “Standardizing year-round E15 will result in an increase in corn demand of about 2.3 billion bushels per year,” the letter stated. “Considering that about one-third of corn produced in the U.S. is used for ethanol production, this demand creation will result in an impressive improvement in profitability for operations across the nation – and rural communities will reap the benefits.” Moving a legislative fix to year-round E15 across the finish line has been a goal of growers for years. Congress came close to approving a legislative fix at the end of 2024 but fell short. In mid-February, corn grower allies in the House and Senate introduced the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act to address the issue and, along with corn grower leaders, have pushed hard for its passage.

    "content": "Illinois farmer and National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) President Kenneth Hartman Jr. sent a message today to farmers asking them to add their voice in support of legislation allowing the sale of year-round E15. Farmers can add their signature to a letter that urges Congress to quickly take up the issue to eliminate an obsolete policy that prevents the sale of fuel with 15% ethanol blends, often referred to as E15. “As traction continues to build on this issue, it is critical that corn growers make their voices heard, encouraging Congress to approve legislation to unlock access to E15 year-round,” Hartman said. The call to action comes a day after the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act was re-introduced in the House and Senate. The legislation would lift the ban on summer sales of E15. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued waivers allowing the sale of E15 during the summer months over the last few years. But growers and many Midwest governors have called for a permanent fix to the problem. The legislation under consideration would offer that solution at no cost to the government and provide certainty to farmers and consumers at the pump. In his message to farmers, Hartman said that the time is ripe for action and that Trump administration officials have been supportive of the legislation. “On his first day in office, President Trump signed an executive order addressing the need for a pathway to year-round E15 access,” Hartman said. “We are excited that this is a priority for the administration, but we need a legislative fix to provide a concrete resolution to year-round E15.” Growers came close to a win on the issue in December when language eliminating the ban was included in a continuing resolution to fund the government. But disappointment soon followed when the language was struck during negotiations. Hartman believes many signatures from farmers will further underscore for Congress the desire to fix this issue among farmers and rural America. SIGN THE LETTER",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) applauded members of the House and Senate today for introducing legislation that would extend year-round consumer access to fuels with up to 15 percent blends of ethanol, often referred to as E15. The legislation, called the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act, would remove an obsolete policy that prevents the sale of E15 during the summer months. The legislation was met with praise from the nation’s corn grower leaders. “Extending nationwide consumer access to E15 would save drivers money at the pump while boosting the farm economy,” said Illinois farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “We applaud our allies in the House and Senate for sponsoring and co-sponsoring this legislation.” The current policy preventing summer sales of E15 has left corn growers who rely on the sale of ethanol with a great deal of uncertainty. Drivers have also been faced with higher gas prices during the summer vacation season. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued waivers over the last few years. But growers and many Midwest governors have called for a permanent fix to the problem. Today’s legislation would offer that solution. The bills are led in the House by Reps. Adrian Smith (R-Neb.), Angie Craig (D-Minn.), Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.), and Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa). Senate leads are Sens. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill). Language in the current legislation was originally included in a continuing resolution to fund the government in December but was struck before that legislation was passed. Corn grower leaders at the time expressed their dismay with that development but are now more optimistic about the chances of advancing this legislation. “Congress has an opportunity to finally get this legislation across the finish line,” Hartman said. “This is extremely important to corn growers and rural communities and comes at no cost to the federal government. We encourage Congress to move quickly to pass this legislation and send it to Pres. Trump for signature.”",

    "title": "NCGA Encouraged by Mexicos Actions on Genetically Modified Corn",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association expressed optimism today after Mexico rescinded portions of a decree that banned genetically modified corn. The development is an outgrowth of corn grower advocacy that led to a dispute panel that ruled in late December last year that Mexico had violated its commitments under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement when it banned the imports. “We are encouraged by today’s development and pleased by the impact of corn grower advocacy,” said Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr . “Mexico must comply with the report and eliminate all measures that ban or restrict the trade of genetically modified corn.” The settlement process is still ongoing, Hartman noted. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador first set off alarms in the Corn Belt in December 2020 when he initiated a decree to ban genetically modified corn by the end of 2024. At the time, NCGA began outreach to the Trump administration to head off the ban. Those efforts continued with the Biden administration as well as with members of Congress and Mexican officials. The organization’s leaders argued that the ban would significantly harm growers and rural communities, especially because Mexico is the number one export destination for U.S. corn. NCGA’s efforts intensified in 2023 when the Mexican president issued a decree banning genetically modified white corn, effective the following day. NCGA and state corn grower groups responded by pushing USTR to file a dispute settlement under USMCA, which it eventually did.",

Comparatively, the average cost to produce corn has declined by just 6%.” Hartman highlighted a recently released NCGA report that identified six key targets for enhancing the competitiveness for U.S. corn, including developing new foreign markets, expanding consumer access to higher blends of ethanol and fueling innovation in new uses research. In his testimony, Hartman also also called for a timely rollout of economic and disaster assistance from the American Relief Act and passage of a robust farm bill that includes NCGA’s priorities.

The tax credit, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, is designed to help the agricultural industry make inroads into the aviation sector. Farmers have long awaited today’s release. The new rule removes the requirement to bundle climate smart practices and instead allows corn to qualify as an eligible feedstock if individual practices are used to grow it. But farmers have also asked for more clarity on how they will benefit from the law. “We are appreciative of Secretary Vilsack for ushering the process along and increasing the number of corn bushels that would qualify for the tax credit,” said Illinois farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “It is still unclear whether that is enough to enable farmer participation.” Additional opportunities for improvement would include the use of a book and claim system and the expansion of practices that would qualify for the credit, both of which would allow for greater farmer participation. USDA will open a 60-day public comment period in which NCGA will continue to communicate the role farmers are playing in producing feedstocks for biofuels. “Corn growers are poised to meet this market demand if given the opportunity,” Hartman said. “We look forward to working with the Trump administration as this process evolves.”",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) today published its 2025 Corn Competitiveness Report, providing a roadmap for the incoming Trump administration and the new Congress to bolster the economic outlook for farmers and rural America. The report comes as corn growers are forecasted to face a third year of negative returns in 2025. “The U.S. is a corn-producing superpower, growing about one-third of the world’s corn and doing so more sustainably than anywhere else on earth,” the report noted. “But the future of this American-grown powerhouse is in jeopardy as costly and burdensome regulations and outdated, unfavorable policies hinder American corn farmers’ market access resulting in high costs and low market prices.” According to the report, the U.S. can turbocharge American competitiveness by focusing on six key targets: Increasing global market access for U.S. corn Expanding the use of U.S. corn in ethanol Strengthening farm risk management Preserving the American farm family legacy and farmland access Protecting access to agricultural innovations Strengthening use of U.S. corn in American products The report provides specific examples of the ways in which the U.S. can achieve these targets. These include developing new foreign markets, passing legislation that will expand consumer access to higher blends of ethanol, ensuring sensible regulations are in place and extending estate tax exemptions. “If the United States is going to build the greatest economy in history, supporting American corn farmers is foundational,” the report noted. “Corn growers need an environment where they can be innovative, productive and profitable. An environment with unobstructed access to necessary inputs, management tools and markets.” Corn grower leaders argue that a change in Washington offers an opportunity to address these challenges. They say by following the report’s recommendations, the Trump administration and Congress can boost the economy and ensure American corn growers are competitive on the world stage. READ THE REPORT",

    "content": "The Department of Treasury released more details today about a tax credit, known as 45Z, that is designed to help the biofuel industry make inroads into the aviation sector. While today’s news included more information, corn grower leaders said they still need better clarity about the specific environmental practices that will be required for accessing the credit. “What a missed opportunity for growers,” said Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “We have spent the last year providing Treasury officials with fact-based information in hopes of helping them develop clear and realistic guidelines for qualifying for the tax credit. It’s frustrating that our feedback fell on deaf ears.” The burden to preserve this credit and to make it useful now shifts to the new administration, Hartman noted. The 45Z tax credit was part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in 2022. The law provides tax incentives to refineries that produce biofuels that can be used in commercial aircraft to lower greenhouse gas emissions. In May of last year, the U.S. Department of Treasury released its guidance on eligibility for the credits. Those guidelines troubled growers because it required them to implement environmental practices that are impractical in certain climates. Corn grower leaders have since provided data-driven information to Treasury officials as they revised the guidelines. Read the Notice of Intent to Propose Regulations on the section 45Z Credit and a notice providing the annual emissions rate table for section 45Z.",

    "content": "In a major win for the nation’s corn growers, a dispute panel ruled today that Mexico violated its commitments under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement when it issued a decree that banned genetically modified corn imports in early 2023. The decision was met with praise from the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and other corn grower advocates who had called on the United States Trade Representative to file the dispute. “This is an incredible development for the nation’s corn growers and rural communities,” said Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “This outcome is a direct result of the advocacy efforts of corn grower leaders from across the country. We want to thank the nation’s growers for speaking out and U.S. officials for listening and acting.” Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador first set off alarms in the Corn Belt in December 2020 when he initiated a decree to ban genetically modified corn by the end of 2024. At the time, NCGA began outreach to the Trump administration to head off the ban. Those efforts continued with the Biden administration as well as with members of Congress and Mexican officials. The organization’s leaders argued that the ban would significantly harm growers and rural communities, especially because Mexico is the number one export destination for U.S. corn. NCGA’s efforts intensified in 2023 when the Mexican president issued a decree banning genetically modified white corn, effective the following day. NCGA and state corn grower groups responded by pushing USTR to file a dispute settlement under USMCA, which it eventually did. “NCGA has been active each step of the way, sounding the alarm about the impact Mexico’s actions are having on farmers,” Hartman said. “This win illustrates the power of corn advocacy.” Since the enactment of USMCA, the formation of dispute panels has been uncommon and must meet a high threshold of requirements. Now that a decision has been made, NCGA leaders say they will work with USTR and the incoming administration to ensure the ruling is enforced. MORE NEWS",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) released its fourth-quarter Economic Update today, reporting on everything from harvest season to the findings from a recent trade study. “These quarterly updates can help us understand what is and isn’t working in the ag economy and this quarter is no exception,” said NCGA Lead Economist Krista Swanson. “Our latest issue provides insights on some of the current pressing issues our farmers are facing.” Highlights in this issue include: The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports on a rapid harvest season. Warm, dry fall weather across the Corn Belt provided optimal conditions to rapidly harvest the 2024 corn crop, according to a USDA report. The rapid pace gives farmers an edge on any fall field preparations needed for the 2025 crop and more time to finalize production and year-end financial plans, which is critical in the current high-cost and low-price environment. A new study shows a tariff war would hurt growers and rural communities. A recently released study by NCGA and the American Soybean Association shows a reignited tariff war would limit market access, reduce corn prices and increase market competition for U.S. corn. Alternatively, the report showed that renewed trade agreements can benefit the corn industry if they include provisions like purchase commitments that could support corn prices. As the U.S. government addresses trade concerns, consideration of farmer impact is important. Government projections show net income for farmers drops. The USDA projects U.S. real net cash income for the U.S. farm sector will drop 9.6% in 2024. This decline follows a 23.7% drop in 2023. This is substantial now, but also from a historical perspective. The combined two-year percent decline is the largest two-year percent decline since 1975. Because corn growers can’t withstand negative returns for an extended period, NCGA is calling for economic assistance in the short run, a new farm bill and long-term demand that supports the market price. NCGA releases the quarterly update to provide readers with an overview of trends, challenges, opportunities and market conditions. Read the Update",

For more information about the review process, evaluation criteria and program eligibility, click here. AMCOE’s Competitive Grants Program offers research grants for projects focused on solving profit-robbing aflatoxin issues for farmers. The program was developed by a consortium of southern state corn checkoff boards to provide a unified approach to funding projects affecting growers across the region. NCGA serves as the management structure in order to leverage more dollars for solving aflatoxin issues and to build strong regional teams which would be highly competitive for federal, public, and private funding. \"Corn growers are steadfast in their commitment to delivering safe, top-quality products to consumers,\" said Texas grower and AMCOE Committee Chair Charles Ring. \"Thanks to AMCOE's initiatives, we’ve achieved meaningful progress in identifying and reducing risks from aflatoxin and other mycotoxins. Our competitive grants program is fueling innovative research and equipping our industry with better tools and solutions to address these challenges.\" Projects funded through AMCOE’s grant program for 2025 should focus on one of these three priority research areas: Methodologies and technologies that prevent and/or defend against the presence of aflatoxin In-field mitigation measures Post-harvest strategies While corn farmers in southern states experience aflatoxin challenges every year, these challenges may present themselves in any corn region of the United States when the crop comes under stress. Therefore, the benefits of such research—particularly as outlined in the three priority areas—are truly national in scope. Proposals will be considered regardless of the party’s geographic region. Any state wishing to provide additional funding for AMCOE is encouraged to do so.",

    "content": "A change in leadership presents new opportunities AND challenges for America's farmers. After an unprecedented election cycle, we finally know what the American political landscape will look like in the Congressional term ahead. The election results include victories for more than 90 percent of the candidates backed by CornPAC, and have big implications for farmers across the country. So in this episode of the Cobcast, we're going to analyze the takeaways of the Republican sweep of D.C. leadership, the effectiveness of NCGA's political strategy, and the key races that will shape ag policy in the new Congress. We're joined by NCGA’s Vice President of Public Policy Brooke Appleton, and Director of Grassroots and Political Strategy Sadie Knight. And we'll discuss the implications of the new Congressional leadership, President-elect Trump's forthcoming cabinet selections, and pressing agriculture issues, particularly trade policy, that will be at the forefront as we move into 2025. We'll also reflect back on lessons from this election cycle and the importance of rural votes in shaping the political landscape. Direct Share Link: https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ncga?selected=PDM6660800121 Transcript Brooke Appleton So we know Republicans are to be in charge of Congress and the White House. So it was a Republican sweep. And so that really starts a lot of strategic discussion around how we approach the next Congress, how we approach the next administration. But then also leaves a lot of questions, right, because there's just a lot of stuff we don't know as far as who's going to be in what positions, what policy priorities are going to be. Dusty Weis Hello and welcome to the Cobcast: Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you're following this show in your favorite podcast app, and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at NCGA.com. I'm Dusty Weis, and today we are going to be discussing the results of this fall's election with two of our foremost staff experts and NCGA’s Vice President of Public Policy Brooke Appleton, and Sadie Knight, our Director of Grassroots and Political Strategy. Sadie, it's great to have you on the show. And, Brooke, welcome back. Brooke Appleton Thank you. Sadie Knight Thanks, Dusty. Dusty Weis Definitely a lot to pick through here. I swear I've actually probably not been sleeping as much as I should just because there's so much data and so much information to digest from the election that happened last week. We are recording this on November 13th. It is eight days after the November 5th election. Important to note that, of course, because there are still a few things being decided right now. But when we were initially talking about scheduling this podcast, we were kind of careful to pick a date when we thought that we'd be sure that we'd at least have results from the presidential election. Now, it turns out that did not take as long as a lot of folks expected it to. So take me through a quick recap. What happened on election Day? What do we know right now and what are we still uncertain about? Brooke Appleton Sure. And I'll jump in and then I'll let Sadie add in probably some details that I'm going to miss. But we had a policy call of kind of all the state associations the Thursday after the election, so two days after. And I kind of bucket it with what do we know, what do we don't know, and like what questions do we have? And so just very top line, we know Donald Trump is going to be the next president. We know the Republicans are going to be in charge of the Senate. And they're undoubtedly going to be in charge of the House, but that exact number, so we don't know what the margin is going to be, is yet to be set as there some races that have yet to be called and Sadie can speak to some of those that we're watching here in a minute. So we know those to be true. So we know Republicans are to be in charge of Congress and the White House. So it was a Republican sweep. And so that really starts a lot of strategic discussion around how we approach the next Congress, how we approach the next administration. But then also leaves a lot of questions, right, because there's just a lot of stuff we don't know as far as who's going to be in what positions, what policy priorities are going to be. We know some of that, but we don't know exactly how it's all going to unfold. What's going to be top of mind, how's that all going to work? So that's stuff that's going to come together. We're going to kind of know when we know. We can speculate on all kinds of stuff but there are certain things that, you know, we'll know when we know and then we can plan accordingly. But I'll let Sadie speak just briefly, I think to, you know, we had a lot of races we were watching across the country, and I know there's a few yet to be called, some are really close. Sadie Knight Yeah. So there's 12 House races that haven't been called yet and essentially those 12 will determine who has the majority at the House, albeit the map and the math works out to what Brooke said, Republicans to take the House. There's a few on that list that are what we consider champions of our priorities, and these are members that have stood up for our priorities in the House, that have championed policies that have sponsored/co-sponsored bills that we support. And so we're still watching about four of these. Marcy Kaptur in Ohio's 9th District her race has not been called. She has been really helpful on our priorities this past Congress and has been a huge supporter. Mary Miller-Meeks, of course, championed the Next Generation Fuels Act, her race hasn’t been called. And then two in California, John Duarte and Jim Costa, who are key players in the ag space in committee and also in their respective committees outside of the ag committee. And so we're still watching those four, but essentially we're waiting to hear those 12 for the Republicans to solidify their majority at the House. Dusty Weis It's worth noting at this point that CornPAC, the National Corn Growers Association political action committee, supported 116 candidates in the 2024 election cycle. Of the races that have been called so far, and of those 116, 104 have won their races. Could be more by the time this is all said and done. What would you say this says about NCGA’s political strategy and the members of Congress who support our policy priorities? Sadie Knight So I would say that NCGA’s political strategy is very methodical, it's very thought out. Our PAC is comprised of grower-members who make the decisions of where we give our money. We as staff advise them. We are constantly informing them with political analysts and pundits here in D.C. so that they are making the best decisions on behalf of our PAC. And we support candidates who champion our causes, and that's the criteria. And so I would say that that winning streak, if you will is because of the grower input that we have in the decision making process. It's also a reflection of the members’ service they provide to their constituencies, and their ability to at times cross party lines and find bipartisanship on these issues. We're supporting people who get stuff done here in DC, both on our causes and for their constituencies. And we bring in a diverse group of folks like growers to ensure that we're making the right decisions and make the right investments with those dollars. Brooke Appleton And I will say, you know, I've been around the corn world now for the better part of ten years and where we were ten years ago and where we are now is just light years on the PAC, on how we function internally. But also there's this big education piece about what are PACs and how do they operate, and where's our money actually going. And, you know, the more we did that over time, the more response we got from our grower leaders in various states, the more comfortable they got investing in the PAC. And I will say, you know, within the last five years, we've seen that total amount of money that we're giving in a cycle double. And that's huge. That's impactful. And that is very much a team effort from the grassroots all the way up to the staff. Dusty Weis Well and correlates directly with NCGA’s ability to again advance those priorities there. You highlighted for us, Sadie, some of the races that we're still watching that haven't been called yet, but let's look at some of the races that we know a result for. Are there any new faces that are going to be representing their districts in Washington that we're excited about, or any faces that are familiar to us that we're excited to see returning to Washington? Brooke Appleton There were definitely some races of some really key allies of ours that we were watching closely that we were very happy to see prevailed. At the top of my mind, I think about Angie Craig in Minnesota. She's a huge champion for us. She's a Democrat, she sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee and she's really, I would say, the only agriculture friendly Democrat on that committee for us. And so she was a big one. We were watching closely and she won handily. That is typically kind of a swing district, it's always kind of tough for her to get reelected there. But I think she won by 6 or 7 points, which if I were her, I would feel really good about. And just maybe giving her a little bit of breathing room going into, you know, reelection in two years, which that all starts back up really quickly after an election cycle. So one was definitely top of my mind. You know, Zach Nunn in Iowa, he’s newer I think this was his first term in Congress but we were a little worried that he was going to lose, but he prevailed. But then as Sadie mentioned, you know, Marianne Miller-Meeks who’s in her second term from Iowa, that race is still too close to call. So those are a few that come to my mind. Sadie Knight Yeah. And I'll add in a few here too. Like we were really happy to see Don Bacon pull out. He's in Nebraska's second district. But then outside of the Corn Belt, we were really happy to see Dan Newhouse, they called his race last night. He's the head of the Western caucus and has been a great ally and friend to the corn industry and to ag in general. Happy to see him pull out. And also Don Davis over in North Carolina. He is the vice ranking member on the House Ag Committee, and he's just been a super great member to work with. He's been very open to production ag issues along with food issues and all that kind of get swept into the ag committee. So we're happy to see those folks outside of the Corn Belt make their way back to Congress in January. As for freshmen members, I like to leave first impressions to the first 100 days, and if we talk again in 100 days, I might have some better opinions for you on who we’re excited about. Dusty Weis Well, I'll look forward to that conversation, certainly it'll be a good one to have. But broadening out the conversation a little bit now from the House of Representatives to the balance of power in Washington, certainly it's safe to say that there has been a shift here from divided government to what looks like it's going to be Republican control of the presidency, the House, and the Senate. And with that shift in power, of course, comes the new process of trying to determine who is going to head those particular institutions. So as we move from the election cycle to now determining the leadership roles of the various chambers and the committee assignments that go with them, what are we watching here? What's of note? Brooke Appleton So both the Senate Republicans and the House Republicans are holding their leadership elections here today. The Senate has actually already completed theirs and Senator John Thune from South Dakota has been named the new Republican leader of the Senate. South Dakota, obviously a big agriculture state. We grow a lot of corn in South Dakota. Poet, who is the largest ethanol producer in the world, is headquartered in South Dakota. So we feel pretty good about John Thune being the head of the Republican conference in the Senate. The House is also holding their leadership elections today, and we really don't anticipate much change there. We expect Mike Johnson to still be the speaker, the nominee, to be the speaker. Keep in mind, the leader of the Senate and the leader of the House have to be voted on a floor vote once the new Congress starts on January 3rd. But we anticipate Mike Johnson to be the nominee. And Steve Scalise to continue to be the majority leader. Both of those members are from Louisiana. And then Congressman Emmer from Minnesota will be in that third spot in the majority whip spot on the House. Now the fourth spot, the conference chair slot over on the House side, now that is probably going to be vacated by Elise Stefanik, who's a member from New York. President elect Trump has nominated her to be his UN ambassador to the United States. So that will be the only probably difference in the top four on the House side. And then we'll expect that to be the leadership for the incoming Congress. Dusty Weis Now, this last congressional term was memorable for a lot of reasons, but one thing that sticks out to me was those several weeks in the fall of 2023, when House Republicans had the majority, but because the majority was so slim, it made it difficult for them to select a leader. Indications are that their majority might be even slimmer this term perhaps, we're still waiting to see, but do we anticipate any more such leadership drama? Brooke Appleton You know, I think I mean, for the most part, from what I can tell now, I mean, a lot can happen between now and January 3rd. I think the House leadership is probably pretty set. What's interesting is, though, is that margin is going to be tight. And, you know, Sadie said earlier, we're not even sure what the number is yet. I don't they haven't gotten to 218 yet. We already have three different House members that have been tapped by the incoming president to be in his administration, so they're dwindling away at their assumed majority before it's even set. And so, yeah, that number is going to be close. They're going to have a couple vote probably margin and there will be infighting within the caucus that will still cause, you know, some disruption. But I feel like the leadership spots are probably pretty safe depending on what could happen. And, you know, the incoming president, Donald Trump, he's going to be influential there, right? I think they're all going to want to stay in his good graces, because he has a very loud voice and a very big stage. Dusty Weis Well, let's shift our focus to the top of the ticket then, because the elephant in the room here is Donald Trump. We're getting a new president, but we're also getting an entirely new cabinet of leaders that are going to carry out the White House's priorities and vision for the next four years. Who or what should we be watching? You already mentioned the House representative from New York that President Trump has appointed as his UN ambassador, but who else should we be watching as president-elect Trump makes selections for his inner circle? Brooke Appleton Yeah, we have a list of kind of key positions that we're obviously interested in that we work with quite frequently. We're not speculating publicly on who those people might be. But, you know, as those come into place, you know, we're going to be doing our own evaluation about their record if they have one, how we think they might be on our issues moving forward. And then, of course, you know, they all are subject to the confirmation process in the Senate, which can be lengthy. So we'll be prepared whenever it gets to that point. But, you know, at USDA, obviously we have our eyes on who the secretary is going to be, who the deputy secretary is going to be. And then a couple of the undersecretaries that we work with most closely, you know, the Trade and Foreign Ag Service undersecretary and then the one for the Farm Production and Conservation, or the FPAC, as we all affectionately call it now. So we'll have our eyes on those and a number of other positions across all the departments. And then there's some non-confirmed ones to that, of course, are important as well, but those will trickle in later. Obviously you kind of get the top of the pyramid first, and then everyone kind of fills in behind. Dusty Weis NCGA came into this election with its eyes on a number of issues. The Farm Bill, Free Trade, Next Generation Fuels Act, growing new markets for corn, just to name a few. There's a lot. But what is the new political landscape look like for some of these issues, and how are you approaching them headed into 2025? Brooke Appleton Yeah, I mean, I think the issue probably most top of mind for folks is trade. It's one of our biggest demand drivers that we have. I think there will be both opportunities and challenges with the incoming Trump administration on trade policy. We've heard him talk in the press about tariffs and using tariffs as leverage or as a way to boost domestic industries, but we also know that that can have a negative effect on agriculture and most likely the economy. So we're excited, again, we know there will be opportunity and challenges. But, you know, we've really tried to focus on designing a proactive approach on trade and really all the issues that we care about that will hopefully resonate with the new administration and kind of give them some positive things to work on as we move into next year. Again, I think we'll approach all of the issue sets, but I know trade is really top of mind. I know that just with the talk of tariffs throughout the campaign and kind of what happened when Trump was president previously and what we saw with the 2018 trade war. And, you know, as he put tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as a wide range of imported products from China, in response, China and other nations imposed retaliatory tariffs on the US products and that obviously targeting agriculture commodities. So we've seen that before. And so we're just trying to think how we can focus on some more positive, proactive market access items that we can also work on. Dusty Weis It's definitely, it's one of those things where the work is certainly not done. And I would imagine those strategies are still being formulated as we move forward here. But that'll be a big job that we approach in 2025. Brooke Appleton Yeah. And I think one of the biggest differences, I mean, we have a bit of a different economic landscape right now that we really are going to need to press upon this new administration. Corn prices are low and inputs are high, and tariffs would only compound this issue. The second point is Brazil and Argentina are ready to swoop in and claim market share. They were not as big of a competitor back in 2018, but they definitely are now. And then lastly, just pointing out, you know, we really don't have a place to put corn or beans for that matter, should markets like Mexico or China be shut off. There's no market equivalent to the volume of those two, and there are not prospective trade agreements that would unlock the size of new markets. So, you know, I think just talking through some of those things early on and sending those messages early on will be really important. Dusty Weis Lest we get the cart before the horse here, it's important to note that the current term of Congress is going to be back in Washington. They'll be in session for five weeks before the end of the year. They call this the “lame duck” session because lawmakers go into it with the new balance of power hanging over their heads. But as we look ahead to these five weeks being in session here, is there anything that we anticipate getting done or any action that we're hoping to see on some of our priorities there? Brooke Appleton So we definitely have priorities going into the lame duck, and I'm happy to speak to those. But I feel pretty strongly that the president-elect is going to have a lot of influence here at the end of the year. And if he says yes, then it happens. And if he says no, then it probably doesn't. So as leadership elections wrap up today, I'm assuming that they will start mapping out what the next 4 or 5 session weeks will look like before we get towards that end of the year, which I think they're set to adjourn on the 20th of December. But he's going to play a role. And that's all going to kind of play out before our eyes in the next week, I would say. But for us, you know, there's definitely some things that we would love to see done at the end of the year. We have been working on a nationwide year-round E15 fix for the better part of a decade, if not more, and that is something we would just love to see happen here at the end of the year, there is a compromise bill that has been introduced in the Senate and House, and we've got sponsors on both sides. We've got a lot of support, and we're really hoping that if there is an appetite to include that at the end of the year, that if there's a window, man, we're going to jump through it. The other piece of it, of course, Congress is working on getting a farm bill done, a full five year farm bill. We're not there yet. We've only really seen one version of that bill come out of the House Ag Committee. The Senate has yet to produce any text to kind of counter what the House did. So we're not really sure how that's going to shake out. But there's going to be a lot of discussion in the coming weeks or so. Can they get a full five year bill done before the end of the year, or does this turn into another extension into next year? But then there's also, because of kind of what has happened across the board with low prices and high inputs, as I already mentioned, you know, just the need for pure economic assistance for farmers across the country. And that has really risen to the top of the list for a lot of groups. And I know we're part of this discussions as well. So there's going to be a lot of that talk here at the end of the year, too. And that's a priority for us as well. Dusty Weis You know, this is a time of the year, particularly after an election, but in any year, where you kind of start to look back at the year that's gone by on the calendar and try to take away lessons from it, try to parse some things that you can use in the year going forward here. And so you two are just a couple of the many, many experts that NCGA has working on its behalf in Washington, you're our experts in Washington. As you look back at the 2024 election, everything that led up to it, is there anything that surprised you about the past year and the way that things have shaken out here? Sadie Knight I hate to use the word, but like unprecedented. I mean, when I mean, I may be wrong, but when in our lifetime has a presidential nominee stepped aside for someone in their inner circle to- Dusty Weis And sort of coronated almost. And paved the way for, yeah. Sadie Knight Yeah, it's pretty jarring. Brooke Appleton Like less than a month away from their convention. Dusty Weis And with 100 days and change leading up to the election itself. Sadie Knight Yes. And then again, like, same nominee raised more than $1 billion and she still didn't win. Like I think there's going to be a whole new conversation about campaign fundraising and winning elections and how money is used and resourced and allocated. I really think that this election cycle is really going to reshape how campaign strategists and political strategists approach elections. I think it's going to set a new precedent. Brooke Appleton I mean, I will say, and we've had a lot of conversations around our table here. And, you know, there's 11 of us here in the D.C. office, and we don't all have the same, you know, personal politics, right? So we got a lot of opinions and a lot of things that people were pointing out and stuff. And I think what everyone agreed with is that you knew exactly what Donald Trump was running on, you knew what his three issues were. And you couldn't necessarily say that for Kamala Harris. And it changed from week to week a little bit. Right? I think that's kind of what we distilled it down to in, you know, the 11 people that sit in this office. So I think he was very clear about what he was for. And it resonated, obviously. I mean, there hasn't been a Republican who's won the popular vote since. . . Dusty Weis I think George Bush in 2004. Brooke and Sadie 2004. Okay. So 20 years. Dusty Weis Has it been 20 years? Oh my gosh. Brooke Appleton Yeah, yeah. So anyway, I think we've all, anyone who works in politics and even if you don't, I think we've all been reflecting on what we saw and maybe what is changing a little bit or not. But I kind of feel like since I've been in Washington almost 20 years, and I feel like it's been unprecedented since the day I got here, I'm kind of, you know, I'm kind of like, ready for some just basic, normal stuff. Dusty Weis But what even is basic and normal in 2024? But I guess we'll find out in 2025. And that's what makes the job super interesting. But I'll say this if I had a nickel for every time that I had heard the word “uncertainty” on the news over the last year, or in a discussion, I wouldn't need to still be making podcasts for a living. I probably still would. But with that much said, these election results do give us some indication of what's to come in the term ahead. So what can we feel more certain about, would you say, going into 2025? Sadie Knight I think that one piece of certainty is that Americans are really being affected by and their opinions are being affected by inflation and the economy. Those kitchen table issues, those kitchen table topics still reign, for lack of a better term, in the political arena. People are maybe more introspective about the debt they are in and their future and their family's future. And I think that the folks that voted, voted with those type of issues in mind. Brooke Appleton And I think, too, I mean, I'll caveat that with, I don't know that “certainty” is a word I would use for any of it here. I mean, yes, we saw a Republican sweep, we kind of know who the players are, who they're going to be as far as Congress goes and the administration will start coming together. But I think we saw this movie in 2016, 2017, when the first Trump administration started. Republicans also controlled Congress, but the midterm was pretty messy for them. So there's going to be a lot of pressure on these first two years. And, you know, the infighting I'm sure has already begun. I mean, I can't imagine they're all on the same page. They're all coming at it from their perspective and their respective districts. So I don't know if the word “certainty” is one I would use at all, especially in this line of work. Dusty Weis Yeah, yeah. So buckle your seatbelts seems to be the takeaway therent, but one thing that I did want to note that was really interesting to me is that just as president elect Trump did four years ago, he drew more strength from rural areas than his Democratic opponent did. According to the Associated Press’s Votecast, which examines exit polling, nearly half of voters, 45%, say that they live in the suburbs. About half of those voters went for Harris, 46% chose Trump. In rural areas, Trump won about 6 in 10 voters, 60% of folks in small towns in rural communities, while Harris won about 6 in 10, 60% of urban voters. What does this say about the power of the rural vote? Brooke Appleton I think it's so interesting because I do think that people kind of like to ignore the “flyover states,” if you will, or the middle of the country. I mean, I've lived in Washington now almost 20 years. I meet a lot of people, I say I'm from Missouri, and they kind of look at me like, “Okay, Missouri, Saint Louis?” And I'm like, that's in the state. But I'm from the other parts of the state. You know, there's a lot of that. And I will say too, leading up to the election, I would be in conversations and people would be like, “There’s no way Kamala Harris could lose. There's just no way.” And I look at them and I say, “Have you left the Beltway in the last two weeks?” And the answer was usually no. And you spend any amount of time 60 miles outside of DC and it's a different story. And so I think we all kind of live in our own bubbles in some ways, right? Sadie and I have the luxury of being from rural America, understanding it. You know, and still going there multiple times a year. So we have a bit of a different perspective for sure. Sadie Knight Yeah. And I would say too, I don't come from a particularly politically charged family, which is shocking because I work in DC now. But my mom voted the first time I ever voted in a presidential election, and so not a hugely politically charged family. And I had a conversation with a family member a few weeks ago, and they didn't completely understand the dynamics between the Electoral College and the popular vote, which albeit is incredibly confusing. And so we walked through and like had the conversation and they just asked me flat out, they're like, “Does my vote even matter?” And I had to kind of walk through with them why the Electoral College was set and how it balances out that kind of urban/rural balance of power and the vote power there, and reiterated to them, like how important it is to show up on November 5th or cast an early vote. And as we can see in this election, the popular vote in the electoral vote said the same thing and kind of gave some double confirmation of how incredibly important it is to show up and vote. And so I guess, like my response to that is, don't let the city folks get you down. Just because there's a higher population concentration in some areas doesn't mean that your vote is lesser or your voice is lesser. It's the beauty of how we set up our democracy. Dusty Weis 100%. And I've got to say, it has been really, really interesting getting to pick both of your brains here. I've certainly learned a lot today. It's informed my expectations for the year ahead and I imagine a lot of people are going to find it really useful. But one thing that you can count on, one thing, Brooke, that we can be certain about is that come what may, no matter who's in power, our mission remains the same. And it's to help growers economically by expanding market demand through addressing trade barriers and exploring the new opportunities that are out there. And folks can be certain that that work will continue. So we appreciate your taking the time to catch us up on all the latest.

    "content": "National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman Jr., released the following statement today to congratulate President-Elect Donald J. Trump following Tuesday’s election: “On behalf of corn growers across the country, I want to congratulate President-Elect Donald J. Trump on his victory in Tuesday’s election. We look forward to working with the new administration and members of Congress to advance policy that is important to corn farmers. We especially appreciate President Trump’s recognition that homegrown fuels, like ethanol, are important for our nation’s energy security and rural economies. We are also eager to work with his administration and Congress to enact improved farm policies and programs, expand market opportunities and build on the tax policies enacted during President Trump’s first term that are beneficial to corn farmers as they face a challenging financial outlook with low prices and high costs.”",

    "title": "EP. 49 - Going All-Out to Grow Corn Demand, with NCGA President Ken Hartman and Chairman Harold Wolle",
    "content": "The NCGA is working nonstop to find relief for growers. Caught between rising costs and stagnant corn prices, growers are feeling the pinch. So, as the National Corn Growers Association transitions from the leadership of one member-President to another, its leadership and staff are focused on growing demand for corn in both the short- and long-term horizons. In this episode, we meet newly-minted President Ken Hartman, Jr., a grower from southern Illinois who is taking the reins as NCGA's top leader. And we also meet his predecessor, former President Harold Wolle from south-central Minnesota, who's stepping into the role of NCGA chairman. Together, they'll discuss the top priorities for NCGA in the year ahead, how the organization is driving new sources of demand for corn, and why it's more important than ever to be in touch with your representatives in Washington.

It is education about what a good fuel ethanol is, how it can decarbonize the transportation system right now. Ken Hartman The next step is get these higher blends of ethanol and work on trade agreements. There are a lot of things the National Corn Growers are just working on that I don’t think everybody realizes… Dusty Weis Hello and welcome to the Cobcast: Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you're following the show on your favorite podcast app and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at NCGA.com. I'm Dusty Weis, and today we are joined by a couple of the member growers who lead the National Corn Growers Association. We're going to get to know a little bit more about them, from their perspectives on the state of the farm economy to the market opportunities that they see on the horizon, and will also take a look at where the association's work is focused at this moment in time and in the future here. So first, we have your NCGA President, Kenneth Hartman, Jr. Ken, welcome to the show. Could you tell us a little bit about you and your farm? Ken Hartman Thank you. I'm excited about being here today. Well, I'm Kenneth Hartman Jr, live in Waterloo, Illinois, right south about 25 miles of Saint Louis in southern Illinois. We have a corn, beans and wheat to grain farm. I’m a fifth generation farmer, been here for many, many years. But right now we're just grain farming. I'm here farming with my wife and my mother who still helps do some of the books. And then my daughter, who's right now running combine right now because we're still in harvest. I have three daughters here, the other two have jobs off the farm, but, still involved somewhat with agriculture. And just excited about being here today. Dusty Weis Yeah. Excited to have you, and always, always an adventure operating multi-generational farm like that. But really, I think at the end of the day and I'm sure that you agree, it's part of what makes it so rewarding. Certainly someone who I think is going to agree with that sentiment is NCGA Chairman, former outgoing president of the National Corn Growers Association, Harold Wolle. Harold, want to get to know you a little bit more as well and learn about your operation up there in Minnesota. Harold Wolle Certainly, Dusty. We farm in south central Minnesota growing corn and soybeans. You know, the farm has transitioned over my career. Started out we had hogs and cattle on the farm. I have transitioned to corn and soybeans. I also have transitioned the farming operation to my son, Matthew. He is the sixth generation farmer. So, you know, great, great, great grandpa, purchased the first farm from the railroad back in 1883. So, just a little over 140 years that that farm has been in our family. Very proud of that. That's one of the factors for sustainable farms, I think is longevity on the land. Excited to be here as well today. Dusty Weis Six generations on the farm, that's just incredible. And at that point, it's not just an occupation. It's a way of life. And that's what makes it so special, what we do here. And honestly, at the end of the day, that's what we're all working to preserve, is that ability for families to continue to have these multi-generational opportunities. For both of you probably it's a big part of why you got involved in NCGA leadership as well is to go out and leave the industry better than you found it, leave it in good shape for the next generation. So as you think about the next decade or so, what are some of the biggest things that need to change so that that next generation of growers, your son Harold and your daughters Ken can be successful at what they do? Ken Hartman Well, I think the big thing we need to do is right now we have issues right now with corn prices being low, we need to work on creating demand. It's a big push to create demand. Some of the areas, obviously, is foreign markets, you know, 15% of our grain goes to exports. So that's a big piece of the pie as I would look at this. We also need to take full advantage of all the other ways that corn is being used. You know, ethanol is huge right now. That's a big part of our market. And then also working on new uses and obviously working with the cattle industry. But, you know, when you think about ethanol is used for cars and now we're even talking about using for jets, basically anything that's made from a petroleum product can actually be made from corn, and it's environmentally friendly. Harold Wolle Absolutely demand is center focus. You know, we need to balance our production with the demand for our products. If we're going to have a price that allows us to be sustainable. And one of those areas is trade, as Kenny mentioned, you know, free trade agreements work, there's no doubt about it. And we have not had a new free trade agreement negotiated in quite some time. I know there's a few that are being negotiated now, you know, a free trade agreement with Kenya and with the United Kingdom. So there's a potential here. And we need to realize the potential of those trade agreements. So a lot of work needs to be done there. They're very complicated. But a rules-based system of trade is very important as we move forward. Dusty Weis You know, we had a conversation a couple of months back with our advocacy team. And one of the things that they drove home, and I certainly think it's worth talking about with just a few days to go until the election here, is the fact that there's no better time to get in your politician's ears than when they're asking to have their job back. This is a great time to reach out to your local elected officials and your national elected officials, and let them know that you think that international trade needs to be a priority here, and that we need to focus on building demand for that corn. How have you two been active in that process here in your role with the NCGA? Ken Hartman Well, we've been very, very active, you know, talking to our politicians, talking to the Biden administration about how important trade agreements are. And obviously, we're looking at, going to have a new administration here on either side. We don't know what that's going to happen yet, but we're bipartisan organization. So we want to keep pushing and explaining to them how important trade agreements are, and how important trade is for us. You know, some of the things we've also worked on is import tariffs we're concerned with. There's been some issues with import tariffs coming in with fertilizer and chemicals and right now with the way corn prices are and agriculture is in kind of a low, low area, we need to keep those input costs low. So whatever we can we need to keep that going. Obviously the other things we've been working on is we partnership with the U.S. Grains Council. They’re our arm when it comes to working overseas with exports, but they're not the lobbying organization. We're the ones that lobby for trade agreements. We're the ones that basically have to be in DC to work on getting some of this done, especially when it comes to, you know, we're trying to get a farm bill. Which one of our priorities that farm bill is MAP and FMD. That's market access programs and market development programs. So we're looking at that, doubling that in that farm bill. So that's very important. And there's just a lot of things that National Corn Growers has been working on, on the fronts of, of exporting corn and also on the fronts of exporting DDGs and ethanol. Dusty Weis Harold, you've been taking point on this for a while now, trying to get this message out to the people that need to hear it. What's working, what's not, what's been frustrating, what's been rewarding? Harold Wolle Well, you know, I think, Dusty, you hit the nail on the head when you advised us to contact our leaders during this pre-election period. And I just wanted to comment that I was able to have my senator, Amy Klobuchar, come out to the farm and ride around in the combine with me. So it was an excellent opportunity to have a discussion about a variety of farm policy issues, including trade and ethanol and the demand for corn with her. You know, she is, in line to, depending upon who has the majority in the Senate, either be the chair or woman of the Senate ag committee or the ranking member. So, you know, a lot depends on the election this fall as to who the important folks are going to be that can help us achieve our policy objectives. What's working? Well, you know, our U.S. Trade Representative's office is very important for corn growers as we talk about trade. And we've developed a relationship with the chief ag negotiator, Doug McKalip. He came to one of our conferences and spoke and answered questions and I had a very good discussion with him so that he realizes the importance of trade to corn farmers. I think that's very important as well. And I don't know that everyone knows the extent that the US Trade Representative's office works for our nation in developing trade throughout the world. So, I'm glad we had the opportunity to visit with Doug a couple different times. And he certainly is an important person for us. Dusty Weis Well, now, Harold, I want to hear a little bit more about Senator Klobuchar’s visit, because, first and foremost, six generations in business out there in Minnesota, is that the first time that a U.S. senator stepped foot on your soil? Harold Wolle Well, my other, U.S. senator is Senator Tina Smith, and she was lieutenant governor before she was Senator. And when she was lieutenant governor, she came out to the farm for a visit. And I got to give her a combine ride as well. And those combine rides are so special because it's just you and the senator in the combine, and you get to discuss things on a personal level. And I think that when you build relationships like that, it gives you then the opportunity to interact in the future out in D.C. on a very effective basis. And I know Kenny has established many relationships with his elected officials as well. Dusty Weis Well, it's not just, an opportunity to get in their ear and tell them what's on your mind, although that's certainly important. It's an opportunity to get to know them as a human being, and it's an opportunity for them to get to know you and your family as a human being as well. How did you go about setting that up? Did you just call the office, or do you have a little bit of help from staff on that? How did we make that happen? Harold Wolle I think it evolved from I gave Senator Klobuchar the president's award when I was president of NCGA and was able to present that to her at Minnesota's Farm Fest. And that just was the beginning of or an acceleration of the relationship that she and I have. And her staff members wanted to get her out to a farm. She visits all 87 counties in Minnesota every year, and so a farm visit was very appropriate for her in this election cycle. And I and my family were very glad to host her. Dusty Weis Oh, I bet the family got a kick out of it. Harold Wolle They did. You know, we have a picture in the farmyard of the family and Senator Klobuchar, and that is going to live in our family for a long time. Dusty Weis Ken I want your opinion on this, too. When a Senator comes and visits, do you wear the muck boots or do you get out the wingtips? Ken Hartman (laughs) Well, I've had a few, I know different congressmen come to the house over the years, and we definitely have gave tours, walked around the round the buildings and explained where things are and just kind of be real the way the farm operation goes. And, and I think, as Harold says, it's very important to educate them as far as what's really going on down on the farm and make them understand what we're doing, especially when it comes down to the sustainability side. I know a lot of conservation we do sustainability and the new technologies that we're working with right now, I don't think a lot of them understand what the farm is compared to what it maybe was 10, 20 years ago. Dusty Weis No, that's just it. I was out in D.C. in May for the Celebration of Agriculture on the National Mall, and that was a big part of the mission that we had out there was to just get people to understand that farming doesn't look like farming looked like 30, 20, even five years ago. There's a lot more technology, there's a lot more computers, there's a lot more cutting-edge stuff that goes into it. And we just, we need folks to understand that. But I do want to switch gears a little bit here. And because we're on the topic of demand generation, because that's so important for the future of farming right now, I wanted to talk about the ethanol market, what do growers need to know about the ethanol market right now? Ken Hartman Ethanol is very important to the corn growers organizations and the farmers out here in the area as a one of our major markets. Basically, we've got E15 right now is one of our top priorities to get passed year round. There's a bill in the House and the Senate side for E15. We also are working on what they call the Next Generation Fuel Act. This is a bill that we support and sponsored in the House and Senate side. And if we could get this passed, this would be huge because this would get us to higher blends of ethanol, 20/25 percent. This would create a certification fuel for basically the higher blends of ethanol. So the auto industry could start building engines that were designed for higher blends of ethanol. It would also go through the process of getting E85 credits again, like it was a few years ago. And we're really hoping to get this passed in the future. We feel like this would be great to be ethanol. We want a level playing field with some of the other forms of energy, and we think this would be great. You know, if you go right now down to Brazil, they're running 27% ethanol in their vehicles and they're going to 30. And there's no reason that we couldn't do the same thing. I mean, it's environmentally friendly. It's basically a cheaper product right now than regular gasoline. And we've got plenty of corn right now. So it's good for the producer, it's good for the environmentalists, and it's good for the consumer. Dusty Weis Ken you know, I know that ethanol has had a huge impact down across central Illinois, across Iowa, across a lot of Missouri, even where I grew up in south central Wisconsin, a little town called Monroe. About 20 years ago, they opened up an ethanol plant that came in to process corn and turn it into ethanol. And that was some of the first new industrial construction that we'd seen in Monroe in decades at that point, as far as I can remember. It's a big deal for rural economies. Harold, I know this is something that you've been working on as well. What are we doing to get our message out about ethanol? Harold Wolle Well, it's a never-ending job. It is education. It's providing information about what a good fuel ethanol is, how it can decarbonize the transportation system right now. You know, and it is a popular fuel in Minnesota. We are so fortunate, we have a lot of retailers that are marketing unleaded 88, which is e-15 and consumers like it because like Kenny said, it's lower priced, it burns cleaner. And I like to tell folks, you know, in our effort to decarbonize the transportation system, we know how to grow corn. We know how to store corn. We know we've already got our bio refineries that convert corn into ethanol. The system’s in place, versus some of the necessary infrastructure that we need in order to have electric vehicles operate properly. There's a tremendous amount of infrastructure that needs to be put in place. So I think, you know, we need to burn higher blends of ethanol right now in order to decarbonize our liquid fuels, our transportation system. Dusty Weis You know, it's funny, we talk about ethanol and it still feels new to me, even though it's not. Again, it's been on the rise, up and coming for a while now. But we did mention earlier that there are some new uses for corn that are being talked about as well. Some stuff that really, truly is cutting edge right now. What are those and how are we building out those opportunities? Ken Hartman Well, one of the big new uses, I think that we that you're talking about is sustainable aviation fuel. I mean, that's a huge opportunity. We're talking, you know, a 50 billion gallon market right now. And, you know, one of the ways that you make sustainable aviation fuel is ethanol to jet. A lot of these ethanol plants, I know there's certain companies that are starting to look at converting them from just ethanol to sustainable aviation fuel. I know I had, I just had a woman from Boeing came to the farm here this fall, and we were talking about how Boeing is really excited about basically using corn for sustainable aviation fuel, because they're looking at the environmental sustainability side. They're looking for, you know, working on, you know, the lower CI scores, which we're doing when it comes to the no-till, the cover crops, the different technologies that have came about, they're really excited. In fact, her comment was that right now, from what I understand, you can basically it's a 50% with current fuels we're doing. But she says down the pipeline, down the road, it could be 100%. And it gets to that point, we're talking about a 100 billion gallon market. And so there's plenty of room for everybody for this market. Dusty Weis I mean, it just kind of makes sense when you think about it. I was talking about this the other week with my brother-in-law, who is an engineer and gets really excited about this kind of stuff, and he pointed out the fact that you never can make an airplane that is electric, because it turns out that lithium batteries are really, really heavy, and putting heavy things on airplanes is not a great way to build an airplane, it turns out. And so I think that there's a huge opportunity here going forward. What do you think, Harold? Harold Wolle Absolutely. A huge opportunity. We need to have everybody on board. You know, the consumers need to realize that there's a need to decarbonize that air transportation system as well. It's going to cost some more money. So it's going to be a combination of some tax credits. You know, the current administration has proposed some 45Z tax credits that would help the sustainable aviation fuel be more affordable. That's very important. We need to get the parameters around that tax credit identified and let farmers know so that they can meet the requirements to produce the corn that would qualify when it is converted to ethanol for a low carbon, sustainable aviation fuel. Dusty Weis You know, Harold, as we wind down here, you just handed off the baton to Ken after your term as president. We talked earlier about leaving the industry better than you found it. And as you look back, I want to give you a chance to brag on what you've done here because it's a hard job. You work real hard. You work real hard on the farm, and then you're spending half your time on the plane to and from DC here. So as you look back, what are some of the things that you're proudest of having accomplished as president of the Corn Growers? Harold Wolle Well, advocating for corn growers across the nation. You know, there are a number of policy issues, and we've been talking mostly about demand here, but there's a bunch of other issues in our arena as well. Endangered Species Act regulations comes to mind. The farm bill, you know, we've known for some time that that 2018 farm bill expired at the end of 2023. Here we are, into 2024, and we don't have a farm bill done yet. We're very hopeful that that's going to happen in this lame duck session. No guarantees there though, either. And I think, how the election plays out and who has control of the House and the Senate and of course, the presidency are all going to make a difference on what policy issues get through Congress in this lame duck session. But, a fully reauthorize farm, five year farm bill is something that we've been advocating for. I've certainly been a part of that. Proud to have worked on that. Dusty Weis We need something steady. We need something reliable. We need something that growers can count on because they're not just fixated on next year. They're fixated on the next decade. And I think that's probably one of the big takeaways that's always really impressed me about the Corn Growers Association is the fact that it's an organization that's not just hung up on next year, they're looking a generation ahead. So with that, when you get back to Minnesota after having been away on NCGA duties, what do you tell your neighbors about the experience? Harold, what do you want them to know about the work that we're doing out there? Harold Wolle Well, that it's important work and that it does make a difference to them and their operations. The issues that are in front of us that society looks at sustainability, reducing the carbon footprint of agriculture, these are important topics. And, I want all of the corn growers in Minnesota to know that I've been very committed to advocating for, on their behalf on a variety of issues, including the ones I just mentioned. Dusty Weis Ken, what about you? You've been working with Harold on NCGA leadership for a few years here now. Probably known each other a bit longer in that. What do you appreciate about his leadership and his stewardship now as you take the reins as president? Ken Hartman Well, Harold's done such a good job when it comes to advocacy. I know he's been in DC a lot. I know he's testified in front of Congress working on the farm bill and some of these areas. I mean, it's always a challenge, but you got to be strong. And Harold's been out there out front, you know, standing up for American agriculture and the corn growers and looking at National Corn Growers as very much of a grassroots organization. And I know Harold's really supported that and push that. And it gets frustrating sometimes because you work so hard like a farm bill, but at the same time it just takes time. It's just it's going up the ladder one rung at a time. And I know Harold's been doing that and done a great job at it, so I'm hoping that I can follow through and we can get some things done here. And I mean, it's just like Harold talks about right now. I mean, right now, you know, our lame duck issues is we need to get E15 year round throughout the whole United States. I know the eight states are going to have E15, but that doesn't help us in the east and the west coast and these other areas. And it's frustrating for me because I look at, you know, how environmentally friendly can we be with, I mean, ethanol is compared to any other product? You know, we keep talking about having a level playing field, get that E15 done and then you go back to the farm bill, I know we basically we've kicked the can down the road here for a year now. It's might get kicked down for another year. Dusty Weis Oh we haven't kicked it Ken. Ken Hartman Well they have kicked it down, our Washington, D.C. folks, yes I agree we need to put them on the spot and we need to get them to, to get this finished here because, you know, the economy has changed a lot from 2018 to today. And we need some of the priorities of National Corn Growers is the fact that, you know, crop insurance, when we've looked at the inflation factors we've dealt with, we need support for crop insurance at the higher levels. We need the MAP and FMD for exports. You need these programs that are in the farm bill just to help support us. That's what I'm hoping that them two projects here, I hope by the end of the year that we can get done. And I know Harold's still there working hard for us as chairman, and I'm going to do what I can as president. So I'm really excited about the next year and hopefully we can get some things done and hopefully the next step is get these higher blends of ethanol and work on trade agreements. And there are a lot of things that National Corn Growers are just working on that, that I don't think everybody realizes how many things we've done over the years. Dusty Weis Yeah, we tend to get caught up in the things that are frustrating, the things that seem stuck. We focus a lot on the to do list, but there's a lot of stuff that's gotten done as well, and we certainly started this conversation about the next generation and setting them up for success. And so, Ken, as you're talking to your daughters about the future of growing corn in this country, what do you say to give them hope? What do they have to feel good about, do you think? Ken Hartman Well, when you look at, I mean, I'm happy my daughter came back to the farm after college. We're looking at the technology that's coming forth with precision agriculture. I mean, the efficiency we're doing with fertilizer. A lot of the biotech products that we're using today. I mean, if you look at trend line yields are going up about two bushel a year. That's why we need the markets to do that, to basically sell that product so we keep that price up. So there's just a lot of positives on the farm too. We unfortunately we don't always look at them, but it's really you know it's happy to be a family farm and being at home with your family growing a crop. I mean every year you put it out, you're hoping you got to have a lot of faith and a lot of hope that we can get the right weather and get things so we can get a good crop at the end of the year. So, I mean, it's I say farmers, we sometimes seem to be pessimists, but at the same time, I think we got to be pretty much optimists. And when you look at what we do and we deal with the weather. So I'm looking forward to the next generations for not only my daughter and Harold’s son, but all our farmers out there and, you know, keep that family farm going. Dusty Weis There's nothing more optimistic than putting a seed in the dirt in the spring and saying, I hope this is corn come the fall, I got to tell you that. Harold, anything to add to that? Harold Wolle Well, I you know, I think I want to emphasize that corn is a tremendous plant. I think farmers one of the things they have going for them then is that every living thing wants to grow and reproduce, and that's certainly what corn does. And I like to think of each of those little corn plants out there as a mini solar collector. It's taking energy from the sun and converting it into starch and oil, everything that we can use in our daily lives. So whether it's feed, fuel, fiber, corn produces it and it does it naturally by absorbing sunlight. So I think that's one of the things that that our future generations of farmers are going to continue to have going for them. Dusty Weis It's the oldest form of solar energy that's out there. And, I got to tell you, I think you're right. I think the future is bright, fellas. Certainly because of the leadership and stewardship of folks like you and everybody that's come before, and the new generation of leaders that's lining up to steward NCGA into the next generation as well. So I wanted to thank you both for your service to the National Corn Growers Association. NCGA, of course, will continue to work to drive demand and protect profitability for corn growers across the U.S., but your stewardship of the organization has been and continues to be an important part of that process as well. So Ken Hartman, President of the NCGA from Waterloo, Illinois, and Harold Wolle, Chairman and former president of the NCGA from Madelia, Minnesota, thank you both so much for joining us here on the Cobcast. Harold Wolle My pleasure. Ken Hartman Thank you. Dusty Weis And thank you for listening.

    "title": "Analysis Shows Tariff-Induced Trade War Would Hurt U.S. Farmers",
    "content": "U.S. corn and soy farmers’ loss would be South America’s gain A new economic study paints a troubling picture of the potential results a renewed U.S.-China trade war could have on hundreds of thousands of farmers and rural communities, showing American-imposed tariffs would come at a steep cost to U.S. producers while benefiting Brazil and Argentina. The study, commissioned by the American Soybean Association and the National Corn Growers Association and conducted by the World Agricultural Economic and Environmental Services, shows a new trade war would result in an immediate drop in corn and soy exports to the tune of hundreds of millions of tons. As a result, Brazil and Argentina would claim the lost market share, which would be extremely difficult for American growers to reclaim in the future. “The study highlights the dangers that come with broad tariffs on imports,” said NCGA Lead Economist Krista Swanson. “While launching widespread tariffs may seem like an effective tool, they can boomerang and cause unintended consequences. Our first goal should be to avoid unnecessary harm.” ASA joined NCGA in cautioning against a trade war. ASA Chief Economist Scott Gerlt said, “The U.S. agriculture sector is going through a significant economic downturn. This work shows that a trade war would easily compound the adverse conditions that are placing financial stress on farmers. Even when a trade war officially ends, the loss of market share can be permanent.” The third-party study comes as U.S. lawmakers and officials from both political parties are increasingly looking at tariff-forward approaches as they work to address troubling Chinese trade practices. Researchers modeled several scenarios that could play out in a new U.S.-China trade war and found a consistent outcome: Severe drop in U.S. exports to China. If China cancels its current waiver (from the 2020 Phase I agreement) and reverts to tariffs already on the books, U.S. soybean exports to China would, according to the study, fall 14 to 16 million metric tons annually, an average decline of 51.8% from baseline levels expected for those years. U.S. corn exports to China would fall about 2.2 million metric tons annually, an average decline of 84.3% from the baseline expectation. Brazil and Argentina would benefit. Brazil and Argentina would increase exports and thus gain valuable global market share. Chinese tariffs on soybeans and corn from the U.S.—but not Brazil—would provide incentive for Brazilian farmers to expand production area even more rapidly than baseline growth. No place to turn. While it is possible to divert exports to other nations, the study found there is insufficient demand from the rest of the world to offset the major loss of soybean exports to China to support the farmgate value. The study found that trade war would lead to a steep drop in soy and corn prices, resulting in a ripple impact across the U.S., particularly in rural economies where farmers live, purchase inputs, use farm and personal services, and purchase household goods. Leaders at NCGA and ASA said they believe it is in America’s economic interests to maintain a trading relationship with China, even as both governments work through trade and other concerns. They also noted that they support thoughtful consideration of the impacts tariffs and tariff retaliation could have on U.S. farms and rural communities.",

    "content": "Harley Janssen, a farmer and leader with over 20 years of experience in agriculture, construction and off-road technology, has joined the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA). He will serve as the director of outputs and measurements, a newly created position at the organization. “We are thrilled that Harley will be putting his extensive experience to work for our farmers,” said Sean Arians, vice president of sustainable production & value chain engagement at NCGA. “The high caliber experience he brings to this issue will help NCGA take its sustainability work to new heights.” In his role, Janssen will translate and interpret production and sustainability data and help growers access new sustainability markets. For example, he will play a crucial role as NCGA helps farmers access tax credits that will allow them to sell into the aviation sector. “We want to make certain that existing private and public sustainability programs are as inclusive as possible when it comes to how they work with and assist corn growers,” Jannsen said. “This is an exciting new challenge for me, and I look forward to working with my colleagues and the grower community to build a sustainability program at NCGA that is second to none.” Janssen has led cross-functional teams of engineering, manufacturing, product management, customer support and customer success professionals. His first day at NCGA was on Monday, Oct. 7.",

    "content": "National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) President Kenneth Hartman Jr. today told Biden administration officials that farmers are living through difficult economic times, but the administration and Congress can help by removing barriers so growers can access expanding markets for U.S. corn. Hartman’s comments came during an event, called “Farmers and Ranchers in Action,” hosted this morning at the White House. “On behalf of my fellow corn growers, I spoke about the need to make it possible for producers to access tax credits for sustainable aviation fuels,” Hartman said. “The tax credit would help us expand the ethanol market, which is important to growers, while boosting the airline industry’s efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions.” The White House meeting comes as producers are faced with falling corn and other commodity prices. Hartman also touched on priorities that he hopes Congress will tackle and called on administration officials to help in any way they can with pending legislation, such as the farm bill. “While we’re almost out of time this year, Congress should pass a robust farm bill,” Hartman said. “I also think Congress can advance legislation that will allow consumers to access higher blends of ethanol. During my visit today, I asked that the president sign these pieces of legislation once they make it to his desk.”",

    "title": "Illinois Farmer, Kenneth Hartman Jr., Becomes President of the National Corn Growers Association",
    "content": "Kenneth Hartman Jr., a corn farmer from Waterloo, Ill., began his term this week as president of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA). During meetings with the media today, Hartman discussed the current economic challenges corn growers face and said he wanted to push for passage of a robust farm bill, expand markets and address tariffs that are being placed on ag supplies and passed on to farmers. He also talked about the need to extend consumer access to higher blends of ethanol. Key to accomplishing these goals, he said, is building relationships. “My theme as president is “Building Bridges,” Hartman said. “We need to build on our ties with existing allies while cultivating new relationships with other organizations inside and outside agriculture. We also need to continue to reach out to policymakers and other leaders who may not represent rural communities but who benefit indirectly from the work of farmers. I strongly believe that coalition building is one of the most effective ways to get things done.” Hartman, a fifth-generation farmer, operates his farm along with his wife Anita, mother Joann and daughter Amanda. Hartman has extensive experience in advocacy. He served on the NCGA board for six years in a variety of leadership roles, and he is a past president of the Illinois Corn Growers Association and past chairman of the Illinois Corn Marketing Board. He is also a member of the Illinois Leadership Council for Ag Education. In 2021, Hartman was honored by Prairie Farmer magazine with the Master Farmer award for his exceptional agricultural production skills as well as his commitment to family and service. Hartman takes the reins at NCGA as growers across the Corn Belt face rising input costs and lower commodity prices. To address the issue, Hartman said he will focus on several issues, including advancing ethanol legislation, working with U.S. officials to expand foreign markets and identifying new uses for corn. NCGA’s board elects a member of the board to serve as president each year. The term begins in early October, the start of NCGA’s fiscal year. Harold Wolle, the organization’s immediate past president who hails from Minnesota, will now serve as chairman of the board.

    "title": "Growers Applaud Move by U.S. House Members to Expand Ethanol Access",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) applauded a bipartisan group of members of the U.S. House for introducing the “Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act” today, providing consumers with year-round access to higher blends of ethanol. “This legislation would remove needless limits on the sale of ethanol, particularly during the summer months, helping us further reduce greenhouse gas emissions, cut prices at the pump while helping corn growers by providing a steady market for ethanol.” said Minnesota corn grower and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “The members of Congress introducing and co-sponsoring this legislation clearly care deeply about the economic wellbeing of farmers and rural America.” Reps. Adrian Smith (R-Neb.), Angie Craig (D-Minn.), Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.), and Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa) are sponsoring the legislation. Under current federal policy, 15% blends of ethanol, often called E15, cannot be sold at terminals during the summer months. But the Clean Air Act gives EPA authority to temporarily waive these requirements to address pressing concerns, such as fuel shortages. The policy has left corn growers who rely on the sale of ethanol with a great deal of uncertainty. Drivers have also been faced with higher gas prices during the summer vacation season. The Biden administration has issued waivers over the last few years. But growers and many Midwest governors have called for a permanent fix to the problem. Today’s legislation would offer that solution. Similar legislation, introduced by Sens. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill), Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), has been pending in the Senate. Corn grower leaders have also supported that legislation. \"Our champions in both chambers of Congress have sponsored and co-sponsored sound and sensible legislation that will remove a major market barrier, for us” Wolle said. “Now we call on their colleagues and the president to do what it takes to ensure this legislation becomes law.”",

    "title": "EP. 48 - EPA's New Approach to Pesticide Registrations: Farmers Should Get Informed and Get Ready",
    "content": "Herbicides, insecticides and fungicides make up some of the most important tools in a farmer’s toolbox. And it’s up to each one of us to take seriously the responsibilities of being a good steward for those tools, and the environment around us. But recently, the process by which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates pesticides has been challenged in court, on the grounds that it didn’t comply with parts of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). And so EPA has to build a plan to prove it’s in compliance with the ESA, causing potential disruptions for growers. In this episode, we’re examining how we got here, what changes growers should expect, how farmers should get prepared, and how groups like the National Corn Growers Association are working with the EPA and other environmental services to minimize the impact on farming operations. Our expert guests include: Megan Dwyer, the Director of Conservation and Nutrient Stewardship for Illinois Corn Stanley Culpepper, an Extension Weed Scientist with the University of Georgia Bill Belzer, the Global Stewardship Director at Corteva This episode is sponsored by Corteva Agriscience. https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ncga?selected=PDM1812895342 TRANSCRIPT: Dusty Weis Hello, and welcome to the CobCast, Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn… for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the D.C. Beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America… have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you’re following this show in your favorite podcast app, and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at NCGA.com. I’m Dusty Weis, and today we’re getting down to the brass tacks of a plan that the Environmental Protection Agency has had in the works… to prove they’re complying with the Endangered Species Act when they review and approve crop protection products for use in agriculture. As this plan makes its way into the countryside, it will change how farmers can use herbicides, insecticides and fungicides. In this episode, we’ll look at how we got here, what changes farmers can expect, and how groups like NCGA are engaging with EPA as they put the plan into action. Here to break it all down for us are Megan Dwyer and Stanley Culpepper who have both followed this issue closely as it's developed over more than a year now. First of all, Megan Dwyer is the director of conservation and nutrient stewardship for Illinois Corn. Megan, welcome to the show. Megan Dwyer Thanks for having me. Looking forward to this great conversation. And it's awesome that we've got Stanley to join us in this today. Dusty Weis Absolutely, a ton of expertise, very highly recommended here. Stanley Culpepper, of course, an extension weed scientist with the University of Georgia. Stanley, welcome. Stanley Culpepper Thank you so much. Again, similar, it's a pleasure to be here with you guys. Dusty Weis And we'd be remiss if we didn't point out as well that this episode is brought to you by Corteva Agriscience. A little later in the episode, we're going to hear a bit more from our partners at Corteva on stewardship and what farmers can do now to help keep crop protection products effective for the long term. But Megan and Stanley, thank you both for joining us today. Before we get into the details of this plan and what it's going to mean going forward, I think it's worth taking a step back and looking at where this issue came from. How did we get here? How’d it get started, Stanley? Stanley Culpepper Yeah, so Dusty, you really got to go back, believe it or not, to 1973. In 1973, Congress basically put into act the Endangered Species Act. At that time, it was actually to provide framework to conserve and protect endangered and threatened species in their habitats. And I think all of us in agriculture think, wow, that sounds pretty good. We're supportive. You know, the habitat and the lands that we grow our crops on and we live on, you know, we want to protect those. But I think what was not expected that’s really come to light in the last really three or four years is how that act influences the registration of new compounds or new pesticides that we need in our toolbox, as well as the re-registration process, those older tools. As a weed scientist, we work a lot with older tools, right? So we go through the re-registration process. But when that federal action of registering a product occurs, basically when the endangered or threatened species are potentially harmed by a pesticide, the law requires consultation with the services. And unfortunately, since the Endangered Species Act has been in place, the EPA really never consulted with the services when they registered or re-registered a pesticide. And what that has ultimately done to us in the last couple of years is it's put us in a very difficult situation with court cases or lawsuits where essentially we haven't followed the guidelines or the laws when registering or re-registering a product. And it makes us vulnerable to losing these tools, completely taking them out of our toolbox. And as you know, all of our growers need every tool that we've got plus additional options. Dusty Weis Yeah. And registration of herbicides, of pesticides is something that most growers are probably familiar with, but can we like take a step back and sort of explain how that process works as well? Essentially a manufacturer comes forward and they say, this is a tool and this is a prescription for how we think this tool could be used. And then it's reviewed by the EPA. Then that goes onto the label for the product. And essentially that determines what is a legal use for the product. Is that an oversimplification? Is that how that works? Stanley Culpepper No, I think you've got it. think the other important thing that most people don't realize and the latest numbers I've seen is it takes on average about 12 years and $300 million to bring a new tool to the toolbox. So the amount of research that goes into it as far as we think a lot about efficacy, control on a pest, but as far as safety to the applicator, safety to the environment, safety to the consumer. The amount of resources and effort that go into that before a product ever reaches a grower is staggering, right? It's absolutely staggering. Dusty Weis Now, of course, we know that growers, when they're planning for the season ahead, that process starts months and months or even a couple of years before the actual growing season gets started. And so if there's a sudden disruption to the process and they lose one of the tools that they were counting on on having on their toolbox, that could cause big headaches in farm country. So what happened next in this legal story with the EPA here? Stanley Culpepper Well, so once our products… and when you look at the toolbox, I'm thinking about that 1200 active ingredients are registered at the US EPA… Probably 90 to 95% of them had not fulfilled the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. So again, that made us very, very vulnerable for those products to be taken off the market. So the EPA responded because they understand how important it is our growers continue to provide the food, feed and fiber for humankind, national security. And we could talk a whole show just about the importance of our growers. Dusty Weis Can and have, Stanley. Can and have. Stanley Culpepper But what quickly the EPA did is try to fix the situation, right? Try to make sure when they are making federal actions, again, registering or re-registering pesticides, they are abiding by the requirements within the Endangered Species Act, as well as, lot of you growers have probably heard about FIFRA and other requirements that they have. So basically they're trying to come into compliance with all the laws and regulations that they have to follow when they go to bring us a new tool or re-register that new tool for us. So that's really what we've done the last couple of years. We were vulnerable to losing our tools to the courts. The EPA responded like they had to, because if they didn't, we potentially wouldn't have many of these tools even now. Since then, really the last one to two to three years, many of the ag stakeholders, including your group have been at the center of trying to, really it's a balancing act. If we don't do anything in the agricultural community, we potentially lose our products completely. But if the EPA is too aggressive with the potential for overwhelming regulations, and the loss of our pesticides or at least a practical use of those pesticides were really a significant balancing act and that's really what we've been doing the last two to three years is trying to keep the tool and not end up with such overwhelming regulations we really can't use the tool. Keeping in mind, who are the true stewards of the environment? Who provide the habitat for the endangered species or the threatened species, right? I will argue a large part of that is the family farm. So we have to figure out how to do this and bring the tools with practical use patterns and protect the family farm and it has been a tremendous challenge and again groups like yours and your engagement and your involvement have been essential to moving forward not back. Dusty Weis Megan, I'm curious as you look back at the last 18 months or so, how has this process played out from your perspective at Illinois Corn? Megan Dwyer Well, in some regards, it's been rapid fire and in others, we're constantly in what's going on. And so I think taking a step back to we first started seeing some of these draft strategies surface, there was a lot there. And to Stanley's point, trying to find really that balance of knowing that we need these products and some of the mitigations even, in order for them to be successful, require pesticide products. And so finding a way to make sure that we are being stewards, are able to follow the label with the intent to really be mindful of potential threatened and endangered species in an area, as well as being able to continue to do our jobs. I mean, we are family farmers, but it's still a job and a business. And so that has to be viable as well. One thing that I think has been really great and a positive note is how receptive EPA and the services have been. I can speak both on the national corn side, as well as speaking for Illinois Corn, being able to be at the table and have a seat and having really great dialogue back and forth with all the folks that are trying to draft and refine these strategies. It was very telling when we went from the draft herbicide strategy into what was the final that came out here just about a month ago and really looking at and how much they took back from that feedback and made those revisions and made it a little more palatable. You know, there's still work to be done. And we're working on comments for the insecticide strategy right now that's in draft form. But knowing that it does seem like there's genuine interest in trying to make this work for all parties. And to Stanley's earlier point, I this all stemmed from litigation, from, you know, potentially not adhering to the statute that existed and being vulnerable to these lawsuits. And so whatever comes out of this has to work for the farmer, but it also has to then make sure that it's going to stop and slow down these lawsuits and the potential for that risk and exposure. Dusty Weis Ultimately in some places farmers, small farming operations, small businesses out in farm country get left out of the discussion entirely. And so it's good to hear that at least the EPA has been able to engage with groups like the National Corn Growers Association to get the input to hear how it's going to trickle down into farm economies and how it's important to have these tools in the box for small growers. But I can imagine that some of the strategies that have been drafted and come up with to address these problems are pretty complex documents, so as you've been engaging with the EPA on getting these strategies put together, what has NCGA focused on making sure to get right for corn growers? Megan Dwyer Obviously we want to make sure things are founded in science, but also recognize the advancements in technology. And there is a bit of a disconnect in what's available for data to support some of the newer precision technologies that are being used to show at what a micro scale we can actually manage and make applications in a field. But I also think it's worth adding that just because the strategy is final, it doesn't mean the work is done. The strategy is a guidance for when a product is registered or re-registered. So we are gonna have to continue to be mindful and diligent to watch products come through that process to see what those potential label changes are given this guidance. And so I think that's something that we're also watching very closely is the resources and capabilities of being able to monitor these products going through. But as I mentioned, and to your question on following the science, wanting to make sure these things work, also trying to make sure that we are representative of our farmers from across the U.S. We know that what happens in the I-states is very different than what happens in Kansas or dry land Nebraska or the irrigation and chemigation. And so I think it's trying to really make sure that we have as many voices that come in to be funneled into one unified voice and making sure that we can try and make recommendations that are going to work for as many of our growers as possible. Dusty Weis Certainly one of the really valuable aspects of having National Corn Growers Association on the job here is that they represent growers from so many of those states across the country. Stanley, I wanted to get your perspective as someone who works primarily with weeds here at the University of Georgia Extension. In your work, you're focused on one of the reasons that farmers need herbicides, weeds, especially the ones that have developed some resistance to some of the types of herbicides that are out there. So how do you think about this issue knowing what farmers are facing right now? Stanley Culpepper You know, we understand and well documented the importance of having effective and efficient herbicides and the value that they return not only to the family farm sustainability, but our ability to again, produce the amount of food, feed, and fiber for to support the world. Right. So we have to have tools in the toolbox, and I not only work agronomic crops, I work vegetable crops. And some of my vegetable crops, I only have one or two tools. We're talking about maybe losing one or two tools sometimes in agronomic crops. That may be all I have. So again, every single tool that we have in that toolbox is critically important. And that's why I think the process of working together, just like Megan said, it has been unbelievable. In my opinion, when the draft herbicide strategy came out, it was a catastrophic disaster, at least for our family farm, and I think for most family farms. But when the final strategy came out, the difference between the two, absolutely monumental. Ag stakeholders, like the corn growers, like the soybean growers, cotton growers, all of these individuals had a tremendous influence on that. But a lot of credit actually goes to the EPA. You mentioned EPA's engagement. EPA has spent so much time, not only visiting with us, but visiting with actual farmers to understand what we do, how we do it, why we do it. That engagement, again, credit to them, because they've invested a lot of time and a lot of effort to understand what we do. But through that engagement, I think there's been a lot of learning on both sides, right? Our regulatory partners now understand how much we steward these tools, how much we cherish these tools and how important they are, whether it's weed resistance management or control or any type of pest management. And at the same time, I think we respect how complex the litigation component of ESA is, how complex herbicide strategy is, insecticide strategy will be, fungicide strategy coming soon after that, right? So I think the relationships are always the key to success. And one of the positives through this process is building those relationships with our regulatory partners. And I mentioned the EPA, but we actually started an ESA pilot program three years ago in Georgia, doing a lot of the mapping work of where these species are and where our farm fields potentially overlap with species or species habitat. And we got to work with the Fish and Wildlife Service and it's been absolutely phenomenal. Just a wonderful experience, great people. Everybody wants to support our farmers. We just have to figure out how to do it in a science-based approach that can withstand continued litigation. Megan Dwyer Yeah, I want to echo that. So we have rusty patch bumblebee in Illinois. We've also been working with Fish and Wildlife here, working and connecting them with some farmers and talking through how this can work. And just want to echo just how refreshing it is to work with them on trying to share this common goal of finding something that's going to work both for the farmer, knowing that they need to stay successful and stay in business and also be mindful of what we can do to truly protect and what makes the most sense to protect some of these species. And so just want to echo that, the services have been wonderful in all of this. And it really has shown that when you're willing to show up and try and find a compromise, they're equally interested in sitting down and trying to figure this out together. Dusty Weis Well, and Megan, I'm sure it's reassuring for folks to hear that all these stakeholders are working on their behalf to get this done in a way that's hopefully not going to be overly burdensome. There's another group of stakeholders who are working toward that same goal. And that is the manufacturers of these products that we've been talking about. So joining us now to talk about those pieces of the crop protection puzzle is Corteva's Global Stewardship Director, Bill Belzer. Bill, thank you so much for joining us and thank you to Corteva for sponsoring this episode. Bill Belzer It's our pleasure, Dusty. Glad to be here and have had a chance to work with NCGA over the years and couldn't be more proud to be a part of this and help sponsor these activities. It's a great, great thing. Dusty Weis Well, and Bill, throughout the conversation so far, this concept has come up over and over again from Megan and Stanley. They keep coming back to this notion of being stewards of the tools that we use to protect our crops. As the global stewardship director at Corteva and also as someone who works on a family farm in Southern Iowa, what does stewardship mean to you? Bill Belzer Great question. I get that question quite a bit. And it really comes down to responsible use of a product from its inception to its use in the marketplace, and then ultimately its discontinuation. So that's the official definition of stewardship. It's a life cycle approach to responsible product use. I think about how that applies. I mean, we have a family farm in South Central Iowa, as you noted, and farm that with some with my father, but mostly my son. you know, it's, it's, there's multiple dimensions to stewardship that you think about just being responsible, there's financial stewardship, there's product stewardship, there is land stewardship, all those things, we have to consider and think about, can we leave this better than we had received it? I think, you know, knowing farmers, they are the natural stewards of the land. They've had to innovate over the years. I think about my grandfather installing terraces and us moving from reduced till to no till and thinking about all the things to be able to pass our land on to my hope is from myself to my son and ultimately leave it as good or better than what you know I had received it myself that's really what stewardship means to me and it has a personal place in you know in my life as well, not only in what I do but what I do on the farm. Dusty Weis Well, and Bill, it sounds like your grandfather and my grandfather read from the same book of stewardship, because I swear I've heard those exact same words out of my grandfather's mouth. So then when we talk about being stewards of the crop protection products that we use, how do you define that? Bill Belzer When you think about a crop protection product, we spend roughly around $300 million and about 12 years to get a product to market. And a seed product, you know, biotech product, has in-plant protection or herbicide tolerance, we'll spend about $150 million and about 12 years to bring it to market. There's a lot of steps you've got to go through to make that happen. So knowing it's as costly as it is, what we see product stewardship is really, again, responsible use and using best practices ultimately to deliver those products for a long period of time. So we're going to develop all these innovations. We want to be able to maintain those products in the market as long as we can. One element is just general durability. How do you make sure that we manage resistance of it could be plant pests, it could be weeds, a variety of other things. Using best practices and using these products responsibly is a partnership with the grower to be able to take those best practices and extend that life. In addition to that too, we also are in some interesting dynamics and it was talked about earlier on the program about the Endangered Species Act. And the regulatory systems, not just in the US, but beyond as we think about export market approvals, et cetera, are requiring more of us to make sure that we clarify how products are being used responsibly and ultimately if we need to re-register a product, if we need to register a brand new product, those hurdles are getting higher like Endangered Species Act, which we were one of the first to go through with the Enlist herbicide product. All those things, if we are able to use those products responsibly at the farm gate with that partnership, it all aids in the process to get products re-registered and ultimately new products, new innovations to get registered as well. Dusty Weis You know, it's interesting because I don't think that people have always thought about crop protection products or seed products as the kind of thing that you steward for the future. When you talk about a product, people think of it as something that you put it on the field once or twice or four times throughout the course of a season and it does what it's supposed to do. And then next year you do the same thing if you need to. But I don't know if there's been that mentality around these things that you need to preserve for future generations. But I think the conversation is changing around that. How has that conversation changed over the past decade or so, would you say, Bill? Bill Belzer I mean, it's interesting as you watch weed species as an example, when we think about different herbicide actives that have ended up with some resistance issues. We've also seen, even with insect traits, where in certain cases, certain traits have become less effective because of use. Farmers can appreciate this, they're racing against biology. Our job as a company is to help them get ahead of that biology and we bring those innovations in. I think the fact that we think about mode of action on herbicides and we want to mix those things up to ultimately get ahead of potential races of weeds that encumber us and are shifting or bugs that are shifting, and so we need new modes of action for insect control. I think those have become very apparent in the last decade, and the need for us using these innovations in a way that helps us to ultimately, again, end up with grower success. I mean, at end of the day, we're about a grower’s success. We want them to be able to maximize their capability on every acre because that's the need, especially in times like this, we want to help maximize their yield and do all we can to be able to provide the most productivity per acre. And so that's why that partnership is critical is delivering those technologies and using them in a way that we can create not only a length of time for that product to be viable in the market, but also prepare us when we go to EPA or USDA on the next new product, that it's a marketplace and environment that is well suited to say we're not gonna put onerous regulations around XYZ product. Dusty Weis Well, we've all got a part to play. Certainly yours at Corteva is to help us stay one step ahead of evolution, and ours out in the field is to follow the label and put the products on as they're designed to be used. And so if we all do our part, we're going to be able to continue to build on yields, continue to provide food, feed and fiber for the world. Bill, we really appreciate your taking the time to join us today and provide a perspective from Corteva. Your Corteva’s Global Stewardship Director, Bill Belzer. Thank you for joining us and a big thank you once again to Corteva for inviting you and for sponsoring this episode. Bill Belzer Thanks, Dusty, and thanks everybody listening. Dusty Weis This is the Cobcast: Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association, and I'm Dusty Weis. And before the break, we were discussing EPA's process for showing that it's in compliance with the Endangered Species Act and what that could mean for farmers with Megan Dwyer, the Director of Conservation and Nutrient Stewardship for Illinois Corn, and Stanley Culpepper, an extension weed scientist with the University of Georgia. And Megan and Stanley, a few weeks back, the EPA published its final strategy for herbicides. What do farmers need to know about it? Megan Dwyer Yeah, I think starting out, as we mentioned earlier, that these strategies are going to influence future label decisions. And so for farmers to be aware that as new labels come out, they're probably going to have to, at least in the short term, go to a couple different sites, to really find out if they're in an area, if there's going to be additional requirements for them, and what they're asked to do to make sure that they are applying and using a product on label. For our farmers, we've been trying to get them to think about this in two buckets. There's the runoff and erosion side and then your spray drift bucket. The runoff and erosion are a point system. We are anticipating seeing those points range from zero to nine. Most cases, we're hoping to stay somewhere under a six, but all of that is going to be product-based usage and all sorts of variables going into that. And then your spray drift, there's going to be a buffer requirement that can be reduced by a percent based on different activities. So helping them get prepared and think through how they're currently applying products, what they can do if they need to make a change. Maybe they're already doing all of the right things and they have enough points doing enough things to negate some of that spray drift buffer. But just trying to make them think and frame that up in those two buckets is kind of where we've been coming from from the corn family. Stanley Culpepper Yeah, so on my end, kind of from the Cooperative Extension Service, really the last three years, what we have been doing is generating data: data after data after data, trying to develop processes to understand exactly where species are, where they need protection. We've been trying to develop data on mitigations to expand the proposed mitigation menu and to expand the point values, which I think we were collectively monumentally successful. Again, kudos to the EPA for willing to work with us. Now, since the final herbicide strategy came out, at least with herbicides, I believe we move more into an educational component. And if your growers want some really, really good reading, it's about 482 pages in the herbicide strategy. But if you were to actually go read it, you'd probably have a few adjectives where we won't talk about here. But when you get through it, two things I think will come to mind. One is flexibility. And this is what we worked so hard to get, flexibility in the requirements to use our tools. And then complexity, right? There's a direct correlation on how complex this is gonna be. So as we move to the educational component, helping the growers adopt practices or at least document the practices that they're already doing, it's gonna be really, really unique I think across the country. So for example, my approach in Georgia for cotton or soybean grow or even a corn grower may be completely different than that in your part of the world. So one thing I will say is advisors… if you have advisors, you know crop consultant or like for us you have the cooperative extension service… those individuals that have access to advisors that are knowledgeable of herbicide strategy and its flexibility. They can be very, very creative to take advantage of what we do every day and that's steward these tools. So that is gonna be a significant challenge for us. The good thing, and I think Megan said it, we have time, right? The first real restriction on us is still quite a ways away. The final herbicide strategy is nothing but the framework that will be used to implement restrictions on us in our future. So we have time, but it's the educational component helping the growers understand the process. And I'll give you an example. So Megan said, run off erosion, you're gonna have somewhere between zero and nine points. Well, my goal is gonna be try to get every one of my growers to nine points because if I can get them to nine points, then that keeps me from having to look at 70 different herbicide or pesticide labels on a given farm, right? So there are a lot of creative approaches and the educational component I think is going to be key to that but you have to stay in tune. And the other thing I will mention there are a lot of different scenarios or different processes that are information that's going to come out to you. For example, the US EPA is developing a calculator. This calculator I think is going to be so powerful, not only to help you keep up with your points with front-off and erosion mitigation, but maybe more importantly, if it's done like I hope they do it, it'll be an educational tool. So if you don't know what a mitigation measure is, for example, right there in the calculator, hopefully we'll be able to click on it. And when we click on it, it will define it for us. So there's so much effort from all the ag stakeholders to develop information, unify that information as much as possible and to deliver it. It's kind of like we want to train the trainer, but also we're gonna train the farmer. And I think that's really what's gonna happen in the not-so-distant future, but the local influence can be tremendous if they understand the flexibility in the final herbicide strategy and they're creative. Megan Dwyer And Stanley, I'm so glad you brought up the EPA's tool that they're in development because I think it is important to note that while the private sector and educational institutions are very engaged in working on providing some of these resources that EPA also isn't trying to leave us out there hanging. They are working diligently to try and provide some of these resources as well. And some of the tools, as you mentioned, where a farmer, an applicator, an advisor can go and start plugging in some of this information to feel even more confident in what's already being done, what's needed to be done, and be better prepared knowing that these decisions are happening months in advance of application in most cases. Stanley Culpepper I'm so excited about the calculator, right? It's still in development. So I don't know if the end product will be where my vision is, but you know, I can envision my growers spending an hour or two with the calculator and then me taking about 10 to 15 minutes with them and we're going to complete the process, right? So that's in my dream and it's going to vary, right? Remember, this is the complicated part of this. The way this is designed, we on the farm… and we farm in Northeastern North Carolina… we have to make a decision by for every field as influenced by the crop and the products that we want to apply. So think about that. If you just think about the number of fields we have, the number of pesticides we're going to apply in that given field as it relates to a crop, it can very quickly become overwhelming, absolutely overwhelming. What I do is encourage you not to get overwhelmed. Again, if we're creative with the flexibility that we're giving, those of us as educators can help you monumentally make it through the process. And the other big picture, and this is the big picture that I think is extremely important. In Georgia for a decade now, we have focused on pesticide stewardship. In fact, we created a flagship program using pesticides wisely. We've actually reduced off-target pesticide drift by 90 percent. That's the worst part of my job is when a pesticide drift case occurs and I have to go stand between two farmers. So we're doing everything that we can to prevent it. The overall goal of what we're doing with herbicide strategy is to help make sure the product goes on target and stays there. Megan talked about particle drift. Megan talked about runoff. They're the two biggest ways that a pesticide will leave a field. So the bigger part of this is your listeners, your growers have to do their part. You as a grower have to understand the sensitivity or the sensitive spot we're kind of in with these products and you have to do your part to make sure you put the products on target and you keep them there. If you look at off-target particle drift, there's a lot of credit for getting your boom height right. Boom height has a tremendous influence on off -target movement. As does droplet size, right? So there are some positives. We just have to work through the complexity to communicate the right information to the grower that'll make the grower better and recognize them for what they're already doing. And that's stewarding these pesticides and stewarding the environment and all the other things that we do every single day on that farm. Megan Dwyer You know, the other thing, Stanley, you mentioned all the research that you guys are doing, and I just have to give a shout out to you and the other extension agents and other people doing this, because we keep hearing from EPA that it really depends on the data. They want to do things, they want to incorporate new things, but it takes data. It takes work by people like you that are out there trying to showcase the latest technology and what a farmer might typically be doing and the outcome of that. And so I think that's the other important side is having being open to making sure that it, you know, if somebody wants to come on and do some trials on your farm or bigger field scale things, that that's really important to get these things right and make sure everything is counted and being looked at in these decisions and suggestions. And the boom height thing makes me think as well, something that we're still working through and trying to figure out, knowing that from a corn acre, especially on our insecticides and fungicides with these rules still being in draft mode, that a lot of those applications happen later in the season and happen with an aerial application. And so you get a little more limited on how you can make those changes with an airplane. So what are the other creative ways to your point that we can address that? Are there things with a drone application that might be more acceptable and show some better results on keeping that product where it needs to be? Knowing different crops, different timings are all very important as we try and figure out one rule, one strategy that's going to work for everything. Stanley Culpepper Yeah, you made a great point. In my picture of success, and again, I'm an optimist. A lot of people won't be as optimistic as I am that, you know, we face so many challenges every single day on the farm. We don't need any more, but this is another challenge that we will overcome if we work together. But I think the three key components to our success, if we're going to be as successful as I hope we are, science without a doubt. Science never loses in the regulatory agency. Science is powerful. But then it's also agriculture stakeholders like yourself. If you and many others were not as engaged and vocal and fighting for our family farms like you are, the opportunity for me to deliver science is much less, much, much less. So again, that is absolutely essential. And then I will say what you basically have already said, the willingness for our regulatory partners… And for me personally, that's the EPA as well as the Georgia Department of Agriculture and U.S. Fish and Wildlife, the willingness for them to visit our farms, to learn about agriculture, to visit our studies so they can actually see the studies in progress. So then when they get the data at the end of the year, it means more to them, right? Their willingness to do that, we have to applaud because that is not something that I think was done nearly as effectively in the past. And I'll finish up with this. I've been doing this a long time, so I'm in my 25th year. And throughout my career with weed control slash herbicides, what usually happens is something goes bad, it hurts our farmers bad, and then we get together and try to solve the solution. For the first time in my career, we're actually solving the solution before it hurts our growers. If proposed herbicide strategy had come out on our growers, it would have been devastating. Now I'm not saying the final herbicide strategy is gonna be a bunch of roses, but the opportunity for us to do this without significantly harming our growers, it may be some discomfort, but without significantly hurting our growers, it's quite good, it's quite good. Somebody, somewhere we're have to do additional research, generate additional data to help them, but again, we're blessed because of so many people willing to work together to help our family farms. Dusty Weis I think that's really the most important thing that we can end this discussion on here, Stanley, is the fact that we are lucky to have so many people who are willing to roll up their sleeves and do the work on something like this, because with great tools comes great responsibility. And we all want the same thing at the end of the day. We all want to be able to feed the world, provide fuel and fiber for people in the world. And we all want to be great stewards of the tools and the environment that we have to work with. We're all working toward those same goals, just coming at it from very vastly different perspectives here. And, but for people like you, Stanley, and you Megan, who are out in the fields with the growers, doing the work, working with the EPA and finding a way to find common ground here, this would be a really, really tricky situation. So if we have something to take away from this here, it's that growers need to understand that change is coming. We need to be paying attention. We need to stay flexible and we should probably have an ongoing dialogue with our local extension office or with our crop consultant, with our trusted advisors about what we need to be aware of. But know that what's on that label might change and we've got to follow what's on the label. That's the law at the end of the day. So thank you both so much for joining us to share some insight on the changes that are coming. I think it's safe to say that there's more to come on this topic. So stay plugged in with your local organizations and with the National Corn Growers Association, but certainly NCGA will continue advocating for the flexibility that corn growers need in this transition. So once again, Megan Dwyer, the Director of Conservation and Nutrient Stewardship for Illinois Corn and Stanley Culpepper, extension weed scientist with the University of Georgia.

    "content": "Legislation was introduced in the U.S. House and Senate today that would extend a new sustainable aviation tax credit for biofuels for ten years and prevent foreign producers from accessing the credits. The Senate bill was introduced by Sens. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and the House bill was introduced by Reps. Tracey Mann (R-Kansas) and Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio). The National Corn Growers Association praised the development. “Corn growers are making every effort to help the airline industry lower its greenhouse gas emissions through the use of corn ethanol,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA president Harold Wolle. “We are deeply appreciative of these leaders for introducing legislation that establishes requirements for the tax credit that will level the playing field for America’s corn growers.” The tax credit, referred to as 45Z, is part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in 2022. The law provides tax incentives to refineries that produce biofuels that can be used in commercial aircraft and is part of the Biden administration’s ambitious effort to address climate change. The administration is still hashing out specifics about the credit, including who receives it. Many U.S. biofuel producers are concerned about foreign shipments of biofuels, which in some cases lack proper carbon accounting. Growers have also voiced concerns about the requirements for acquiring the tax credits. In May, the U.S. Department of Treasury released its guidance on eligibility for the credits, which has been met with continued concern by growers troubled that they would be required to implement environmental practices that are impractical in certain climates. Corn grower leaders continue to work with Congress and administration officials to hammer out practical approaches that will help growers access the tax credits.",

NCGA has expressed deep concerns that the plan relies almost exclusively on the use of electric vehicles, requiring that a majority of the specified fleets are electric in less than a decade. A decision of this magnitude will have long-lasting negative implications for the rural economy because it ignores the benefits of ethanol. It is uncertain whether the Senate will consider today’s legislation before the end of the year. NCGA is litigating in federal court against the rule.",

    "title": "Ag Groups Urge Congress to Reauthorize Crucial Trade Program",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), joined by 25 other agriculture groups, sent a letter this week to the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways & Means Committee encouraging them to reauthorize a lapsed trade program, called the Generalized System of Preference. Reauthorizing GSP will help cultivate new foreign markets for growers while providing an economic boost for developing countries. “American food and agriculture enterprises are continuously looking to diversify export opportunities, and the GSP program offers a starting point to broaden and deepen trading relationships with countries,” the letter said. “Our nation’s farmers and ranchers depend on an ongoing dialogue with our partners to compete on a global stage. With challenges emerging in key markets, exploring market access opportunities in new regions of the world will be imperative to keep American agriculture as a leader in global exports.” The GSP program, one of the oldest and largest trade programs in the U.S., expired at the end of 2020. NCGA and NPPC, along with other ag groups, have maintained that any additional delays in reauthorization threaten to undermine the decades of advancements achieved under the program and disrupt future market access opportunities. The letter noted that the program is an important tool to encourage countries to eliminate unjustified trade barriers and follow international standards. For example, the corn industry is grappling with shuttered market access due to Brazil’s ethanol tariff, and the GSP program can help motivate negotiations. But Congress needs to reauthorize it first. “Participation in the GSP program should continue to be conditional on criteria that support U.S. market access into GSP beneficiary countries,” the signatories said. The letter comes as farmers across the country struggle with higher input costs and declining corn prices. The National Corn Growers Association and other ag groups have said expanding markets could help growers during difficult times and beyond. “America’s farmers and ranchers rely on foreign market access to thrive and grow their businesses,” the letter noted. “Allowing signature trade programs to expire for years on end hurts the United States’ credibility as a trusted trade partner.”",

    "title": "Corn and Soybean Growers Critical of Commerce Announcement on Herbicide Tariffs",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and the American Soybean Association (ASA) expressed frustration today with a recently released recommendation by the U.S. Department of Commerce to impose preliminary countervailing duty rates on imports of the herbicide 2,4-D. The decision comes at the behest of domestic herbicide producer Corteva Agriscience, which filed a petition earlier this year calling for antidumping and countervailing duties on imports of herbicide 2,4-D from certain foreign suppliers. Farmers have said that their demand exceeds the domestic supply of the product, and foreign sources help fill this gap. “Access to this herbicide is critical for corn growers. Because there is only one domestic supplier manufacturing 2,4-D, growers in the U.S. must look to foreign suppliers to help meet our needs,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “We would welcome ideas from Corteva on how to ensure that this herbicide is available and affordable for American growers.” Other grower leaders also spoke out about the reccommended duty rates. “This decision to raise duties on imports is disappointing for soybean growers nationwide,” said Josh Gackle, president of the American Soybean Association and a soybean farmer from North Dakota. “We rely on imported generic 2,4-D in combination with other herbicides, to manage weeds efficiently before planting. The increased costs could strain our operations during an already difficult time.” The proposed duties would place a substantial tariff on herbicide imports, which has the potential to impact availability throughout rural America. “This couldn’t come at a worse time,” Wolle noted. “The price of corn has declined by more than 40% over the last two years, and the average cost of producing corn was higher than the average selling price of corn in 2023. We are expecting that margin of loss to be even worse in 2024—even before taking this new trade case into account.” Gackle added, “This is just the beginning of a lengthy process. ASA remains committed to advocating for soybean farmers by engaging with Congress, Commerce and the ITC. We will continue fighting against these duties and work toward a resolution that supports U.S. farmers and their bottom lines as the antidumping and countervailing investigations continue.” Commerce’s announcement follows the International Trade Commission’s vote to move forward with the investigation earlier this year. Commerce is expected to announce final duty rates at some point next year. The International Trade Commission, which has the power to dismiss this case in its entirety, will fully hear the case and make its final determination in 2025.",

    "title": "Over 300 Groups Call on Congress to Pass Robust Farm Bill",
    "content": "Citing worsening economic conditions impacting the nation’s farmers, over 300 national and state groups, including the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and its affiliated corn state grower associations, sent a letter to congressional leaders today calling on them to pass the farm bill before year’s end. Signatories included groups representing farmers, livestock and specialty crop producers, lenders and other essential stakeholders in agricultural communities across the U.S. Commodity and lending groups will head to the Capitol en masse this week to advocate for passage of the legislation with a stronger agricultural safety net. “It is critical that Congress pass a new farm bill that strengthens the safety net as many producers are facing multiple years of not being profitable, and this is causing their overall financial situation to deteriorate,” the letter said. “Some will have challenges as they seek operating credit for the 2025 crop year.” The farm bill is typically passed every five years and supports the nation’s farmers, ranchers and forest stewards through a variety of safety net, credit, conservation and other critical programs. The law was originally scheduled for reauthorization in 2023. Last November, Congress voted to extend the existing legislation to September 30, 2024. Since that point, the leadership from both parties on the Senate and House Agriculture Committees have worked to push the legislation forward. As the farm bill has faced delays, producers across the country have experienced headwinds, ranging from extreme weather to high input costs to uncertain global demand to supply chain disruptions. Since the beginning of the year, the harvest price of major crops traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange have fallen by an average of 21% while total production costs remain near record levels. Farmers and their allies say these challenges have exposed areas of the farm bill that need to be strengthened. “Since the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law, we have realized considerable gaps in the farm safety net due to sharply changing conditions, including the trade war with China, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, COVID-19 and related supply chain challenges, rising foreign subsidies, tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers and other harmful practices,” the letter said. “These conditions seriously tested the effectiveness of the 2018 Farm Bill, and it was only by the aggressive use of supplemental assistance that many farms survived.” The letter noted that the outlook for farm country is even more daunting, as the USDA-projected market prices for the 2024 crop are well below costs of production, and current projections paint another bleak picture for 2025. “The farm bill reauthorization provides an opportunity for Congress to address serious challenges in agriculture,” the letter said. “A durable farm safety net, along with risk management tools like a strong federal crop insurance program, voluntary and locally led incentive-based conservation programs, and enhanced international marketing and promotion programs, will be critical in shoring up America’s farm families and rural communities, which otherwise face an uncertain – and potentially calamitous – future.” READ THE LETTER",

    "content": "With priority legislation in front of Congress this fall, don’t miss the opportunity to make your voice heard. Corn growers need to act now in order to support some important pieces of legislation that are moving through Congress in Washington, D.C. The Farm Bill. The Next Generation Fuels Act. Opening up global trade opportunities to lower the cost of inputs. Your lawmakers need to hear from constituents like you who support these issues. And now is the perfect time to let them know. With lawmakers returning to their home districts for the August recess, we have a golden opportunity to advocate for the issues that matter most to the agriculture community. So in this episode, we’re talking to Lindsay Croke, the marketing director at Illinois Corn, and Luke Crumley, director of public policy and sustainability at Ohio Corn and Wheat, about how local advocacy makes a national impact. They’ll offer practical advice for farmers to stay informed and effectively communicate with their elected representatives and staff, and discuss the opportunities that are available at this time of year for growers to show up and be heard.

Luke Crumley The most effective tool in NCGA’s tool kit is the credibility of our members, period. Dusty Weis Hello and welcome to the Cobcast: Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you're following the show on your favorite podcast app and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at NCGA.com. I'm Dusty Weis, and today we are diving into one of the simplest and most effective ways for farmers to get attention from their policymakers: catching them while Congress is in recess. In this episode, we're going to talk about the state of play in Washington since legislators left town for August recess. Plus, what makes corn growers such powerful advocates for ag issues? And we'll hear from a couple of folks with a lot of advocacy experience to get some practical advice for making the most of time with members of Congress, especially in their home districts. So to kick off the conversation, we're joined by Lindsay Croke, who leads communications and marketing for Illinois Corn. Lindsay, welcome to the show. Lindsay Croke Thanks. Thanks for having me. Dusty Weis Lindsay, you've worked closely with corn growers for your entire career now. How have you seen the topic of advocacy and the approach to it change over time? Lindsay Croke It's an interesting question. I've been around in this world for 20 plus years now. And one of the ways that I think it's changed quite a bit is the method of delivery and the way that we engage with our congressmen. I recall many hours on a fax machine trying to fax letters in to district offices, and also a couple of campaigns where we were packaging literal cobs of corn and mailing them to offices or packaging like stovetop stuffing boxes with how many pennies a corn farmer would get out of the sale of that product, and shipping those boxes to the offices. So, you know, now, after some of the anthrax threats and things, we don't really ship physical things into offices anymore. Some of those modes of delivery had changed a lot. But what hasn't changed is that we really need our farmers to contact their congressmen. The messages often are very similar, and it's really focused on what's happening on their family farms. Dusty Weis I mean, that's just it. A lot of the time, particularly in a modern context, members of Congress maybe don't have the boots on the ground experience in the farm fields that our members can go out and expose them to. And so if they're going to go to Washington and work on issues that are important to corn growers, then corn growers need to be in their ear. And that's certainly what we're here to talk about today. We've got another expert as well from a couple states over from where you're at. Luke Crumley, the director of public policy and sustainability of Ohio Corn and Wheat. Luke, you've got a varied background, including work as a district staff member. That means that you actually worked on behalf of a member of Congress in their home district. What's something that you took away from that experience? Luke Crumley That's right, Dusty, and I’ll echo Lindsay. Thanks for having us on here today. And as Lindsay was talking about mailing in those various gifts to a congressional office, I had to chuckle to myself a little bit of post-traumatic stress because I was a congressional staffer in the early 2010s, when we really got serious as congressional staff about threats. And we had these boxes that came in… they were called hoods, and they allowed us to screen all that mail. And yeah, advocacy groups had to evolve over time. But to your point, I have a bit of a different background. I started my career in the United States Marine Corps as a commissioned officer. Then I went to work for a member of Congress while going to grad school, stayed with that member for about seven and a half years in the district office, helping with constituent casework, helping folks navigate the federal bureaucracy, doing field representative work where I would go out and engage with local communities or advocacy organizations like NCGA, and then evolved that into some work on the political side. And after a couple of members that I worked for decided it was time to move on, and that's when I joined up with Ohio Corn and Wheat. But to Lindsay's points here, it has evolved. You know, we still had a fax machine in the congressional office when I stopped working in that space back in 2019, and folks were still sending us faxes at that point. And now we're to the point in just a few years where, NCGA, we leverage resources that allow us to text our members, the members of NCGA, and let them know when something important is happening and allows them to respond within seconds to let their elected officials and the regulators, those federal bureaucrats who don't necessarily have a direct constituency hear directly from corn growers. It's been awesome to see and be a part of. I have the pleasure of serving on the grassroots committee for NCGA, where the national staff and state staffs get together and work out how we're going to do this even better, and we've got a really bright future with it, because everyone really understands this is how we're going to make a big difference into the next decade. Dusty Weis Well, and you're certainly not the kind of guy to toot your own horn here, but I'll call it out, too. I can only imagine that experience working in a congressional district office is wildly invaluable in doing what you do now, because you know what those people are going through. And so that's why I think this podcast episode is going to be such an eye opener for folks here, because we could really talk about the value that in-district advocacy has. So thank you both again for joining us today. As we mentioned already, the House and the Senate are on recess right now. The August recess is kind of like the seventh inning stretch for Congress. It's their chance to go home, get their heads right, and then come back and finish the game strong in Washington before they all have to go back to the home districts and spend the final month or so campaigning, because, of course, there's a big November election coming up as well. But what that means is that in this last month that they're about to head into in DC, there is a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of work that they have to get done before they go back to the districts for campaigning. So before we get too far into the opportunities that we see during the recess here, let's look at the state of play. Where do things stand right now as far as a lot of the issues that our members, our corn growers, care about? Luke Crumley I think, Dusty, if you were to ask the average corn grower in Ohio right now, the state of play question, they'd be very frustrated. And we've been honest with them that we're frustrated too. The political dynamic in Washington, it's always been partisan. Let's dispel that. It's always been as partisan. There are always things in the way of making good policy happen, and that's why we focus so much on equipping our advocates to show up time and time again, instead of seeing victory only as a single piece of legislation getting passed. You know, when we're working on these really complex issues, like a $1.2 trillion Farm Bill, $1.2 trillion Farm Bill that is so massive. It's really incomprehensible to the average person, let alone someone who has other real things they need to focus on, like getting a crop in the ground, making sure they're getting their summer treatments done, and preparing for harvest, all while balancing out really low commodity prices right now. So I think if we are talking about the state of play right now, I think growers are aware that the friction in D.C., we may think it's as bad as it's ever been or worse, but I think we all understand the reality that heading into the fall, we have a compressed schedule. There are these big ticket items out there that are still hanging around, like the Farm Bill, which may have to get extended, may have to go into the next Congress. We have bills like the Next Generation Fuels Act, which is a top priority for national corn that we're trying to introduce the concept of to people still, so that folks outside of the Corn Belt understand we can deliver a high quality, low cost fuel option for the American people. And that goes without covering all the other things like trade issues when we have the national corn team focused so heavily on protecting our overseas markets and opening up opportunities for inputs to come in so that we can address the bottom line issues that our growers are facing. It is so easy to accept the fact that our growers should be frustrated, they should be ticked off. They have every right to be. And as we're in the August recess, my only advice to our growers is find a way to channel that constructively. Because when you're in this August recess, you mentioned, Dusty, that this is a time for members of Congress to go home and get their heads right. It's the exact opposite. I can tell you as a congressional district staffer, it is the exact opposite. You are going full steam ahead because you only get so many days back home with the people who vote for you. Dusty Weis Well, and to your point, Luke, about being constructive about it. The last thing that you want when you leave a city like Washington, DC, where there is so much screaming, is to go back to your home district and get screamed at by somebody. That's not effective advocacy. Luke Crumley Yeah, the most effective tool in NCGA’s tool kit is the credibility of our members, period. Something like 84% of the American public trust farmers. And we can lose that trust like that just because of one bad action. So when we talk to our growers about the importance of hosting a member of Congress at their shop or joining us for a tour, or going and visiting with them as part of a fundraiser, if that's an opportunity that's available. You know, these are really important tactics that help us build that credibility more and more over time to set us up not for November 5th, Election Day, but for November 6th and every day thereafter. Dusty Weis So you mentioned a little bit of the legislation that we're still hoping to get taken care of this year, or if not next year, then with the next Congress as well. But what are the priorities that corn growers have for that legislation, particularly that big old Farm Bill that you mentioned? Lindsay Croke This year we really focused on the Farm Bill, and I would say the top priorities for NCGA and for our state associations are number one, to protect crop insurance. Specifically, I can speak to Illinois farmers. That is their top priority. When we ask them what they want out of a Farm Bill is a robust crop insurance program that works for them. Secondly, we're really interested in funding for trade promotion projects like the Market Access Program and the Foreign Market Development Program. And so those programs haven't seen any increase in funding in a lot of years. Luke Crumley Since George W. Bush was president! Lindsay Croke Yeah. And things cost more. So those programs just aren't as effective as they used to be, even though they're very, very important, specifically in Illinois, based on our position on the Mississippi River and the Illinois River, we export more corn than any other state in the nation. So very, very important for corn farmers in Illinois specifically and for all the states. And then I think we're also interested in those title one programs and kind of how those programs function. Specifically, recently we've talked about having a base acre update, which kind of like updates the program for the crops that are grown today on the acres that are grown today. And so we're just watching how that plays out in advocating for the policy that our farmers adopted in the last session of Corn Congress. Luke Crumley I couldn't have said a better Lindsay. And, you know, beyond the Farm Bill, because this is a problem. I'll open this up a little bit for the farmers who are going to listen to this. As a congressional staffer, it is very easy to assume that everything the farm community cares about is contained in the Farm Bill. And we know that that is just patently false. We have to own the issue of biofuels unlike any other organization, and a good chunk of our policy exists outside of the Farm Bill, especially in that portfolio. A good chunk of our policy priorities exist in other parts of the legislature and other parts of the federal bureaucracy. We have to be competent on a lot of issues. It's just that right now the Farm Bill has to get done. It has to get done. It either needs to be extended before September 30th, so that Congress has enough time to pass a compromise package in lame duck, or we need to get the darn thing rolling and get it done before September 30th. So that's really important. It's what's forefront in our minds, but we can't drop the ball on all these other things, and also things that we don't normally talk about. Because starting in 2025, there's going to be a national debate about tax policy because of the expiration of the Trump era tax cuts. And if we are not ready for that, we are doing a disservice to our members. That's why back in January of this year, the National Corn team, through the Risk Management Action Team, started working on that problem in particular and is investing significant resources into understanding what needs to be most important for us to go into that fight in 2025. Dusty Weis And Luke, you mentioned the Farm Bill and the deadlines to get anything done in this session of Congress. At the risk of pointing out the obvious here to all note that any member of Congress who's able to step up and make significant progress and get that Farm Bill over the finish line before those deadlines, is going to go back into their districts in farm country with a huge feather in their cap to use during their reelection push throughout the final part of the year here. Luke Crumley Well beyond farm country. Because let's not forget that the bulk of the Farm Bill is actually the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and other food programs. So when we talk about the Farm Bill, this is a Farm Bill for all of America, not just farming and rural America. And the folks who go and use those benefits, those SNAP benefits, what are they buying? They're buying American agricultural products. This is a feather in the cap for anyone in the legislature. Republican, Democrat, House, Senate. It doesn't matter. Passing a Farm Bill is the right thing to do, not only for rural America, not only for corn growers, but for every one of the citizens in this nation. Dusty Weis I got to say, there's a lot riding on these 39 remaining legislative days here, folks, including decisions that are going to have a big impact on farmers. But speaking for myself, it can seem like an awful lot to keep up with two. Do you have any advice for growers on the best way to try to keep their finger on the pulse of every darn thing that's going on in D.C.? Lindsay Croke I have a lot of ideas. I think one amazing idea would be to start thinking about legislation the way that Luke just presented it. Think about what it means to you from an agricultural district, but also think about what it means to the person that you are talking to and to the people they represent. So in Illinois and all the states, but specifically in Illinois, that's where I'm at. You know, we have so many representatives that are up in the Chicagoland area with largely urban constituencies. And when we talk to them, when we meet with them when they're home during August recess, we have to think about who they're representing and why the Farm Bill matters to them. And if we don't talk about why it matters to them and the people they're representing, then we're really missing the mark in that personal conversation. So I think that's one really important thing. I also really think… I'm coming from a communications perspective. So for me, I think that people need to really think about where they're getting their news from. And really thinking critically about paying attention to their ag associations and their commodity groups looking for accurate, unbiased information about what might be happening on ag related issues in Washington, D.C.. I think that is really, really important, and I would lean into your commodity groups to provide that for you. If you're not already a member of the Farm Bureau or a corn association or a soybean association, I think you should become a member so you have access to that information and the kind of insider ball game that might be happening that you don't know about. I think you should watch Politico or AgriPulse if you're interested in federal policy, like really think critically about how you're getting your news. And I also think if there's a better way for your association to communicate with you and help you understand and position you for conversations with your leaders, then we want to know what that better way communication is. I want to get better at making sure that farmers are empowered to go with confidence to their leaders of Congress and in their state government, and talk about the issues that are important to them and the impact on their family farms. Luke Crumley Yeah. Where we are right now, there are so many channels where people can find out information. The difference is where do you go to find wisdom? Where do you go to find something that's going to help you as a grower to communicate effectively to your neighbors, to those elected officials when you do have that opportunity? So to drill down on one of Lindsay's points here, if you are not currently a member of National Corn Growers Association, you need to join through your state association. When you join or renew your membership, you have the opportunity to opt in to those communications. Because we intentionally don't try to flood your inbox. We want you to know that when you see an email from us or a text message from us, that it's actually something that matters in the moment. So when you join, you help us make sure that folks across the country are able to hear that important message from the National Corn Growers Association. Joining up is the best way to get information yourself and then help amplify all of that messaging that we're trying to push in Washington and in state capitals around the country. Dusty Weis And I'll point out one more thing, too. Up here in Wisconsin, I know that if I'm ever going to have the ear of a member of Congress who's doing an event in the district, and I know I'm going to cross paths with them, I just shoot an email over to Wisconsin Corn Growers and say, hey, I'm going to be talking to representative XYZ. Can you give me just a couple of pointers, a couple of smart questions that I can ask. And I have never met a staffer who didn't jump at that opportunity to help advance the message that they've got to take care of. So some great points there. And as long as we're talking about that advocacy, there's no word more prized, more valued in Washington, D.C., than the word “grassroots.” And I don't think it gets any more grassroots than the people that spend all day, every day out in farm fields, tending to the crops and the roots that they've planted throughout the year. You mentioned that NCGA and state organizations like yours have policy experts to dig into those details. So where do farmers come in then? How do they use the expertise that's at that state level and become better advocates for their cause? Luke Crumley So I would point out that it's a two way street. Okay. So we as state staff at Ohio Corn and Wheat, we don't claim to be the experts in farm production. We do claim to be an expert in helping connect our growers to the people that need to hear for them, right? But for us to set policy, and this is the same across the federation of states that we have here in NCGA. We depend on our grower leaders to tell us what's important, right, to give us the big concepts and then equip us to go and fight through those details. So it's a two way street. We need to understand what the priorities are for the grower. And then on the other end of the equation, when those priorities are being worked through, through the legislative process, through the administrative process, whatever, it's our job to then go and take that Washington speak and make it approachable for our growers so that they know, a, this isn't urgent, I don't have to respond right now, but it's something that my team is keeping me informed on. Or, if it is urgent. Okay, not only is the issue here and I understand it now, but I'm equipped to act and I can use this state staff, this national team to get my ideas directly to decision makers. So it's that two way street. It's really important. Lindsay Croke I would lean back into to something that Luke alluded to earlier, that farmers have a lot of trust everywhere, and no one's going to be more trusted than a farmer in someone's district on a specific ag issue. And so as I think about why do we need farmers? What's the value in this Hill advocacy equation of the farmer? There are exactly three people in Washington, DC that care what I have to say, and it is my two senators and the congressmen elected to represent me. And if I want to have access to the other congresspeople that represent Illinois in DC, then I have to have someone, at least one person in every district who shows up, who is willing to put the time in, who's willing to learn a little bit of background information on what's happening and who, honestly, all they have to do is apply it to their own farm. So I know this feels so scary to farmers, potentially. I don't know how to call my congressman's office. What are they going to ask me? They feel like they need to really be up to speed on the issue. Not really. If I reached out to someone and said, hey, we'd like you to call your representative on a Farm Bill issue, all you really have to do is think about, when did I use crop insurance last time? How did that impact my farm? What's my personal story about, you know, maybe I sell all of my grain to the river system for export. What's my personal story? And I need you to pass the Farm Bill, the end. Like that's all it is. And every single farmer that would show up for us knows their own farm. That isn't a hard thing for them to overcome. So if you're listening to this podcast, if you're interested in the policy space, if anything we're saying is interesting to you, we really need your voice. We really need your voice. Dusty Weis All right, well, I've got a voice and a lot of us do, and we've got this wonderful grassroots network spread all across the country here. But looping back to where we started, it's August. It's time to strike while the iron is hot, the congressional members are back in their districts for the recess right now. So where do we find them? What's the best way to get in touch and make those voices heard? Luke Crumley Yeah. So I was joking with an NCAA staffer, I think just yesterday. This person is a prior D.C. staffer for a member of the House, and I'm a prior district staffer. So our perceptions of August recess are very, very different. In Washington, D.C. during the August recess, we used to joke that they'd be wearing flip flops and Hawaiian shirts and kicking back to catch up on their shows while we and the district staff were burning the midnight oil, trying to get our members around. And that's honestly how we perceive it. Because at least six days a week for my member, oftentimes seven days a week, we had events that they needed to participate in, whether that's a county party meeting where, say, your Democratic Party or your Republican Party has a monthly meeting that they have to be attending or it's a tour of a manufacturing facility, it's a farm shop visit. You are trying to fill every single day with multiple events and trying to squeeze every bit of public exposure out of that opportunity of having that member of Congress home. And it can be difficult to try to figure out when you're going to have those opportunities because their schedules aren't public. It's not public record. So it's not like you can just hop on their website and see exactly where they're going to be. And in fact, from a security standpoint, it'd be a really bad idea on their part. Right? So it's really important for folks to hear this message again. When you join organizations like Ohio Corn and Wheat, Illinois Corn, and NCGA, the National Association of Wheat Growers, or whatever, when you join an organization like that, you're hooking into a team, and it's a team that oftentimes does have visibility of some of those opportunities. So in my role, I not only manage our grassroots, I also manage our political action committee. I manage our grass tops activity. And when growers approach me the way you just described earlier, Dusty, with picking up the phone and calling Wisconsin Corn. And, you know, just yesterday I got a call from a grower. He was approached by someone who wants to have a member of Congress out to his farm. What's he do? He picks up the phone, he calls me, and now I know I can notify a few other people who are interested in this space, that this is an opportunity they can take advantage of. And we're constantly doing that throughout August in Ohio, trying to make sure that every member of our delegation that we know of an event, we're trying to get a grower there in front of them. So we will help equip you to do that. And when you join an organization like NCGA, you hook into an infrastructure that helps you do that more effectively. Dusty Weis So you're able to go out, you're able to meet them at events… I’ll add county fairs. A big one up here in Wisconsin, we've got breakfast on the farm, which is a great opportunity. And even in my hometown of Monroe, Wisconsin, we've got a big celebration coming up in September called Cheese Days. And I can promise you that every single congressional representative that represents Monroe, Wisconsin will be in the Cheese Days parade. But if you can't meet them out and about, bring them to you. Lindsay. What if they're too busy to make it to a visit to your farm? Can you go meet them on their turf? Lindsay Croke Dusty, you can always call your district office and request a meeting. If you're really interested in meeting your member of Congress. Luke Crumley I want to put some context around here because we all do this, myself included. We put this target on trying to get in front of the member of Congress or the member of your state legislature. I want to share some math here, and I share this when I train advocates within Ohio. If you take the average number of people that a member of Congress represents, a little over 780,000 780,000 people. If you were to give each and every one of those people an equal amount of time throughout the year, and you never let that member of Congress go to sleep, stop to eat, or go to the restroom, each one of us would get less than 45 seconds. Each one of us would get less than 45 seconds if we had the most draconian approach possible. Right? That's why members of Congress have staffs. Now, it's great to get in front of the member of Congress. That is the decision maker. But that decision maker is an inch deep and a mile wide on literally a thousand issues. So what can we do to equip them? We can build credibility and relationships with their staffs. And this is where the district staff comes in. Really valuably for growers, because it is not easy to get to Washington, D.C. every few weeks if that's what you need to do. Instead, you can develop, you can cultivate a relationship with a local staffer who may not be writing legislation, but who is tasked with understanding what's happening in the community and conveying that through their team to anyone who needs to know it. And there are organizations that are really successful at doing that, but it starts with us as an individual being able to say, okay, I need to understand this member of Congress is a human being. They are not going to be everywhere I want them at all the times I want them. I need to have a little bit of humility and accept that. But I also need to have a little bit of ambition and be willing to go build a relationship with these 20 and 30 somethings that work for them, who actually do the day to day work for the constituency, and who have the ear of that member. And as I build credibility with them, I build credibility with the team. That's what's important in August. It's not necessarily trying to target and get in front of the member. It's about not missing a single opportunity to build credibility, whether that's in person, at a district office, in front of the member, or on social media, by simply not posting something derogatory when you feel inclined to do so. Lindsay Croke Developing a relationship with staff is so, so important. And frankly, if this August doesn't feel like your window, if a farmer were willing to work to have a phone call or meet in person with the district staff once a month, by the time we get to next August, that farmer would 100% probably get a meeting with his or her member of Congress. Because you have proven yourself workable, you've proven yourself reputable. You've proven that you're focused on your issues. I mean, it's almost maybe a screening process is a bad way to say it, but it kind of is like that. Members of Congress don't have time to engage with every single person, so they're looking for the people who best represent the general industry and are able to eloquently share the story of their family farm in a way that the congressman can understand it. And, you know, to circle all the way back again, if you're nervous about that, representing your family farm in a way that's understandable, plug into an association. And please, please use the resources at your disposal. We need farmers who are interested in doing this, and we're excited to work with you. Luke Crumley Yeah, I may not suggest once a month, but at least once a quarter. That's a really good pace. Lindsay Croke You can make a phone call once a month. Luke Crumley Yeah, we had people that called us every week. So I had one guy who called me every single day for a while. Dusty Weis I think that's such great advice, not just to take that approach and to build and nurture these relationships, because they are relationships, at the end of the day. But to remember that the other person on the other end of that phone, or the other end of that social media message is a human being, too. Whether you're talking about someone who's a member of Congress, who you see on CNN or Fox News or MSNBC, or the staffer who's fielding dozens and dozens of phone calls every day there, they're people, too. Luke Crumley You also never know where that person's going to end up. So a couple of stats here. The average tenure for a member of Congress right now, I think is still right around five and a half years. Don't quote me on that specifically, but it's pretty low. Most people don't realize that because we think of career politicians, but a member of Congress’s tenure is oftentimes very, very short on average. Legislative staff are even more compressed. I think it's something like 18 months average time in a specific portfolio area for a specific member, and then you're trying to move on to the next gig. And whether that's with a new member or a new portfolio within the office. But there's this churn in D.C. It's a little bit different in the district office. I worked for one member for seven and a half years. I worked for his successor for a year, and then I came to corn. So I had eight and a half years to build a relationships in the community where I saw many, many, many legislative staff move on to other things. So you have that component. But I'm going to use my first boss in the House of Representatives as an example, to the point that you never know where these people are going to end up. I first met him when I was in college. He was fairly new to Congress still, and I didn't know this about his background. But prior to being in the state legislature, he actually held the job that he ended up hiring me to do. So he had worked for another member of Congress doing casework, doing field rep work, gone to the state legislature, and then got into Congress himself. When you invest the time in building relationships, building credibility, building rapport with these people, you never know where it's going to land you. And he would receive phone calls to his personal cell phone 15 years later from people he had helped when working for that previous member of Congress. And this is a 20 to 30 year span for his career. That's incredible that these people still remembered what he did for them as a young staffer, and that he still was invested in them enough to be picking up the phone and asking his team to help them out. Dusty Weis And people don't forget it when you treat him like a human being either, and they'll hold on to it forever. Although I've got to say, it's a busy time of year for growers only getting busier as we head into the fall here. And I'm going to say something to both of you, Lindsay and Luke, that I know that you've heard a thousand times, if you've heard it once… “Well, I just I don't really like to get involved in politics.” What do you say to someone who might be hesitant to do advocacy work, because it means interacting with politics? Lindsay Croke I guess I would say, then don't complain. I mean, it's really that simple, right? Like, we have a farmer who always says the world is run by people who show up. We want you to show up. And the thing is, is that you don't have to show up in person. I was thinking through as Luke was talking like, notice when your member of Congress does something great and send them an email to the district office like, thank you for doing this or showing up here, or I saw you quoted in the paper, that was great, right? Like, I think that they need that too and that's a great way to build rapport. I think that it's not that hard for someone who wants to get engaged. And I also think that, you know, everybody has their passion point. Right? So maybe this politics isn't your passion point. There's an opportunity for you to get involved in some regard in your industry. So you need to figure out what that opportunity is for you and what you're passionate about and try to give back in some way. I understand it's busy. We're all busy. You just have to make time for the things that are really important. I also really think, just to add to this whole conversation, one of my personal passion points in my career here with corn and agriculture is encouraging farmers to think bipartisan and really thinking about like, maybe I think I don't want to go visit my member of Congress because he or she is from a party that I don't feel like I'm affiliated with, but again, by seeing that person as a person who probably wants the same general things for our country or for your state that you want and just see a different way to get there, there's still a lot of value in that. And frankly, if agriculture wants a seat at the table when policies are being discussed, we have to be able to have a seat at the table when both parties are in power. That's the way that we can be effective. So I always want to encourage farmers to really think through that. This whole thing is a big chess game, and we have to think about how we're going to play the game strategically and be effective. And so think bipartisan, show up. Thank people. Luke Crumley I will echo what Lindsey just said with a couple of addendums. And now the disclaimer here is I'm a lobbyist, and I spent a good amount of time working in partisan electoral politics. So when Lindsey says don't complain. Like that's the gut reaction that I have too, right? But the reality is that the vast majority of people are never going to pick up the phone and call a congressional district office. The vast majority of people are never going to write a letter to their member of Congress. The vast majority of people don't vote in a given year. So let's flip the script a little bit here. When you join an organization like National Corn Growers Association, one of the things that you're able to do is hook into a team that has lobbyists like me to help you exercise your First Amendment right, the right to redress grievances to the government. That's what lobbying is. It's just using a third party to help you do it. So if you don't want to get in politics because it's either frustrating or it seems to be too much of a burden, whatever. When you join, you are equipping your industry to go do it regardless. Number one. Number two, if the vast majority of people don't get involved, if the vast majority of people don't care enough to do the bare minimum, when you do, you are that much more credible. So our growers who have been on the fence, who have maybe wanted to try it out but have had that reticence because we think of politics as dirty, we think of it as not very glorious, not very glamorous. I get it 100%, I get it. But when you show up, you're doing something that most people won't ever do, and you're going to have impact that most people never will have. Dusty Weis I think there's a lot of wisdom in that, and certainly we get to see it regularly at a national level. We get to, on this podcast, tell the story of some of the great work that the National Corn Growers Association is doing. I'm really glad that in this episode, we got to get down and see what's happening at the state level as well, because but for the work that's happening in the state chapters, it would be impossible for National Corn Growers Association to do what it does on a national level. And so thank you both, Luke and Lindsey, for all the work that you guys do in Illinois and Ohio. Thanks as well to all the other state chapters that are out there grinding on behalf of corn growers every day as well. And let's just recap here, there's a lot at stake between now and the end of the year in Congress. Corn growers have a big opportunity to make an impact while senators and representatives are home during the August recess. So get out there. Make your voice heard, respectfully. Remember, there's a human on the other end, but remember that they're probably pretty interested in the story that you have to tell, and probably pretty proud to be able to go and represent you in D.C. as well. So Lindsay Croke, communications and marketing director for Illinois Corn, and Luke Crumley, director of public policy and sustainability for Ohio Corn and Wheat. Thank you both so much for joining us here on the Cobcast. Dusty Weis And thank you for listening.

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association today urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resolve a dispute between his nation’s railways executives and union leaders that could result in a strike interrupting rail service into the U.S. “If a strike shuts down rail service from Canada into the U.S., it will adversely impact America’s farmers who rely on rail to ship goods between the two countries,” said NCGA President Harold Wolle. “We encourage Prime Minister Trudeau, the Teamsters and Canadian rail workers to do everything possible to avoid such a strike.” Canada is the third-largest destination for U.S. agricultural exports and the second-largest source of agricultural imports. Of great concern to corn growers, a strike could interrupt shipments of fertilizer imports and exports of ethanol, corn and byproducts used as animal feed. The Teamsters have been at an impasse with the Canadian National Railways and the National Pacific Kansas City over labor contracts. Both railways issued notice on Sunday night that they would lock out workers beginning on Thursday if a resolution with the Teamsters isn’t reached. Under federal labor law, Canadian officials can order all parties to enter binding arbitration. On Monday, NCGA joined other agricultural groups in sending a letter to the prime minister calling for action to halt the pending strike. “We plan to keep calling for a resolution on this issue,” said Wolle. “The stakes are high and this is the last thing our farmers need as they deal with a drop in corn prices and higher input costs.”",

    "title": "Congressional Letter to Commerce Questions Tariffs on Popular Herbicide",
    "content": "Eighteen members of Congress sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo yesterday saying they are concerned that tariffs on imports of a widely used herbicide – called 2,4-D – could compromise reliable, affordable access to agricultural inputs. The effort was led by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Reps. Adrian Smith (R-Neb.) and Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.). “Agricultural producers already face record high input costs while competing in a volatile market and prices for all crops are forecasted to decline over the next several years,” the representatives said. “Without careful consideration of the facts during these preliminary investigations, new tariffs will result in difficulties for producers who rely on this critical input. This will only exacerbate their economic challenges.” The National Corn Growers Association supported the congressional effort. “Duties on 2,4-D imports would intensify what is already a difficult period for many growers as key input costs continue to increase,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “The tariffs could make these products hard to acquire and more expensive for farmers. We applaud these members of Congress for pushing this issue with Commerce and we hope the administration will listen.” In May, The U.S. International Trade Commission agreed to advance a petition by Corteva Agribusiness to place anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of the herbicide 2,4-D shipped from two Asian countries. Growers have said America’s farmers cannot rely upon a sole domestic supplier of 2,4-D to meet nearly all the market’s needs, a sentiment echoed in today’s letter. “Given that there is only one domestic source of 2,4-D, with limited capacity to meet domestic demand, American agricultural producers rely on imports to supplement their management plans,” the letter said. “Changes in the duties owed on these products could have far-reaching impacts on producers as they plan their expenses for the crop year.” The Department of Commerce is slated to release preliminary duties by September 10th, though that deadline could be extended. The final rate will not be published until next year.",

Last November, Congress voted to extend the legislation to September 30, 2024, with the Agriculture Committee leaders committing to work together to pass the legislation this year. “We are counting on our elected officials to find a path forward for a strong bipartisan farm bill that can be signed into law this year,” Wolle said. “Let’s get it done.",

    "title": "Corn Growers Call for Reasonable Standards for Accessing Tax Credits for Sustainable Aviation Fuels",
    "content": "The Biden administration should set fair and reasonable criteria around farming practices for farmers and refineries seeking tax credits for sustainable aviation fuels, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) said in comments submitted this week to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. “Ethanol has played a critical role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in cars and trucks, and we can do the same for the airline industry,” NCGA President Harold Wolle noted after the comments were filed. “But we need a level playing field that allows farmers to meet emission requirements using environmentally smart practices that will work on their farms.” The issue stems from tax credits allocated under the Inflation Reduction Act for sustainable aviation fuels that would allow farmers to participate in this emerging market. To produce qualifying fuels under the standards set by the U.S. Department of Treasury, biofuel producers must show they have lowered their carbon intensity score. One way to do that, according to the guidance, is to use feedstocks grown using climate-smart agriculture practices. Corn growers have raised concerns about bundling specific practices that may not work in certain regions of the country. “Corn growers produce a commodity that will help the Biden administration meet its ambitious climate goals,” Wolle said. “But imposing a one-size-fits-all standard for attaining the tax credit will make it hard for us to contribute to the president’s grand challenge.”",

    "title": "EP. 46 - Defending Biotech Corn on the International Stage: An Update On the USMCA Dispute Over Mexicos Ban",
    "content": "Industry experts are trying to return to science in the conversation around biotech corn. Ever since Mexico issued a decree that banned genetically modified corn, there's been confusion and concerns from growers and policymakers alike here in the United States. Mexico is the number one market for U.S. corn growers by a wide margin, and over 90% of the corn that's planted in the United States is biotech. Accordingly, Mexico's decree threatens market access and adds a great deal of legal uncertainty for our corn growers. And ever since the decree was announced, organizations like the National Corn Growers Association, the Corn Refiners Association and the U.S. Grains Council have been leveraging every opportunity to push back. Recently, those efforts resulted in a trade dispute settlement hearing under the USMCA, which represents the best opportunity to reverse this destructive trade policy. So in this episode, we're going to revisit the history of the ban, explore the arguments that were made in the dispute settlement hearing, and discuss what it all means for farmers. Our guests include: Andrew Brandt, the director of trade policy for the U.S. Grains Council Heidi Bringenberg, the U.S. Grains Council’s country director for Mexico Kristy Goodfellow, the vice president of trade and industry affairs for the Corn Refiners Association Nancy Martinez, the National Corn Growers Association's director of public policy, trade and biotechnology We'll also hear about the U.S. Grains Council's work to maintain relations in Mexico, in a segment that is sponsored by Corteva Agriscience.

There are certain regions that have always been a little hesitant about it. That has no basis in science. Kristy Goodfellow This is a huge setback for science, and it’s coming at a time when we really need innovation and new technologies. Dusty Weis Hello and welcome to the Cobcast: Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you're following this show on your favorite podcast app, and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter ncga.com. I'm Dusty Weis, and today we're going to be talking about a topic that has been in the news quite a bit recently: trade with Mexico. Ever since Mexico issued a decree that banned genetically modified corn, there's been confusion and concerns from growers and policymakers alike here in the United States. And in this episode, we're going to talk about the ban, as well as the dispute settlement process that was initiated by the US. We'll hear from experts on the issue about the steps being taken to reverse this measure, and break down what this could mean for farmers. We'll also hear about the U.S. Grains Council's work to maintain relations in Mexico, and a segment that is sponsored by Corteva today. But to start this conversation about trade, we are joined by Andrew Brandt, the director of trade policy for the US Grains Council. Andrew, could you tell us a little bit about why USGC is invested so much in this issue? Andrew Brandt Certainly. Well, thank you, Dusty. Thank you for having me on. This is my first time on the Cobcast, actually. So Mexico is our number one market year in, year out for the last probably two decades, almost, Mexico’s been the number one market for U.S. corn. Certainly this decree as originally written and the updated version that came out in February of 2023, both give us significant pause and concern about what Mexico is trying to do to U.S. farmers ability to utilize the latest and greatest technologies available in the toolbox. So if this decree were fully implemented, and they did a ban on the importation of biotech corn, that would be very disruptive to the trade relationship and very concerning to us. Dusty Weis Certainly a lot of things that are worth keeping track of there. And so we've got a big panel of people that we're talking to today. We're also joined by Kristy Goodfellow, the vice president of trade and industry affairs for the Corn Refiners Association. Kristy, same question to you. Why is CRA involved at this point? Kristy Goodfellow Well, let me start by just thanking you for the opportunity to be here talking about this issue. It's really important. It's a timely discussion, and I'm grateful to be here. The Corn Refiners Association represents all of the seven companies who are operating wet mills in the United States. Those wet mills are refining about 15 to 20% of all of the U.S. corn production, and that production that's being made into food and industrial products that are sent throughout the United States and throughout the world. The export markets are really important to our members. From the United States, they export about $3 billion annually. So that's a lot. And about a third of that production ends up in Mexico. So it's our largest export market, we’re sending about $1.2 billion in refined corn products to Mexico annually. So there's a lot at stake here. On a more personal note, I had the opportunity to work on the USMCA negotiation from my position at USDA, and I think it's a great agreement. And I think its predecessor, NAFTA, was a great agreement. I think it served us well, and it will continue to serve us well if we continue to live by the agreement. There are also just good economic principles here that are pretty compelling. There are things that we can make and grow in the United States and do very well, including corn. And there are things that Mexico produces very well, and we can benefit from that. We have this great proximity to each other and we can be great neighbors. So that's why we're here and engaged in this conversation. And it's very important. Dusty Weis And of course, a lot of that is going to hinge on how this dispute turns out here. And so a lot of attention will be paid to that going forward. But the last person I want to introduce here is Nancy Martinez, the National Corn Growers Association's director of public policy, trade and biotechnology. Now Nancy, NCGA has been active on this issue, including a roundtable discussion on Capitol Hill more than a year ago that we covered on episode 41 of this podcast. But what is at stake for our members here would you say? Nancy Martinez This is NCGA’s top trade issue. Mexico is the number one market for U.S. corn growers by a wide margin. So Mexico's decree threatens market access and adds a great deal of legal uncertainty for our corn growers. Over 90% of the corn that's planted in the United States is biotech. So we're very concerned about policies that serve as a trade barrier. NCGA is the largest and loudest voice for corn growers in the United States, with almost 40,000 members representing 300,000 farmers. So this is a top issue that's on our growers’ minds that we really need to seek a resolution for. Dusty Weis Well, thank you all once again for joining us today. A lot of expertise, a lot of brainpower here to parse this really kind of difficult but important issue. And I want to kick off the discussion just with a little bit of background on the topic for those of us who don't follow it every day like you folks do. Nancy, can you tell us a little bit about what sparked this issue and how we got to the point that we're at? Nancy Martinez Absolutely. So starting back in 2020, Mexico's president, referred to as AMLO, published a presidential decree that phased out biotech corn for human consumption by 2024. And this version of the decree was later modified in February 2023 and replaced all of the previous decrees, but it was effective immediately. So this February 2023 decree restricted biotech corn use for human consumption and also included a part two to phase out GM yellow corn used in animal feed. So these actions violated USMCA, which is the trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada. The restrictions caused major concerns for our corn growers. Mexico is traditionally the largest market for U.S. corn, has been for a very long time. So white corn exports have taken the largest hit because the current ban is on certain uses, including for human consumption. But in the second part of the decree is the phase out for biotech corn use in animal feed, which is also very concerning. So Mexico's incoming administration recently made some comments to walk back part of the decree on part of this phase out for the use in animal feed. But the decree is still in place, as well as several other measures, which is very concerning for our growers. Dusty Weis This is something that we've all been following for almost four years now, with the U.S. and Canada pursuing actions to overturn the ban. How has that process, as it’s set out under the US Mexico Canada Agreement looked so far? Nancy Martinez Yeah. So with pressure and support from NCGA, USTR announced formal dispute settlement consultations with Mexico, as outlined under the USMCA. And then after those consultations completed without a resolution, USTR requested that a panel be established to address Mexico's actions here. So the panel consists of a chair and two members, each selected by the US and Mexico from a predetermined list. So US selects the Mexican citizen and Mexico selects the US citizen. The panel follows a set timeline. So recently the public hearing occurred on June 26th and 27th. An initial report is slated to be completed in September, with a final report publicly available in late November. As submissions are uploaded online, it gives the chance for the public to review them and kind of know where the arguments are falling. But we had a lot of visibility into the best arguments from the US side, as well as the Mexican government in that public hearing that was just completed. Dusty Weis Now, the USMCA, of course, replaced NAFTA as a free trade agreement in North America. And so in a lot of ways, this is one of the first, one of the most high-profile processes that has played out under the new agreement so far here. But it's safe to say that NCGA, the Corn Refiners Association, everybody who's got a dog in this fight is working all the levers that are available to them and taking this process as far as they can. Now, Kristy, I know that this hearing took place a few weeks ago at the end of June. Can you recap for us what happened and what was said? Kristy Goodfellow Sure. Happy to do that and kind of building off what you were saying before about the sequencing of NAFTA in place before this. A lot of the legal arguments that we're talking about are not new to USMCA at all. They go back to NAFTA and beyond that, they go back to the World Trade Organization. So these aren't little nuanced and bilateral agreements that are in place. These are really fundamentals of our international trading system that are under discussion in this dispute. So that's something to keep in mind as you hear me summarize the legal arguments that are being made. The hearing process at this point, as Nancy was saying, the United States and Mexico have provided written submissions. They responded to that in rebuttals. There have been a few non-government organizations that were granted permission to make submissions, and they have made submissions. So the hearing process is really opportunity for the parties to kind of walk through verbally the arguments that they presented in writing and to continue to respond to the comments of the opposing party. The hearing is also an opportunity for the panelists to ask questions and to gather information that wasn't necessarily provided by the party. And of course, people listening carefully to the questions that the panelists ask to try to infer what they might be thinking. So that's something that people talk about and speculate in news reporting on the hearing. Not to bore everyone and muddle this down, but let's stop and kind of clarify what exactly is being disputed in this case, because I think it's important. There are two aspects of the decree that the United States has chosen to challenge. The first is what is called the corn tortilla ban. And that effectively, as Nancy was saying, bans white corn that's imported to make doughs and tortillas. The second aspect of this is what is called the substitution instruction, and that in the decree is very vague instructions that over time, Mexico is to replace GE corn that used for animal feed and for human consumption. There aren't really a lot of details in the decree about exactly how that will be done. The primary argument of the United States really relates to the USMCA agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures. So the United States points out that Mexico has not followed international standards, and there are international standards in place that relate to this measure. And countries don't necessarily have to follow the international standard. They can say, we want a different level of protection for whatever reason they come up with, and then they can move forward with doing a risk assessment that supports that new level of protection. But the United States argues that Mexico did not do any of those things to support this policy. Throughout and in several different ways, the United States also argued that the measure in place, which again is banning certain uses for GE products for human consumption, don't effectively respond to the goals that Mexico is trying to achieve or articulates that they're trying to achieve with it. And those goals are protecting native corn varieties, ensuring the livelihood of indigenous persons, encouraging biodiversity and some others. But again, the United States says these trade measures aren't going to help you achieve those outcomes. And there's some discussion about what would better serve Mexico if they were, in fact, trying to achieve those outcomes. In response to the US argument, Mexico brought a whole cadre of “scientific information.” It's really quite all over the place. But just to name a few areas that they brought in research, scientific information on trans-genetic proteins, antibiotic resistance, unintended gene expression, nutritional deficiencies, biodiversity. So in some cases, the United States challenged the science itself and the finding in those research. In some cases, the United States said that research wasn't really relevant to the dispute. In some cases they said, yeah, that's interesting and great. And had you done a risk assessment that would have been taken into consideration. To give you, you know, just one example of that. Mexico argue that Mexicans eat more corn than anybody else in the world, and that has to be taken into consideration. And the United States says, yes, in fact, that was and would be taken into consideration as part of the normal risk assessment. So that’s just kind of a flavor of the discussions that are going on back and forth in these hearings. Nancy, I'd be interested to hear if you have any additional thoughts or if any of the lines of questioning from the panelists stuck out to you. I know some that were reported on and might be interesting. There were questions related to the sequencing of events in Mexico, you know, when the actual policies came about and trying to figure out maybe, you know, which came first, the policy or the science. There was also some questioning that might give the United States a little bit of heartburn, because they were arguing that these issues weren't related to the dispute, like U.S. corn consumption. And so those were just a few of the questions that people are discussing related to that panelist questions. But interested Nancy, if you have any other thoughts? Nancy Martinez Yeah, that was a great run down and summary, Kristy. You know, I do want to go back to something that you said about Mexico's recurrent argument that they consume more corn than anywhere else in the world, and therefore they're at a higher risk of exposure. And as Kristy said, and I'll just, you know, say it again, that that is a part of a risk assessment to factor in that consumption and that exposure amount. So that's already a part of the international standards and would have been a part of Mexico's risk assessment if they had done one. Another thing that stood out to me in the hearing is Mexico makes an argument about protecting their native corn varieties. Then the U.S. responded, I thought very appropriately, to highlight the fact that Mexico has not been taking measures to protect those native corn varieties, such as putting in spatial regulations or physical barriers or public awareness campaigns. And instead they've taken a trade restrictive measure. So I thought that was an argument that the US really stood out on. And just to go back to it was something that Kristy said, too, about the sequencing of events the panelists were asking specifically from the Mexican lawyers, were there are several drafts of the decree. Was there an agency that was tasked with writing the decree? Was it shared with other agencies? And the Mexican lawyers were not really able to answer with a lot of detail about the origin of the decree, which I felt was very indicative. And just as a reminder, the U.S. government has made several good arguments showing that Mexico's own regulatory agencies had approved a lot of biotech traits, especially from the corn side, only to reverse those policies immediately. So Mexico is acting kind of against their own regulatory system. So those are just a few things too that I saw from my lens, from the hearing. Dusty Weis So I think to summarize here, it seems fair to say that a lot of this particular effort originated with one person, Mexican President Lopez-Obrador, who issued the decree. And then everything that has just kind of followed that is kind of the tail wagging the dog, essentially. The arguments, the quote-unquote “science” are just trying to backfill and support that decree, and they're just throwing everything and the kitchen sink at it to try to do that. But I know Nancy touched on this a little bit earlier. Mexico now has a new presidential administration coming in. President Lopez-Obrador is on the way out. President Claudia Sheinbaum is on her way in. So I wanted to jump back to you, Kristy. President-elect Sheinbaum’s administration has made comments saying that they would drop their plan to phase out GM corn in animal feed, but keep up their efforts to ban GM corn in food products for human consumption. Now, given that Corn Refiners Association’s products are in the human consumption category, how are you feeling about this new tack from the incoming presidential administration? I can't imagine that this feels like much of a win from your perspective. Kristy Goodfellow Yeah, it's been interesting to see how quickly and specifically the new administration has come out with a policy on corn and corn trade. I can't say I understand the strategy behind that. But, you know, in the last couple of weeks, shortly after the new Secretary of Agriculture was named, he's conducted several interviews or talked very specifically about corn policy. You also had a tweet that had five very specific points on their corn policy. So that's been interesting. Specifically on the animal feed. I don't know if it actually constitutes a huge shift. I think it constitutes an acceptance of the reality that Mexico can't actually replace all of the imported corn without completely decimating their livestock sector, which is really reliant on that. What's in the decree is there's instructions to substitute over time. Effectively, the new secretary of agriculture is talking about continuing to develop production in Mexico, and they will continue importing and replace imports as they are able to with their own domestic production. It is reassuring that they don't envision doing something radical here, but... Dusty Weis Well, radical… or destructive. Kristy Goodfellow Destructive. Yeah, exactly. What is more concerning and seems like a bigger shift, is some statements that they've made alluding to continue to ban GM products for human consumption. And some of those comments have alluded to going beyond the current scope, which is pretty narrowly on dough and tortillas. As I said before, we're exporting a lot of refined corn products there. So expanding the scope of products could very quickly implicate a huge amount of trade. So it's something we are watching very closely. It's bringing a lot of uncertainty to companies producing not just in the United States, but in Mexico too. These are very integrated markets that depend on each other. So it's just introducing a lot of uncertainty right now. Dusty Weis Suffices to say, problem not solved. And there's even more riding on the results of this dispute hearing that took place in Mexico City here. But I want to go to Andrew next because the US Grains Council keeps up with the ag and trade policy all around the globe. Andrew, is there a concern that this could become trendy and could be something that we see other countries pursuing, trying to do something similar? Andrew Brandt Well thank you for that question, Dusty. That certainly is a concern. You know, we see biotech is used around the world. There are certain regions that have always been a little hesitant about it. But if Mexico is allowed to keep this policy or some version or some piece of it, I think it is very likely the activists who are running this, you know, anti-biotech playbook in Mexico will move on to another country within the region or, you know, go somewhere else like Africa and keep trying to chip away without using sound science at the use of, unfortunately, biotechnology. And that's very unfortunate. I mean, in the United States and Europe, we have very wealthy consumers, but that's not the case everywhere in the world. We see in Africa, people don't have the disposable income levels that wealthier parts of the world do. They would certainly benefit from access to biotech corn and some of these policies, the poorest among us, when you're trying to access protein for yourself, for your family, having access to biotech corn, which is typically the cheapest price corn you can get on the world market is very important. You know, if your food cost is lower, that frees up your income to, you know, put your kids in schools or invest in infrastructure or other assets, etc.. And so, yes, we definitely think they will try and run this playbook in other countries. And, there's an unfortunate downside if they would be successful, there’s certainly an unfortunate downside in our opinion, that has no basis in science, if they are going to unjustly attack biotechnology, which has been deemed safe and been safe in us for 30 years. Dusty Weis Well, and, Andrew, certainly the spread of this kind of protectionism is exactly what you don't want to see at the U.S. Grains Council. And in fact, the U.S Grains Council works around the world to maintain access to trade opportunities through a variety of international programs that they work on. And so thanks to a sponsorship by Corteva Agriscience, a member of the US Grains Council and a provider of seeds and crop protection, we're going to explore a little bit more about how USGC's programs play out on the ground in Mexico, and we're joined now by Heidi Bringenberg, the USGC’s Country Director for Mexico. Heidi, welcome. Heidi Bringenberg Thank you so much, Dusty. I would also like to thank Corteva and National Corn Growers Association for the invitation and the sponsorship today to talk about the council's work in Mexico. As you mentioned, Mexico is one of the council's 11 offices around the world, and we opened our doors actually back in 1982. So with that, we have decades of experience promoting U.S. agriculture, in particular the promotion of our products, which is U.S corn, sorghum and barley, and their co-products, including ethanol, into Mexico. Dusty Weis So tell us a little bit more than about the programs that you have at U.S. Grains Council and how you use those to support relations with Mexico and those particular grains. Heidi Bringenberg So our work over decades is heavily based on trust and deep relationships that we have established over these years of work. So the council has worked hand-in-hand with Mexican importers in the feed and livestock industry since well before NAFTA was even in place. And at that time we were doing primarily technology transfer work in the field with livestock and feed producers. From there, we worked with them through a free trading agreement when NAFTA came into place and through the implementation phases, and our work sort of shifted more to market education and importing quality standards of our products. And then today, we're operating in a very sophisticated trading environment, with USMCA fully in place. Mexico has been the largest market for our products for several years, and this year for corn in particular, we are on track for a record importing year of close to 22 million metric tons. So that's incredible. With NAFTA, just to give a little bit of comparison, that consumption didn't reach 2 million tons! So the council programs and work with importers has served not only to really accelerate the complementary relationship that we see with our end users around corn, but also it's been a celebration of livestock producer growth. And of course, Mexico's specialization in horticulture has also been able to thrive under NAFTA and now USMCA conditions. So we celebrate Mexico as a leader in food production. I think they rank 12th in the world now. And we recognize that this relationship is really a win win. North America trading bloc needs to continue cooperating together to maintain our reputation as one of the best agricultural trading blocs in the world, and of course, the guarantee of safe and economic food for our global customers. Dusty Weis When it comes to fostering trade relationships, I know a lot of that is the kind of behind the scenes work that doesn't necessarily get a lot of headlines or a lot of parades. So much of it is just showing up. It's being present, it's building relationships, it's finding ways to make things work for other people. But I'd love to hear some stories from your perspective about what it's like to do that kind of work, what it's like being on a trade mission and what you feel some of the really big notable wins have been. Heidi Bringenberg We at the council love to say that boots on the ground is why we're here, why we have these offices and physical presence, because the relationships are extremely important. And for a market like Mexico, where face to face still very much matters, you know, showing up, being there and representing our products physically is extremely important to our mission and why we're here. And I would say our membership of the US Grain Council plays a critical role in showing up. So it's not just me speaking for our products, but it's our members speaking for their products face to face now. So with that, our trade missions, I would say, are probably one of the most important components of of the work that I facilitate here. They can involve everything from meetings with major importers, with the feed and livestock associations, but also sometimes with government officials to provide education on how trade works, how it has typically worked, how it should work, and why it is so important for our economies and for our food security. For example, our MAIZALL mission to Mexico brought together corn producers from Brazil, Argentina and the United States. This group of producers together represents over 80% of corn exports, and the vast majority of those exports are GM product. And so having the producer voice is always extremely critical, especially when we're having meetings with folks in government or from organizations that potentially don't understand agriculture because their voice is the trusted voice. It was in this case during our MAIZALL mission, very important that Mexican government was able to hear from this coalition of producers on why they choose to plant GM corn, the benefits that they see on their operational level, and their commitment and the safety of these products, why they feed these products to their children, and why our countries are so committed to promoting science-based decision making for their customers. And they, during this meeting, were also able to offer straight away any research or data that Mexico would need to consider as they proceed with their policies. Dusty Weis Well, like you said, there's nothing like a boots on the ground perspective, and certainly that's what you're able to offer us from Mexico City here today. So we really appreciate your taking the time to share your perspective. Heidi Bringenberg, the USGS’s country Director for Mexico. Thank you to Corteva for inviting Heidi and for sponsoring this episode. Dusty Weis This is the Cobcast: Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association, and I'm Dusty Weis. We've discussed the Mexican decrees to ban GMO corn. The history how all these very capable and dedicated organizations are working to do something about it. But back to Nancy Martinez now, from the National Corn Growers Association. Nancy, what's at stake here? What would it mean if this ban did go into place? And what would the outcomes be for our farmers? Nancy Martinez Yeah. So if we look at the decree as it was originally written in February, and if all the elements were to be fully implemented, it would be detrimental for American corn growers. First, it would undermine the validated scientific studies that go back decades on the safety of biotech for human consumption. Farmers would lose market access to our top customer of U.S. corn, the white corn side. On the yellow corn side, if the administration would shift their view on that as well, it would be detrimental for us, as Andrew addressed already, you know, it would cause a ripple effect among other countries that could adopt policies against biotech for non-science based reasons. Right? So it'd be essentially a form of protectionism. This also impacts technology advancements. Innovators aren’t going to put forward new technologies on the market if they are concerned about market access. So there's really just a broad side fold of effects here if the ban would be implemented as was specified in that 2023 decree. Dusty Weis I think while this topic has certainly gotten a lot of news coverage lately, something that we see getting even more coverage right now is climate change and is environmental impacts and concerns that are raised. Nancy, I know you touched on the agronomic impacts that bans like this could have, but I think it's probably not going to shock anybody if I say right now that outside the agriculture community, most people aren't really well informed about what GMOs are or why they're important from an agronomic perspective. Can you recap that for us? How did genetic modification become such an essential part of agriculture? Nancy Martinez Yeah. Great question. Biotechnology is rife with benefits. That's why it's so widely adopted. So first, it makes crops more sustainable because it requires less inputs and less tillage. Reducing tillage improves soil health. So that is a huge win for sustainability. Biotech also makes crops more resilient to weather challenges and improves ability to withstand drought. So as there is uncertainty with precipitation, flooding, drought biotech can really be a way to address those issues. Biotech crops are also more cost effective and boost farmers’ yields, so they're designed to also maximize the presence of the desired nutrient and to put it in a final sort of summary, biotech has made our crops healthier, more sustainable and more resilient, and that's why they're so widely adopted in the United States. Dusty Weis Of course, you can point to the science all day, but if somebody read something on the internet last week that said differently, they might have a different opinion about it. The concerns about safety are still out there, and ultimately that's what's adding fuel to the fire on these restrictions. How do you reassure people that these products are safe? Nancy Martinez Yeah, there's overwhelming consensus from scientific experts and scientific authorities from around the world, not just from the United States, that GMOs and biotechnology is safe. There's been more than 1700 studies on GMO safety and hundreds that have been independently funded with zero incidences of harm to human health. But I think it's important to also note that the Mexican population has been consuming GM corn for decades, and only now has decided that it is not safe for consumption. So in the US as well, we have a rigorous and thorough regulatory review system designed with consumer safety in mind. So, you know, all of these factors together really just hammer home the message that the science is on our side with GMO safety. Dusty Weis So at this point, we're all looking ahead to the next step in the trade dispute process. And that's the final public report that'll be published in November. I know it's sort of anybody's guess as to what's going to happen, but if you had a magic eight ball, what do you think that we're going to see in that report, starting with you, Nancy? Nancy Martinez First, I would say that the science is on our side for the corn industry and for GM corn. So, you know, we are confident and supportive of the US positions. And we thought that they really made the best case possible evident in the public hearing. We're hopeful going into that final report and we look forward to it hopefully being on time, and we want the decision to be respected and we want action to happen after that decision. Dusty Weis Kristy, we’ll give you and the Corn Refiners last word on this one. What do you think happens when we see the report in November, and where do we go from there? Kristy Goodfellow I think these reports can be anyone's guess. You just don't know what's in these panelists’ heads, it's kind of a wild card and it's hard to make any specific predictions. I do agree with Nancy that the US argument seems very compelling here. My larger fear, and maybe suspicion is that this could very easily become a chronic bilateral issue that we have to deal with. And you've seen some of those other play out, like our issues with Canada Dairy or Mexico and Canada's issues with US country of origin labeling on beef. These issues get litigated, but they don't go away. They just manifest in different ways. And there’s just continue engagement for decades on these issues. And that's why I think it's really important that we try to fix this issue now so it doesn't become one of those issues. It has not been, Mexico has had policies in place for decades that have allowed these products. So we want to get back to that. We don't want to start down this path and making this a chronic issue that we have to deal with, an issue that adds this ongoing uncertainty to our businesses operating in North America. These kinds of disputes really influence people's perspective on trade. People aren't sitting around drinking their coffee and talking about the benefits of integrated markets and the wider benefits of trade. They're talking about these disputes because that's what's in the news, and that's what they're hearing tidbits from. And that doesn't help create the narrative that is true, that we benefit from these trade agreements. That's something I'm concerned about and a reason that we need to deal with this issue now and get it implemented in a way that it doesn't reappear in different versions. And as Nancy says, this is a huge setback for science, and that's coming at a time that we really need innovation and new technologies to help deal with these new issues that we're dealing with now related to supply chain resilience and climate change and other environmental problems that we're having. So it's really a setback for science. So I hope we can overcome this in the context of the dispute and move on in a positive and constructive way. Dusty Weis Right. At the end of the day, we've got a world to feed and we've got a climate to protect and growers the world over, not just here in America, but they want to use the best tools that are available to them. And these are the tools that are at the top of the toolbox, and they're going to need them to be able to continue to feed, fuel, produce fiber for the world. So I want to thank each one of you for taking the time to speak with us here. It's been a really informative discussion and we appreciate your making the time. I'm sure we'll have an update for more news coming up in November here. But just to recap once again, everybody that we've had in this episode, it has been an all-hands effort. Andrew Brandt, the director of trade policy for the U.S. Grains Council, Kristy Goodfellow, the vice president of trade and industry affairs for the Corn Refiners Association. And Nancy Martinez, NCGA's director of public policy, trade and biotechnology. Thank you all so much for joining us here on the Cobcast. And thank you for listening.

    "content": "A corn grower leader from Minnesota told the House Agriculture Committee today that farmers in her state and across the country need the support of a reauthorized and strengthened farm bill. The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and state corn-affiliated associations are continuing to push for an improved farm bill this year. “Unless conditions change, I believe we’re heading into a perfect storm, a storm that I don’t think will be fully appreciated until early next year when farmers try to get loans but are unable to do so because they cannot demonstrate the ability to cash flow,” Minnesota Corn Growers President Dana Allen-Tully, Ph.D., told the committee as she testified about the state of the agricultural economy. While farmers can feed and fuel the economy, she said, they need a strong farm bill that will assist when the chips are down. “We have to have policies in place that reflect the realities of farming today,” Allen-Tully said. The stakes of farming are so incredibly high – higher than I ever remember them to be. We are putting everything we have on the line every single year for very thin and oftentimes negative margins.” Both Allen-Tully and National Corn Growers Association President Harold Wolle have published op-eds in recent weeks highlighting corn growers’ priorities and calling for action on the farm bill. “The farm bill is so important to growers on every front,” Wolle wrote in a recent op-ed. “USDA programs are particularly crucial to open and cultivate foreign markets and for a safety net for farmers during hard economic times.” Last week, NCGA took over 200 corn growers to Capitol Hill to push for action on the farm bill. While the House Agriculture Committee has marked up its version of the legislation, the Senate committee and both chambers need to come together to pass the bill into law.",

    "content": "The U.S. has made a strong case in the dispute with Mexico over genetically engineered corn under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a top official in the Biden administration told farmers this week during remarks at the National Corn Growers Association’s Corn Congress meeting in Washington, D.C. “This is something we will not rest until we get done,” said Ambassador Doug McKalip who serves as the chief agricultural negotiator in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. “I know this is critically important, not just for corn growers, but frankly, farmers of all kinds. They say ‘we cannot allow trading partners to play loose with the science. If they can do it with corn, they can do it with anything.’” McKalip said both U.S. and Mexican officials were given questions in writing by the panel considering the matter and both have responded. He said a decision is expected this fall. McKalip said USTR is working on addressing unfair trade practices with Brazil and, that it has addressed burdensome tariffs from governments in South Asia. “We have continued to be frustrated by the 18% tariffs that Brazil has placed on ethanol,” McKalip noted. “Today, we still do not have one U.S. biofuel company that has qualified for the Brazilian program.” McKalip said USTR values trade with China but is also focused on diversifying its Asian trade portfolio. He said the U.S. is looking at cultivating markets in Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, among other countries. Corn growers have worked closely with Ambassador McKalip and USTR. After Mexico announced its intent to block imports of genetically engineered corn, NCGA and corn grower leaders sounded the alarm. USTR worked with corn growers as it filed a dispute settlement case on the issue under the USMCA. Corn Congress meets every summer in the nation’s capital to vote on policy positions, elect new board members and to hear from the nation’s top leaders.",

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) with its prestigious President’s Award today during its summer Corn Congress meeting in Washington, D.C. “Sen. Klobuchar is a tireless advocate for corn growers,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “She thoroughly understands the agricultural community and rural America and is always at the forefront championing our issues. It is my pleasure and distinct honor to recognize the senator and fellow Minnesotan with this award.” Klobuchar has spent years in the Senate pushing for legislation important to corn growers and other farmers. In recent years she has promoted legislation that would allow consumers greater access to higher blends of ethanol. She has also been a forceful advocate for eliminating trade barriers that negatively impact farmers and she is working to pass a farm bill that will reflect corn grower priorities. “America is stronger because of you,” Klobuchar said during a taped video address to NCGA members and delegates. “That’s why I am fighting in Washington to give you the support you need and deserve.” The NCGA President’s Award, one of the organization’s highest honors, is given each year to a recipient chosen by the organization’s board president. Wolle and Klobuchar have worked together for years at the state and national level on corn grower policy and legislation. NCGA voting delegates meet twice a year during Corn Congress meetings to debate the organization’s policies and vote on new board members for the organization.

    "title": "NCGA, Joined by Other Ag Groups, Warns Commerce on Herbicide Tariffs",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association, joined by five other commodity groups, sent a letter to Department of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo asking her to consider the impacts on farmers as she reviews a petition by the agricultural chemical company Corteva that would place duties on imports of the herbicide 2,4-D. “Restricting imports of 2,4-D will have wide-ranging consequences for farmers,” the letter said. “American farmers cannot solely rely on Corteva, which is the only domestic supplier of 2,4-D, because there is not enough supply to meet demand.” The letter also said that, if granted, the petition would cause availability shortages and hamper the ability of growers to be successful. “Restricting the availability of 2,4-D will be very harmful at a time when farmers are grappling with rising input costs and low commodity prices,” the letter said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects total farm production cash expenses for 2024 at a record-high level. Concurrently, crop values are declining. USDA predicts total cash receipts in nominal value for crops in 2024 will be 11.7% lower than in 2022. “Farmers are unable to incur additional costs in what is already a period of tight margins,” the letter said. “This case has the potential to forcibly cause farmers to cut budgets, which will impact their ability to have successful yields and will further disrupt the economic health of local economies.” Other groups signing the letter were the American Soybean Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Barley Growers Association, National Sorghum Producers and U.S. Durum Growers Association. The Department of Commerce is expected to issue the preliminary duty rates in September. Read the Letter",

    "content": "Corn growers were responsible for a $151 billion boost to the U.S. economy in 2023, according to a new report released this week by the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA). The report, entitled NCGA Economic Contribution Study for 2023, looked at a number of ways in which corn growers shaped the economy, including economic output, contributions to the gross domestic product, tax revenues, labor income and employment statistics. “This report highlights the crucial role America’s corn growers play in our nation’s agricultural and economic value chain,” said NCGA Lead Economist Krista Swanson who authored the analysis. \"The data show that growers remain deeply rooted in rural America where they serve as pillars of economic growth. They work to foster technological innovation, expand commercial opportunities, advance free trade, build the bioeconomy, and feed a hungry world.” In 2023 U.S. corn farmers produced 15.3 billion bushels of corn, valued at $73.9 billion, across 289,382 farms dedicated to growing corn for grain, according to the report. Corn grower production directly contributed $20.7 billion to the gross domestic product and provided $12 billion in labor wages and benefits. The economic impact of corn farming extended across 524 different industry sectors in all 50 states, reinforcing its broad influence on the national economy. The report comes as corn prices have dropped and corn growers face many challenges, including higher input costs, tariffs and some trade barriers. NCGA leaders say the report should serve as a reminder to policymakers that corn grower contributions are important. “The data in this report illustrate the critical role farmers play in shaping the U.S. economy,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “Yet, we are facing many challenges that need to be addressed by America’s policymakers. Our message to Congress is to act on legislative and regulatory issues, like the farm bill, that will support our work.” The study relied on IMPLAN, an economic analysis software, to calculate the direct, indirect, and induced impact of corn farming for grain production on the U.S. economy at the state and national level.",

The program offers a network for women and their male allies, providing mentorships and creating a pipeline of female leaders for NCGA and other agricultural organizations. Participants at the most recent event noted that they were able to grow their leadership, communication, and professional skills while networking with others who are invested in elevating women’s voices in agricultural leadership. “The Women & Mentors Program has inspired me to continue growing as a leader while supporting new and emerging leaders,” said Joan Ruskamp, a participant from Nebraska. “Most importantly, this retreat builds a growing network of women supporting one another no matter what role each of us has in agriculture.” Participants were encouraged to “Quiet their Inner Critic” during the first session with helpful tips from Randi Braun, an author, consultant, executive coach, and speaker. Randi explained how identifying and quieting negative self-talk can help participants feel more confident, prepared, and empowered. Other presenters taught workshops on personal and professional branding, following one’s leadership journey, and communication differences. On the second day, attendees heard presentations about merchandising and how to pursue goals while upholding obligations. These sessions, led by industry leaders, sparked thoughtful conversation and new insight for participants. The retreat ended with attendees meeting their new mentorship cohorts, groups based on similar interests and goals. These networks provide valuable connections and new opportunities for participants as they work towards their leadership and career goals. NCGA would like to thank the sponsors that made this program possible: Syngenta, FMC, Bayer, and John Deere.",

    "content": "Officials from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative hammered arguments made by Mexican representatives this week during oral arguments over Mexico’s ban on imports of genetically modified corn used in some food products. The ban was issued in early 2023. USTR filed a dispute settlement under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement over the issue in August of that year after the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and state corn groups spent months pushing for action. “The science overwhelmingly shows that genetically modified corn is safe for consumers and does not harm native plants,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “U.S. officials did an excellent job of making their case, and more importantly they successfully argued that the Mexican government does not have the scientific evidence to support its actions or claims.” During the hearing, which was held on Wednesday and Thursday in Mexico City, U.S. officials made several convincing arguments, according to Wolle, including that Mexico did not conduct a risk assessment to support its claims and the documentation they provided was over 20 years old and lacked scientific rigor. They also argued that Mexico’s regulatory agencies have previously determined that genetically modified corn is safe for use and this abrupt deviation from those determinations is a way to restrict trade and target imports. The panel hearing the case is expected to render a decision toward the end of November.",

    "title": "NCGA Joins Other Organizations in Filing Latest Lawsuit Challenging Administrations Vehicle Mandates",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and the Texas Corn Producers Association (TCPA), along with other groups, filed a lawsuit today in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard for model year 2027-2032 passenger cars and light-duty trucks. The CAFE rule mandates stringent new standards that appear designed to phase out liquid fuel-powered vehicles. Today’s filing follows two recent lawsuits led by NCGA, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Petroleum Institute and auto dealerships challenging the EPA’s light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle rulemakings. “Once again, we have a federal agency trying to force a one-size-fits-all solution on the American consumer through the final NHTSA CAFE rule and fuel efficiency standard, which favors electric vehicles,” said Minnesota farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Harold Wolle. “Because ethanol effectively lowers greenhouse gas emissions and combats climate change, it accounts for one-third of corn growers’ demand. We are concerned that NHTSA could be putting the country on the path to eliminating this demand, which would be a major financial blow to corn growers.” The Texas Corn Producers Association also weighed in on the development. “On behalf of Texas corn farmers – and family farms across the nation, TCPA is joining this petition on the NHTSA CAFE final rule that threatens existing fuel infrastructure, including ethanol,” said TCPA President Jim Sugarek. “Not only does this rule endanger the ethanol demand that is important to our corn farmers’ markets, it poses a risk to the liquid fuel industry as a whole. We simply can’t allow a federal agency to dictate rules that jeopardize the viability of both the agriculture and energy sectors that drive the Texas economy.” The American Petroleum Institute, American Farm Bureau Federation, Texas Farm Bureau and a group of six auto dealers representing sixteen brands and collectively operating dozens of dealerships in major markets across the country joined NCGA as co-petitioners in today’s lawsuit. NHTSA’s final CAFE rule for passenger cars and light trucks requires passenger cars to reach 66.4 miles per gallon by 2032 and light trucks to 46.2 MPG, an overall fleet fuel economy average of 51.4 MPG. Comparatively, current CAFE standards for model years 2021-2026 require an overall average of 40 MPG by 2026.",

    "title": "NCGA, AFBF and Coalition Partners File Lawsuit to Stop EPAs Emissions Rule for New Heavy-Duty Vehicles",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association, American Farm Bureau Federation and the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association joined the American Petroleum Institute today in filing a lawsuit in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s heavy-duty vehicle emissions standards for model years 2027-2032. The groups said EPA exceeded its congressional authority with the regulation with targets that rely too heavily on electrification and do not fully appreciate the role low-carbon fuels like ethanol play in the transportation sector. “EPA has tried to impose a one-size-fits-all approach to addressing climate change by prioritizing electric vehicles over other climate remedies like corn ethanol,” said Minnesota farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Harold Wolle. “But while it could take decades to get enough electric vehicles on the road to make a dent in GHG emissions, lower carbon fuels such as ethanol are critical and effective climate tools that are available now. Ethanol is not only critical in the climate fight, but it also saves consumers money at the pump while benefiting America’s rural economies. We look forward to making this case in court.” The groups also noted that EPA’s standard will put America’s farmers and their livestock at risk. “Farmers rely on heavy-duty trucks to transport livestock long distances, and they choose the most efficient routes to ensure the animals in their care remain on the vehicle for as little time as possible,” said American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall. “Unfortunately, heavy-duty vehicles that are powered by batteries have short ranges and require hours to charge. Impractical regulations will extend the amount of time on the road, putting the health and safety of drivers and livestock at risk if they need to stop for long periods of time to charge.” The groups further emphasized the impact the agency’s standards would have on America’s supply chain and on its small-business truckers. “Small business truckers makeup 96% of trucking and could be regulated out of existence if the EPA’s unworkable heavy-duty rule comes into effect,” said Todd Spencer, president, Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association. “This rule would devastate the reliability of America’s supply chain and ultimately increase costs for consumers. Mom-and-pop trucking businesses would be suffocated by the sheer cost and operational challenges of effectively mandating zero-emission trucks, but this administration appears intent on forcing through its deluge of misguided environmental mandates. As the voice of over 150,000 small-business truckers, we owe it to our members and every small-business trucker in America to leave no stone unturned in fighting these radical environmental policies.” Leaders at API highlighted the repercussions EPA’s standard will have on consumers. “Today, we are standing up for consumers who rely on trucks to deliver the goods they use every single day,” said API Senior Vice President and General Counsel Ryan Meyers. “The EPA is forcing a switch to technology that simply does not presently exist for these kinds of vehicles – and even if it were someday possible, it will almost certainly have consequences for your average American. This is sadly yet another example of this administration pushing unpopular policy mandates that lack statutory authority, and we look forward to holding them accountable in court.” In March, the Biden administration finalized new federal emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles (including commercial vehicles). In the final rule, EPA projects that there would need to be significant deployment of zero-emission vehicles throughout the heavy-duty fleet to meet emissions standards. For example, over 40% of vocational vehicles (work trucks) would need to be zero-emission vehicles by model year 2032. Additionally, long-haul tractors (semi-trucks), which currently have no ZEV deployment, would need to go from zero percent today to 25% of the fleet by model year 2032.",

Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s light-duty and medium-duty vehicle emissions standards for model years 2027-2032. The groups said EPA exceeded its congressional authority with the regulation and rendered a decision that values one tool for fighting climate change over others. “By approving tailpipe standards that focus exclusively on electric vehicles, EPA has ignored the proven benefits corn ethanol offers in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combatting climate change,” Minnesota farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Harold Wolle said. “While it could take decades to get enough electric vehicles on the road to significantly lower GHG emissions, ethanol is a critical and effective climate solution that is available now.

Wolle said growers were appreciative of Rep. Max Miller (R-Ohio) for offering an amendment on sustainable aviation fuel that was adopted by the committee. He also thanked Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) for leading and offering an amendment requiring a mandatory base acre update that would better reflect corn growers priorities for commodity program eligibility. Wolle said corn growers stand ready to provide additional feedback to the House and Senate Agriculture Committees and all members of Congress as the legislative process moves forward. “For the farm bill to be successfully reauthorized this year, there will ultimately need to be broad support from members of both parties,” Wolle noted. NCGA sent a letter to House Agriculture Committee members earlier this week reflecting on the Farm, Food, and National Security Act provisions important to corn growers.

    "content": "The U.S. International Trade Commission today agreed to advance a petition by Corteva Agribusiness to place anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of the herbicide 2,4-D shipped from China and India. The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) said the decision will impact farmers. “We are disappointed that ITC did not listen to the feedback from farmers about how harmful these tariffs could be to rural America,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “Corn prices are already low and input costs have been rising. This decision will only compound our problems.” Six of the nation’s major commodity groups, including the National Corn Growers Association, sent a letter to the U.S. International Trade Commission in April encouraging it to vote against advancing a petition. Growers have said the imports covered by this case are the major sources of supply other than Corteva, which is the only U.S. manufacturer, and that America’s farmers cannot rely upon a sole domestic supplier of 2,4-D to meet nearly all the market’s needs. Duties on 2,4-D imports from the two countries would intensify what is already a difficult period for many growers as key input costs continue to increase. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is projecting record-high farm production cash expenses for 2024. At the same time, crop values are declining. USDA projects total cash receipts for crops in 2024 will be 11.7% lower than 2022.

Commerce’s actions come after the domestic fertilizer company Mosaic requested action from the agency in 2023 over an import dispute with another multi-national company. “The price of corn has dropped, and input costs are already high, so the Commerce Department’s decision is the last thing farmers need,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “If fertilizers continue to go up in price and are hard to secure, farmers will only have Mosaic and the Commerce Department to thank.” The proposed new rate would be the final retroactive tariff for 2022 imports and serve as the new provisional rate required to be deposited with U.S. Customs for imports from November 2024 and onward until the conclusion of the next administrative review, if requested. NCGA has spent the last two years sounding the alarms on the issue and lobbying to lower the tariffs or eliminate them altogether.",

    "title": "Corn Growers Disappointed in GREET Model Update",
    "content": "An announcement this week by the U.S. Department of Treasury regarding the final guidance on eligibility for the Sustainable Aviation Fuel tax credits enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act was met with concern from leaders at the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) who say they are now committed to ensuring that the updated guidelines for the credit are vastly improved. NCGA raised specific issues with the changes Treasury made to the Department of Energy’s GREET model, which is used to measure greenhouse gas emissions and will be a crucial mechanism in determining who receives the tax credit. Corn grower leaders said they are particularly troubled that the updated model requires farmers to bundle the use of no-till practices, enhanced efficiency fertilizers and cover crops for their grain to meet the standards now required to qualify for the tax credit. “We are deeply disappointed that this updated model requires farmers to implement environmental practices that are not practical for all acres of the large and varied geographic region in which corn is grown,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “This requirement in GREET will significantly hinder the chances corn growers have in accessing the sustainable aviation fuel market, even as higher blends of corn ethanol offer great promise in the country’s fight against greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.” Wolle noted that cover crops can be difficult, if not impossible, to grow in dryer climates, making the bundling requirement extremely unreasonable. He also noted that growers should be able to implement their own environmental practices. “As corn growers, we already understand the environmental practices that work best for our growing conditions and climate, so it is not necessary for the government to dictate specifically how we reach an emissions reduction goal,” Wolle said. “Farmers are going to have different methods depending on a variety of factors, including where their farms are located.” The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, allocates tax credits for biofuels that can demonstrate that they cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% or more. After the law was passed, Treasury and EPA were charged with choosing a model that would measure emissions throughout the life of biofuels. NCGA has been at the forefront of this issue, making a case about how ethanol can help the aviation sector meet the nation’s environmental goals. But recent developments have made growers question the Biden administration’s commitment to using ethanol as a climate solution. “President Biden has repeatedly said that biofuels will play an important role in the decarbonization of the transportation sector,” Wolle said. “Yet, this announcement and the recently finalized Multi-Pollutant Rule issued by the EPA have left corn growers across the country grasping for ideas on just how they will be able to contribute to this effort.” Wolle said NCGA and corn growers across the country will increase their advocacy efforts to improve the changes Treasury made to the GREET model as the Biden administration focuses on the next phase of the Inflation Reduction Act for passenger vehicles, referred to as the 45Z tax credit. The 45Z tax credit will take effect at the beginning of 2025. As part of the law, the aviation tax credit will be folded into the 45Z tax credit beginning on January 1, 2025. NCGA has been concerned about the delays with the release of the sustainable aviation fuel guidance because the regulatory uncertainty is beginning to impact fuel delivery contracts already being negotiated for January of next year.",

    "title": "Corn Growers Applaud EPA for Allowing Access to Higher Blends of Ethanol During Summer Months",
    "content": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced today that it will use its existing authority to prevent drivers from losing access to lower-cost and lower-emission E15, a higher ethanol blend often marketed as Unleaded 88. The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and state corn grower organizations, which have advocated for the move, praised the decision “This waiver is good news for corn growers and those in rural America who will benefit economically from this decision and for consumers who will save money at the pump during a busy travel season,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “We are deeply appreciative of EPA Administrator Regan, President Biden and our congressional allies for all their work on this issue.” Under current policy, E15 cannot be sold at terminals beginning on May 1 and at retail stations starting on June 1. But the Clean Air Act gives EPA authority to temporarily waive these requirements to address pressing concerns, such as fuel shortages. The war in Ukraine, disruptions to key trade routes and inflation have raised concerns among many in the Biden administration and in Congress about high gas prices and energy security. Higher blends of ethanol have been shown to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions while lowering the price of fuels and the biofuels reduce America’s need for foreign oil. In February, EPA approved a petition from eight Midwestern governors allowing their states to sell E15. But since that decision is not effective until summer 2025 and only impacts a handful of states, corn grower leaders had to quickly mobilize and work with EPA to get today’s waiver in motion. NCGA is working with allies, including the petroleum industry, on federal legislation that would provide permanent, year-round access to E15.",

    "title": "Six National Commodity Groups Call on U.S. International Trade Commission to Nix Petition Related to Duties on Herbicides",
    "content": "Six of the nation’s major commodity groups, including the National Corn Growers Association, sent a letter to the U.S. International Trade Commission today encouraging it to vote negative in advancing a petition by Corteva Agribusiness to place antidumping and countervailing duties on imports of the herbicide 2,4-D shipped from India and China. The letter said if the U.S. International Trade Commission votes to continue the case beyond the preliminary stage, farmers across the country could soon find it difficult to access critical supplies. The letter, signed by leaders from the American Soybean Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Barley Growers Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Sorghum Producers and the U.S. Durum Growers Association, expressed concerns that the petition could hinder imports and cause herbicide shortages. “The imports covered by this case are the large majority of sources of supply other than Corteva, which is the only U.S. supplier,” the letter said. “To put it simply, America’s farmers cannot rely upon a sole domestic supplier of 2,4-D to meet nearly all the market’s needs, and imports are needed to meet the majority of market needs.” Duties on 2,4-D imports from the two countries would intensify what is already a difficult period for many growers as key input costs continue to increase. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is projecting record high farm production cash expenses for 2024. At the same time, crop values are declining. USDA projects total cash receipts for crops in 2024 will be 11.7% lower than 2022. The letter noted that the petition, which seeks to limit imports of a critical farm input, only makes a rough environment even more challenging. “There is no way for farmers to make up for the additional costs, as we are price takers, not makers, in selling crops,” the leaders said. “If this case moves forward, we will be forced to make budget cuts that can impact our operations as well as our local economies. To put it simply, the weight of a dispute between multinational companies would fall directly on the shoulders of growers.” The ITC is scheduled to vote on its preliminary determination in this case on May 17, 2024.

    "content": "National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) First Vice President Kenneth Hartman Jr. joined a press conference on Capitol Hill today to offer corn growers’ support of legislation to make crop insurance more affordable for producers through the farm bill. The press conference centered around today’s introduction of the Federal Agriculture Risk Management Enhancement and Resilience Act, sponsored by Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.). The FARMER Act has been endorsed by NCGA. “Increasing the affordability of crop insurance is a top priority for our farmers,” said Hartman. “We applaud Sen. Hoeven and his colleagues’ efforts in ensuring that these risk management tools continue to be improved and meet the challenges producers face today.” The legislation seeks to improve federal crop insurance affordability by increasing support for the highest levels of yield and revenue coverage and enhancing the Supplemental Coverage Option. Original cosponsors include several members of the Senate Agriculture Committee, including Ranking Member Sen. Boozman (R-Ark.), as well as Sens. Ernst (R-Iowa), Fischer (R-Neb.), Grassley (R-Iowa), Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) and Marshall (R-Kan.).

    "title": "NCGA Leader Warns International Trade Commission Against Placing Duties on Imports of Key Herbicide",
    "content": "Saying growers need reliable access to essential farming tools, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) President Harold Wolle warned the U.S. International Trade Commission today of the consequences for America’s farmers if the agency grants a petition to levy tariffs on imported 2,4-D, an often-used herbicide that has been on the market for decades. “The scenario under consideration has the potential to limit imports of an important product, raise its price, and create a supply shortage, all while raising the cost of production in an already tight market,” Wolle said. “Farmers are price takers, not makers in selling our commodities, and closely managing our production costs is crucial to our success. Thus, tariffs on these products would create an even more difficult economic scenario for me, my family, and the farmers I represent.” Wolle’s testimony comes after Corteva Inc. filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions with the ITC on March 14 over India and China’s trade practices involving the herbicide. Herbicides are one of the most significant inputs for raising crops, and 2,4-D-based products are widely used herbicides for corn and soybeans. NCGA, citing data showing that the bulk of imported 2,4-D comes from Asia, said the duties on these products could place a hardship on America’s growers who may struggle to gain access to the herbicide or see prices for the product become virtually unaffordable. The petition couldn’t come at a worse time, Wolle noted, as the price of corn has declined by more than 40% over the last two years, and the average cost of producing corn was higher than the average selling price of corn in 2023. Farmers are expecting that margin of loss to be even worse in 2024—even before taking this new trade case into account. NCGA noted companies like Corteva Inc. provide valuable innovations to farmers but that it is important that growers have access to imported products as well. “We are thankful companies like Corteva have invested in new technologies, including seed traits and herbicides, that allow us to continue producing more effectively and efficiently every year,” said Wolle. “However, farmers simply cannot rely upon a sole supplier for nearly all of our 2,4-D needs. That will undoubtedly lead to shortages and delays in an industry that must have timely delivery.” Within the next 45 days, the ITC will determine if there is a reasonable indication that the imports are injuring or threatening to injure the U.S. industry. If the ITC finds that this standard is met, the cases will move to the Department of Commerce, which will calculate the preliminary anti-dumping and countervailing duty margins. READ THE TESTIMONY",

    "content": "At the Advanced Bioeconomy Leadership Conference (ABLC) in Washington D.C., the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) once again sponsored and facilitated a special session, outlining the national incentive for biobased chemicals and renewable materials that NCGA, along with Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) and other partners have been working on. The panel was moderated by Sarah McKay, NCGA Market Development Director, and participants included John Torres, Director, Federal Government Relations at BIO, Ken Rubin, president, Gross-Wen Technologies, and Manning Feraci, Principal, Playmaker Strategies. The panel highlighted the efforts to date to support industrial biotechnology and develop for a national incentive for biobased products. Rubin also shared Gross-Wen’s technology and his perspective on how this national incentive will benefit a variety of agricultural feedstocks, a key component of the national incentive. McKay emphasized the value and sustainability of corn as an industrial feedstock and how utilizing corn addresses key areas of importance for the public as it relates to industrial biotechnology. Further, the panel had a robust Q&A session with the audience on programs and policies, including a detailed overview of the national incentive for biobased materials and what technologies would qualify. “U.S. corn farmers continue to produce an affordable, high-quality and reliable crop each year,” said McKay. “That crop can be turned into more than just food, feed and fuel. The corn kernel can be utilized in so many ways, which is why we focus on new uses and corn as an industrial feedstock. NCGA is working on this national incentive with partners across the agricultural and biotech industry to help a variety of new technologies overcome barriers to commercialization so they can begin to grind more corn.” NCGA continues work in the new uses and industrial feedstock space through the Consider Corn Challenge, Radicle Challenge, and state and national New Uses Consortium. NCGA also works to accelerate new uses through a partnership with DigestData, continued conversations with government agencies like the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO), and engagement with the airline community and technology providers to make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) a reality.

    "content": "Growers who limited their nitrogen application still achieved incredible results. Now entering its 60th year, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) Corn Yield Contest is an institution in the agriculture world. Growers from all across the country can compete against one another to see who can coax the most bushels per acre out of their ground, blending tried-and-true techniques with new and emerging practices to maximize their production. Last year, NCGA launched a new pilot class for the contest, the first in its history to limit an input in the hunt for high corn yields. So in this episode of the Cobcast, we're discussing the Nitrogen Management Pilot Class of the Corn Yield Contest with Nick Preissler, the first-ever winner of the class, and Jim Isermann, an agronomist working with the NCGA to design rules for the class. Together we'll discuss the impetus behind the development of the class, the challenges and opportunities it presents and the specific limitations set for nitrogen usage. Nick will share what he learned on his operation in Aurora, Nebraska, and what other growers can take away from his experience.

It's definitely looked to across the industry as one of the Cadillac programs. Nick Preissler It kind of fit right in line with our goals where we were trying to be as efficient as possible with our nitrogen. We kind of saw it as an opportunity to see what we could do against others. Dusty Weis Hello and welcome to the Cobcast, inside the grind with the National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the D.C. Beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you're following the show on your favorite podcast app and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at NCGA.com. I'm Dusty Weis, and in this episode, we're going to take a closer look at NCGA’s corn yield contest, about to begin its 60th year. Last year NCGA launched a new pilot class for the contest, the first of its kind in the contest's history to limit an input in the hunt for high corn yields. We'll learn why this class sparked interest among growers last year, what lessons were learned and why it's an important step forward for the contest. And we're joined today by Nick Preissler, a grower from Aurora, Nebraska, and the first ever winner of the corn yield contest nitrogen management pilot class, and Jim Isermann, an agronomist working with NCGA who led the way to design this year's contest. So welcome to the podcast, Nick and Jim. Nick Preissler Yeah, thanks for having us, Dusty. Dusty Weis And of course, Nick, congratulations, first and foremost. Hats off for being the inaugural winner of the contest here. I'm going to quote Simon Sinek to get started here, but I want to start with the why. Jim, what was the impetus behind the development of this class in the contest? Jim Isermann Well, as you've mentioned, the corn yield contest has been very successful, having gone on for 60 years now. That's a very long period of time for something like this to continue and one of the major keys to its success is it's been both fairly simple and fairly consistent over that time frame. It's been all about kind of maximizing your bushels per acre and kind of getting there whichever way you can, within reason, obviously. But when we started to think about kind of next steps for the contest, obviously there's a lot of concerns out there over things such as economics, the environmental impact, sustainability. So looking into something that's been so successful, such as the corn yield contest, that's kind of an avenue for some of those things to be brought to farmers and to be highlighted was a major interest. You've got thousands of farmers involved with this corn yield contest. It's definitely looked to across the industry as kind of one of the Cadillac programs. Lots of information gets highlighted. The farmers who win get highlighted. So it seemed like a really good opportunity. The program itself, the contest has always kind of highlighted the maximum potential for corn where we get to see just, you know, some really huge yields. We get to see what corn can really do when we put all the management, all the inputs to it to kind of give us that top end look at what the potential yield could be, which has been just amazing. I think even this last year, we saw a new record set at 623 bushels, I believe, by David Hula. So that's been just, you know, some huge numbers coming out of the corn yield contest. Dusty Weis David Hula, we should call out, was actually the guest on this podcast a couple of years ago, episode 33. This past victory for David was that his fifth or his sixth? Because when I talked to him two years ago, he'd already won it four times. Jim Isermann Well, I know he's been a perennial winner, so yeah, the name is definitely fairly common out there. When we think about high yielding corn. Dusty Weis Guy is a legend out in Virginia. Absolutely. And one of the oldest farms in America to boot, too. So where did the idea come from then for the new class here, Jim? Jim Isermann I mean, the yields are really impressive, but, you know, coming back to what are some of the real world situations that we're facing, both in the industry as an association. But what are farmers facing? What are farmers asking for and why yield is important. We all know there's more to life than just yield, or the yield needs to be economic. So we talk a lot about ROI. What's our return on the investment or to raising a corn crop? We also need to look at the sustainability of it and we need to look at the environmental impact. So as we thought about what that new challenge could be for growers, we really fell back to that idea of, well, maybe we need to start limiting something to kind of not just concentrate in terms of yield, but bring it down to something where we can really concentrate on the economics and the environment and we really fall back on nitrogen. Nitrogen made a lot of sense as part of that next step. We know that nitrogen is extremely important in raising a corn crop. We know that we can elevate yields by applying nitrogen and we can even do that kind of beyond the point of it being profitable. So nitrogen is certainly one of those ones that even though we can continue to add nitrogen and get a higher yields, there's kind of an economic return involved there. At the same time, it's very expensive for farmers to put on their fields. It takes a lot of energy to produce and if it isn't managed properly in a field, we can lose it to our waterways and it can become an environmental concern. Dusty Weis So that's kind of the look from the top. Why NCGA was interested in incorporating that in. But from the perspective of someone with their boots in the dirt, Nick, I've got to ask, what did you first think when you heard about this new idea from NCGA and the yield contest? Nick Preissler Yeah, so we were definitely excited to hear about this new class. I have to thank. My local seed dealer approached us when he found out about the class. He kind of thought it would be a really good fit on our farm with what we were already doing. We agreed and it kind of fit right in line with our goals where we were trying to be as efficient as possible with our nitrogen across all of our acres. So we kind of saw it as an opportunity to see what we could do against others and not really change our practices compared to our whole farm. Dusty Weis Brass tacks, Jim, let's talk about the specifics of the pilot class and how you arrived at where you did for setting those limits. Jim Isermann Well, it took a little time because we kind of went down a number of different roads as to how we actually wanted to approach this. You know, early on, talking to members of the Corn Board, past participants, did we want to look at more of a ROI type trial that we want to look at being involved with soil testing. But again, coming back to keeping it simple, if we want to look at inputs that are put on a field, those can vary a lot in terms of their cost and expense. Land values are so much that comes together in terms of talking about the economics and the ROI. We really decided that wasn't feasible to go down the path at a national level trying to take a look at those kind of things that can vary so much so centered on that idea of nitrogen bouncing around some ideas in terms of, well, do we want to take into account the nitrogen that's in the soil. We started to make the process both a little more complicated, but we also had some things in mind that we wanted out of this contest in terms of what are we encouraging, you know, what are we really challenging farmers on? And so it really kind of started to make sense that we just needed to kind of put a limit and a cap on the nitrogen. We needed to come up with a rate that would both challenge farmers and yet also be high enough that could give those good yields. So we didn't necessarily want to cut things down to a point where we're impacting yields for a lot of growers. There's an economic point that we need to highlight on and Nick kind of mentioned that he really didn't change things a whole lot when he joined this program. Right. He was already paying a lot of attention to that. So already achieving those high yields. We kind of referenced what's known as the maximum return to nitrogen. There's a calculator online that is applicable to Midwestern states where there's been a lot of research involved or they're really looking at the return in terms of yield. So they're actually taking in yield and they're adding in the idea of the cost of nitrogen and they're adding in the expected cost of corn to really get what that economic threshold would be for applying nitrogen, recognizing that there's a point that as we continue to go up, we can still increase yield, but we're doing it at a cost that is higher than that improvement. So we ended up with that 180 pounds, wanting to keep it as simple as we could. We decided that we didn't necessarily want to try to measure the nitrogen that's already in the soil, but we did want to restrict some of the things that are going on in terms of what has been previous crops, looking at some of the nitrogen that's been applied previously. So for the 1 80 units, we're looking at basically everything you're applying in that crop year for that corn. So we're looking at all the synthetics, we're looking at manure applications, any compost, anything like that you might have applied. We also putting some limitations on what that previous year could have been. So for example, we're not allowing alfalfa to be the crop ahead of the corn crop. Number one, this is already kind of an accepted practice. It's a good practice. You know, we don't necessarily want to discourage it, but we know that alfalfa can provide all the nitrogen necessary for a corn crop. And so that's not really the spirit of the program to see somebody apply an additional 180 units to add to a soil that already has enough nitrogen out there. Previous years, we do have just kind of a very general cap on the amount of nitrogen that can be applied the year before. Again, trying to avoid a situation where maybe somebody had a prevent plant situation where they put out a lot of nitrogen expecting to raise a corn crop, that soils may be still holding on to that. Now, the next year they're going to raise another corn crop. You know, if the soil already has adequate amounts of nitrogen to raise a corn crop, we don't want somebody putting on another 1 80 units in order to compete in this contest. So there are some rules out there, but I think they're all pretty common sense when you look at it. But we just want to make sure that we're trying to level the playing field to whatever extent that we can. The 180 pound rate, I think, kind of takes into account that some soils do provide more nitrogen than others. This type of a program across multiple states, unfortunately, we're just never going to be able to account for all those variations. There's always going to be those situations where maybe somebody feels they can't compete because of their soils or how they do things, but hopefully that 180 pound rate allows enough nitrogen to be applied even on those lower supplying soils that people feel that they can be competitive if they manage it properly. So as we looked at that maximum return to nitrogen calculator in specific, it applies largely to the Midwest and of course the fact, you know, I'm out of Streator, Illinois, so, you know, for me my expertise is kind of in the Midwest, but we realize that there's going to be a lot of changes when we look at other states. There's going to be arguments maybe for some different rates in terms of where they're at. So we did decide in the system as a pilot class here last year, and we are going to continue the limitation on the geography in this upcoming year. But we're looking at limiting it to some Midwest states, we're looking at nine states in the Midwest that we're allowing to join into this. Part of that is to make sure that we're not overwhelmed as we try to figure out all the ins and outs of this program and how we're going to make sure everybody is complying with the rules and how we're going to process the information that comes through, but also recognizing that we may need to reevaluate what those nitrogen rates look like as we move into different geographies and different states. Dusty Weis So first year of a new contest, we set the cap at 180 pounds of added nitrogen. Nick, I got to ask you, a lot of growers are going to look at 180 pounds of nitrogen and say, Whoa, that's insane. We've never done it like that. And some growers are going to look at that and say, I'll tighten the belt a little bit. Not a big deal. What was your reaction? Was it a fair number to work with in your mind? Nick Preissler I thought definitely was fair. From what we were already doing, we were kind of planning to start with the base rate below that. Anyhow, on my field it was corn on corn and it was still doable at the 180 pounds. So if you're going on soybean ground, you can probably cut back a little bit. But listening to Jim's points there on how difficult it is to set that for the whole nation there, I think they kind of came up with a pretty fair target there to start with. Dusty Weis Was that your why for why you wanted to enter the contest because you were already in that sort of a range anyways, that it wasn't going to be sort of a big stretch for you? Or what made you see this as a new pilot class in the contest and say, Yeah, it's something that I want to commit my farm to this year? Nick Preissler Yeah. So I'd have to say this was our second year working with a company called Sentinel Fertigation. We've been really focusing on trying to dial in our nitrogen efficiency the last two years. Their technology uses satellite imagery. We establish canary blocks in our fields with our first nitrogen application. The imagery analyzes those blocks throughout the growing season to kind of give us real time recommendation on if a certain field needs another shot of nitrogen or if we can hold off and get by with what we have out there. So I think utilizing this technology just fit right in line with this class. So we kind of wanted to put that to test against others. Dusty Weis Now, Nick, you're a younger fellow in the farming business. Aurora, Nebraska, is in eastern, approaching central Nebraska, sort of halfway between Lincoln and Kearney out there. Is this a family operation? Nick Preissler So, yeah, this is actually my sixth going into my sixth year farming on my own. I farm alongside my father and my uncle and also my grandpa. Dusty Weis What does your grandpa think about all these new technologies that you're able to deploy on the farm with the satellite imagery, with the sort of soil testing that you're able to do that help you make these big sweeping practice changes? Nick Preissler Yeah. So I think he really enjoys seeing us utilize these technologies. He talks about when they first started applying nitrogen, it was cheap. More was always better. He enjoys seeing us trying to dial that in now. Dusty Weis What about the location itself? Nick, out in Aurora, Nebraska. What sorts of challenges and opportunities does this location present you as a grower? Nick Preissler So in Hamilton County, a good majority of the acres here are irrigated. We're blessed with the Ogallala Aquifer below us, so we have really good wells. That's definitely a big advantage there. Along with that, I think some of the challenges would also be weather. Last year we found out that irrigation can't completely replace rainfall. It's meant to compliment the rainfall. We had some challenges there keeping up with that. Also with the weather. Hail and wind is pretty prevalent in our area. We try to minimize our risk there with nitrogen management. If we can hold back some of our applications just in case we do have a wind or hail event, it's pretty important. Dusty Weis Kind of helps you bounce back there after one of those traumatic events out in the field. Yeah, you certainly ended the season with a great yield, even with the limitation in place just shy of 313 bushels per acre, that's well above the national average of 177. Not far off from the 374 bushels per acre average of the yield contest national winners who weren't contending with the cap on their nitrogen. So what would you say you learned through this process? Nick Preissler We've really learned how difficult nitrogen management is. There's a lot of factors that go into play and how much nitrogen is available each year utilizing the technology to be able to read the crop throughout the growing season and let it tell you what it needs instead of trying to guess that ahead of time. Dusty Weis Looking back on everything that you learned, are there any big changes that you're planning to make going forward? Nick Preissler I think one big one, we're going to cut back our base rate for this year, so we're going to start out with a little bit less nitrogen up front and then wait and see if we need to have any additional passes after that. Dusty Weis Now, Jim, I'm sure a lot of people who are interested in this might be asking themselves at this point, how do you verify that no more than 180 pounds of nitrogen were used? Jim Isermann Yeah, that came out to be kind of the real trick. How do you verify this? Right? Because the program is simple. That's, again, one of the contests hasn't been so successful. So we didn't want it to be an overly intrusive process to try to verify this. But we did realize, you know, we need to set up some rules. We need to set up a way to kind of check those rules. So the guidelines are all available on the Corn Yield Contest web page. And everybody who is interested in looking at this program should take a review of them. So we set up all those different things in terms of, you know, if you're going to have manure involved, for example, you need to have a test for your manure, to let us know how much nitrogen is readily available. You know, you need to take an account of all fertilizer that's being applied. So if you're using a diammonium phosphate type scenario where you're applying nitrogen on there, sometimes farmers aren't necessarily through the amount of nitrogen that's going on because they're using that for their phosphorus. So it's making sure that you're accounting for all the nitrogen that is available that we're applying to that field. And then the audit process is taking a look at all your records just to make sure. Number one, certainly we're hoping nobody's doing anything kind of intentionally, but a lot of it is really just making sure that a farmer didn't miss something in their own calculations as they go through that. So we don't audit everybody. We're only looking at the winners. So we're kind of expecting that if you're enrolling in the program, you're going to give us that information that by and large it's going to be accurate. But in order to be a winner, we do go through a process where we ask you to submit your records at the field level. We look for geospatial maps. If you have anything available, we'll look at your yield data. We want to look at, you know, application maps. And again, there's some more fine tuned rules in there. If you look through the actual guidelines. For farmers who are good record keepers, I don't think it's very intrusive. I know with Nick, we shot him off an email saying, hey, you know, looking to do the audit, asked for some records. He responded pretty promptly, gave me the information back. And then I think we had about a 30 minute follow up call, just kind of walk through what some of that information was. So, you know, hopefully he can tell you how bad that process was. But I know he was pretty good to work with on that end and was able to provide the information that made us feel that we could verify it pretty easily. We'll be looking for feedback from producers who were involved, how that works, and as we ramp it up, that's one of the reasons we're still are quite ready to put this out nationwide. Dusty Weis Yeah, maybe I'm a huge nerd, but that's actually one part of the process that's really interesting to me because to do an audit, you need data. To get data, you need recordkeeping. And certainly farm record keeping is something that looks completely different from how it looked 30 years ago. Nick I got to ask you, was this all digital data that you were just able to drag into an attachment and fire over to Jim and the team, or are you guys still using notebook and pencil? Nick Preissler Yeah, most all of it was digital. We try to do a pretty good job of getting accurate records, and I guess we had as-applied maps that I was able to send over to Jim and it was a pretty easy process sharing it. Dusty Weis That makes it a lot easier. Yeah. I mean, Jim, can you even fathom running a category like this 30 years ago before so many of these records were digital? Would that even be something that was feasible? Jim Isermann Well, we do try to make some allowances for everyone who isn't going to have everything digital. So again, if you read through some of the guidelines, it's going to lay out, you know, if you don't have those as applied maps, what are we expecting from you in terms of submitting data? So we're going to be looking, though, a little harder at actual cash receipts or something like that. You know, might be a little more of a step to kind of prove, you know, what was actually applied to that field. I think we did a pretty good job. But at the end of the day, in order to keep the integrity of the program, we did have to kind of set some limitations that we're going to have to have something to really kind of be able to look and verify that this was done in an appropriate manner. Dusty Weis Right. The evolving technology definitely plays a role in it. But I wanted to ask both of your first and I think we'll start with Nick here. But when you talk to other growers, do you see these sorts of practices gaining attention and popularity? And if so, why do you think that is? Nick Preissler Yeah, so there's been a lot of interest from people just curious about the class, what we did to reach those levels in our area. I touched on the Ogallala Aquifer before. There's been a lot of focus on the nitrate levels. There is talk of regulations down the road, so I think everyone's trying to get ahead of that, really try to be as efficient as possible. Dusty Weis Regulate yourself before somebody else does it for you, sort of an attitude. Nick Preissler Exactly. Dusty Weis What about you, Jim? What do you think's driving a lot of the interest in this? Jim Isermann I think a lot of it is the certainly the environmental side. But the push from the farmers really does a lot of times come down to the economics of it all, just trying to understand what can we apply in terms of inputs that we're still getting the yield, but that that yield is profitable. So I think that's a big driver for some of these other practices. And we're just kind of coupling that with the environmental impacts because it is kind of surprising how often the right economic move could also be the right move for the environment. You know, particularly as we look at nitrogen, if we get the right rates out there, that gets us more in line with what we should be doing in terms of applications, but don't want to show our farmers either that they are responding very much to the questions that are being raised about their impact on the environment or they're out there trying to do the right things. I work with a lot of growers trying to adopt cover crops and reduce tillage systems, so it is both sides, but it's a much easier conversation when we can approach farmers from the money side of things and the economics then than trying to talk about potential regulations or concerns of that nature. Dusty Weis No, certainly. And of course, we're at a point right now in the year where down south maybe some folks are starting to get some crops in the ground. Here in the upper Midwest, they're at least getting their plans made for the year. As they're making their plans, what comes next for this class of the corn yield contest in 2024? Jim Isermann Well, I think first and foremost, anybody that wants to be involved understand that we're looking at that 180 pound rate. So that's going to apply to what you applied last fall as well for this upcoming corn crop. So if you're looking to take an interest in this class, you need to make sure that as you make those plans that you're looking at all those different forms of nitrogen and making sure that you're not going over that 180 pound limit. Can certainly visit the website, reach out to national corn. I'm sure they can get you in touch with me as well if you have any specific questions on that. But hopefully you're looking at your nitrogen applications and how you do that anyway. And maybe this can kind of be one more reason to look at lowering that rate if that's the case or if you're in a situation like Nick where it's not necessarily lowering the rate, I think it can be a great opportunity for you to show how well you can actually still raise corn with these types of nitrogen rates. Dusty Weis Nick, what about you? I mean, you're the reigning champ now. You got the title belt held up above your head here, up in the ring. Are you looking to go back to back now? Are you going to become the David Hula of the limited nitrogen category? Nick Preissler Sure gonna try, yeah. We're excited for this year and we're excited to make a few adjustments and just see what we can do again. Dusty Weis What would you say to other growers who might be thinking about the class, but they're really not sure about it yet? Nick Preissler I would encourage them to just try maybe start with one field to start cutting back a little bit. And I think a lot of people will be surprised with the kind of yields they can get. Dusty Weis And Jim, you mentioned a website. If I'm a grower and I want to learn more about the corn yield contest, where do I go to find out. Jim Isermann They can find more information on the yield contest by visiting NCGA.com/yieldcontest. Dusty Weis Well, gentlemen, thank you so much for filling us in and telling us a little bit more about this category of the yield contest. This is one of the things about the Corn Growers Association, I think that so many of us look forward to every year. And so it's been great to hear about your story, Nick, as well as sort of the impetus for why this new category was launched.

    "content": "A multi-state coalition of biofuel and farm advocates, including the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and many state corn advocates, called on President Biden’s Treasury Department to swiftly resolve any questions standing in the way of efforts to scale up U.S. production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Specifically, they urged the administration to quickly adopt the U.S. Department of Energy’s GREET model for the calculation of SAF tax credits (40B) under the Inflation Reduction Act – completing a process that was originally scheduled to conclude by March 1. “We are disappointed that the administration did not fulfill its commitment to release a modified GREET model by March 1, but we appreciate the importance of getting the modeling right,” wrote 26 organizations across 13 states, including Clean Fuels Alliance America, Growth Energy, National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, National Oilseed Processors Association, and the Renewable Fuels Association. “At the same time, we caution against contradictory changes to GREET that would stack unwarranted penalties on agricultural feedstocks, cut rural America out of a promising green energy market, and undermine any realistic path to achieving U.S. SAF goals.” SAF advocates emphasized the availability of well-established methodologies for certifying climate smart agriculture practices, in contrast to speculative and unverifiable penalties for indirect land use change favored by opponents of U.S. agriculture. “Failing to value regenerative and CSA advancements, as well as the full suite of biorefining innovations cited in guidance to date, would leave substantial carbon emissions reductions on the table and represent a missed opportunity to energize these promising sectors,” they wrote. “A consistent approach to ILUC and CSA is a vital part of giving farmers and SAF producers a credible, durable, and predictable framework for making the commitments necessary to effectuate IRA and the SAF Grand Challenge.” The full text of the letter and a list of signers can be found here.",

    "title": "Corn Growers: EPAs New Tailpipe Standard Will Hurt Family Farms",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) expressed grave concern and disappointment today with the Environmental Protection Agency’s final 2027-2032 emissions standards for sedans and light- and medium-duty trucks. The plan still relies almost exclusively on the use of electric vehicles, requiring that a majority of the specified fleets are electric in less than a decade. A decision of this magnitude will have long-lasting negative implications for the rural economy because it ignores the benefits of ethanol. “We are deeply concerned and disappointed that EPA has chosen to force a one-size-fits-all solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ignore the readily available solution that biofuels like ethanol bring to the table,” said NCGA President Harold Wolle. “This decision will not only severely hamper the administration’s ability to reach its own climate goals, but it will also hurt family farms and rural communities that rely heavily on the sale of biofuels. On top of that, it will remove consumer choice from the market.” Given that for the past 15 years more than one-third of the corn produced each year has been used in ethanol, Wolle’s concerns are shared by many experts. Economists Jeffrey Stokes and Jim Jansen, writing for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, recently noted this magnitude of structural loss in corn demand could lead to a permanent 50% decrease in the price of corn causing the top five corn-producing states (Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Indiana) to collectively lose well over $100 billion in farmland value from corn acreage alone. The authors noted that such a decline would have profound implications for the financial viability of Midwestern farming operations and the nation’s food supply. Corn growers have been on the forefront of the campaign to lower emissions. For example, NCGA has urged Congress to pass the Next Generation Fuels Act, which would set a new, cleaner standard for fuel that capitalizes on American-grown biofuels. The organization has also pushed for consumer access to higher blends of ethanol at the pump. Currently, around one percent of the cars on the road are electric vehicles. Increasing that number significantly will require major infrastructure developments and improvements in a short amount of time, something concerning to a majority of consumers, as shown in a recent survey, sponsored by NCGA and conducted by Morning Consult. Results from a recent survey showed that Americans have concerns on a range of issues involving electric vehicles, including the accessibility of charging stations, and 72 percent say vehicles that are compatible with biofuels should remain available to consumers. Farmers have pointed to California to illustrate the difficulties that come with an overreliance on electric vehicles. The state, one of the most prominent in the push for electrification, has spent years at the forefront of the transition to EVs, spending enormous political capital and billions of dollars to encourage its citizens to embrace electric vehicles. Yet, by the end of 2022, only 2.6% of the state’s light-duty vehicles were electrified. The desire to significantly reduce GHG emissions and address climate change has been a marquee issue",

    "title": "National Corn Growers Association Supports Congressional Letter Seeking to Open International Markets for Biofuels, Address Trade Barriers in Brazil",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association said today that it strongly supports the sentiments included in a letter from Reps. Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), Darin LaHood (R-Ill.) and 18 other members of Congress that was recently sent to President Biden and the U.S. Trade Representative. The letter urges action to remove trade barriers affecting ethanol and other biofuels, and open new export markets that would benefit farmers. “Opening new markets and reducing barriers to existing markets for biofuels is crucial to growing demand for corn growers,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “We are highly appreciative of Reps. Feenstra and LaHood for standing up for farmers, and we hope it will provide a roadmap for USTR as it works to address some high stakes trade issues like the current ethanol tariff in Brazil.” In the letter, the members of Congress highlighted the economic benefits of free markets. “The United States exports approximately 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol annually, utilizing 500 million bushels of corn that is predominantly supplied by American farmers,” the letter said. “The production and exportation of these biofuels provide an enormous boost to the rural communities that we represent. We urge you to actively support expanding market access for U.S. biofuels.” The letter referenced several countries that have created roadblocks for U.S. exports, including Brazil, which has levied an 18% tariff on ethanol imported from the U.S. and India’s ban on the imports of fuel-grade ethanol. “In the absence of enforceable [free trade agreements], we urge you to pursue an aggressive strategy to increase opportunities for market access through the reduction of trade barriers,” the letter said. “Specifically, some trading partners have implemented policies to restrict American biofuel imports, and we urge your continued attention to these matters.” NCGA and corn grower leaders have been on the forefront of these issues, championing new market development through the farm bill and encouraging USTR to address trade barriers. In 2023, for example, NCGA successfully pushed for USTR to file a dispute settlement under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement over Mexico’s decree banning biotech corn. READ THE LETTER",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association’s Corn Congress recently ratified a new strategic plan for the organization, modernizing its objectives and positioning the organization to focus on increasing corn demand. The vote to approve the new plan came on Saturday as Corn Congress concluded its meeting in Houston, Texas. After the vote, NCGA officials highlighted the plan’s importance to the organization’s mission. “Controlling the future is impossible, but we can take steps to Shape the Future,” said NCGA President and Minnesota farmer Harold Wolle. “This plan, which represents hundreds of hours of work and input from growers, our state partners, the Corn Board and NCGA staff, will allow us to meet the needs of our farmers, not just today but well into the future.” Driving demand for future U.S. corn production is a key focus of the plan, as projected yield trends show continued growth in production through the end of the decade and beyond. NCGA will also focus on protecting the profitability and operational freedom of corn growers through strong farm safety net programs and engagement with members of the value chain. “This strategic plan positions us well to address the important issues facing corn growers while taking advantage of the opportunities that will benefit our farmers and rural America,” said NCGA CEO Neil Caskey. “One of our top priorities over the next several years will be increasing demand for corn by maximizing our current markets and pursuing new opportunities both domestically and internationally.” Now that the strategic plan has been ratified, the NCGA board will develop annual operating plans, which will allow for flexibility to adjust goals and measurements as needed based on political and market developments.",

    "content": "As Treasury considers how to measure greenhouse gas emissions as it allocates tax credits for sustainable aviation fuels, the National Corn Growers Association’s (NCGA) Corn Congress, meeting in Houston, Texas, reaffirmed their support today for the use of the GREET model in making that determination. “Corn grower leaders across the country have made it clear that the GREET model is the most reliable measure in determining reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, as it weighs the environmental impacts from the farm to the car or plane,” said NCGA President Harold Wolle. “We strongly encourage the administration to embrace this model, and its accurate and fair calculation of corn’s environmental picture.” The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022, calls for the allocation of $1.25 for each gallon of sustainable aviation fuel in a qualified mixture. To qualify for the credit, biofuels must reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50%. NCGA has aggressively called on the Biden administration in general and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in particular to use GREET, formally called Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation, which was developed by the U.S. government and accurately shows the greenhouse gas emissions of corn ethanol. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, speaking at Commodity Classic in Houston on Friday, said Treasury will render the decision in the coming weeks.",

    "content": "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan said today that his agency will create the Office of Agriculture and Rural Affairs at the agency to focus on issues important to farmers. Rod Snyder, a former lobbyist for the National Corn Growers Association who currently serves as advisor to the administrator, will head the office. The announcement, which was made at Commodity Classic in Houston, Texas, was met with praise by NCGA. “We are exceptionally pleased that there will be a program at EPA that is tasked with ensuring the voices and concerns of farmers are heard loud and clear,” said NCGA President Harold Wolle. “And the administrator could not have found a better person to lead this office than Rod Snyder. Anyone who has worked with Rod will tell you he is a smart, stellar professional who thoroughly understands the agricultural community.” The announcement comes as EPA deals with a host of issues that will impact American farmers, including the regulations of crucial crop protection technologies and the long-term viability of the ethanol market. “We look forward to working with Rod and his colleagues in the coming days to ensure that the regulations that EPA puts in place will not hinder the work of farmers,” Wolle said. “Crop protection is essential to farming and has had a positive environmental impact by preventing over-tilling and reducing the need for chemicals during the planting process, among many other things.” Commodity Classic, one of the nation’s leading conventions for farmers, began on Wednesday and is expected to conclude later today.",

    "content": "Saying U.S. farmers depend on the strong demand that comes with expanded market access, the National Corn Growers Association’s (NCGA) Corn Congress today passed a consensus statement encouraging federal officials to pursue trade opportunities and invest in foreign market development to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in corn production and trade. “Building demand for U.S. corn is a top priority for NCGA and its state affiliates,” said Harold Wolle, NCGA president. “International markets are crucial to the overall demand for U.S. corn, and actions that restrict access to foreign markets will hurt both U.S. farmers and the broader U.S. economy.” The full text of the consensus is as follows: \"Whereas, market access is critical for U.S. farmers to be successful and support the nation’s economy. Whereas, market access could be negatively impacted by retaliation that targets U.S. farmers. Whereas, U.S. farmers depend on robust and expanded market access for exporting food and agricultural products in order to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in corn production. \"Therefore, we the assembled voting delegates of the National Corn Growers Association, support improved market access including the reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers so that U.S. corn growers have many opportunities to increase demand from foreign trading partners.”",

    "title": "Corn Growers Welcome Decision by EPA on Access to Year-Round E15 While Calling for Legislation to Eliminate Nationwide Patchwork on Ethanol",
    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency announced today that it will grant the request by eight Midwestern governors to allow the year-round sale of fuel with a 15% ethanol blend, or E15, in their states beginning in the summer of 2025. The announcement was welcomed by the National Corn Growers Association, which has been fighting to break down barriers to the environmentally friendly biofuels. “We are glad to hear this decision from EPA, as it puts us on the road to providing more certainty to America’s corn growers and consumers who will save money at the pump,” said NCGA President and Minnesota Farmer Harold Wolle. “However, given that this decision will not take effect until the summer of 2025, we question and are concerned about the implications of the timeline for growers and consumers this summer.” The sale of E15 has been banned during the summer months to meet federal clean air standards that have been shown to be unnecessary and outdated. The U.S. EPA has granted waivers over the last few years to allow drivers continued access to environmentally friendly and affordable E15. Even after today’s announcement, NCGA says a permanent legislative fix is still needed. “While we are pleased with today’s decision, we still need a law that codifies access to higher levels of ethanol and that eliminates the patchwork of state regulations on the issue,” said Wolle. “That is why we are pushing for the passage of the Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act in the Senate to solve this issue once and for all.”",

    "title": "2024 Commodity Classic: Double the Opportunity to Hear Directly from the Countrys Key Leaders on Agriculture Priorities",
    "content": "USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack & EPA Administrator Michael Regan Confirmed for General Session In an unprecedented opportunity for Commodity Classic attendees, both United States Department of Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan will keynote the General Session of this year’s event, fast approaching Feb. 28-March 2 in Houston. The General Session is Friday, March 1, 8:30-10:30 a.m. (CST) at the George R. Brown Convention Center. The 2024 show, entitled “New Frontiers in Agriculture,” will also feature Mike Massimino in the esteemed General Session speaker lineup. Massimino is a former NASA astronaut, New York Times bestselling author, and Columbia University professor, in addition to media and television personality. Retaining a longstanding crowd-pleaser, the session will again include a panel discussion with leaders of the five associations that present Commodity Classic each year: American Soybean Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Sorghum Producers, and the Association of Equipment Manufacturers. The list of issues affecting agriculture and that are important to U.S. farmers remains long and varied. Attendees can expect to hear from these two knowledgeable Cabinet members on a range of topics that may include farm bill, crop protection, biofuels, biotechnology, conservation, bioeconomy and more. Secretary Vilsack was confirmed in February 2021 to serve as the 32nd U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. He returned to the role he previously filled for eight years, having been the longest-serving member of President Obama’s original Cabinet. Prior to that appointment, he served two terms as Governor of Iowa, served in the Iowa State Senate and as mayor of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. Administrator Regan was sworn in as the 16th Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in March 2021, becoming the first Black man and second person of color to lead the U.S. EPA. Regan is a native of Goldsboro, North Carolina, where he developed a passion for the environment while hunting and fishing with his father and grandfather, and exploring the vast lands, waters, and inner Coastal Plain of North Carolina. As the son of two public servants—his mother, a nurse for nearly 30 years, and his father, a retired Colonel with the North Carolina National Guard, Vietnam veteran, and former agricultural extension agent—Regan went on to follow in his parents' footsteps and pursue a life of public service. Prior to his nomination as EPA Administrator, he served as the Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. Education is a hallmark of Commodity Classic.

    "title": "Consider Corn Challenge IV Spotlight: Bluestem Biosciences",
    "content": "Bluestem Biosciences—one of four grand winners of the National Corn Growers Association's (NCGA) Consider Corn Challenge IV—stands at the forefront of renewable chemicals innovation in the Midwest. Harnessing the power of programmable biology, Bluestem is revolutionizing the biomanufacturing sector by developing sustainable solutions for commodity chemicals. Their groundbreaking decarbonized chemical platform promises far-reaching benefits, from mitigating climate impact to revitalizing agricultural economies and domestic supply chains, thus paving the way for a bio-based future across the chemical sector. At the heart of Bluestem's success lies their pioneering work in developing novel yeast biology for the anaerobic bio-production of 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP). This chemical intermediate, with a substantial $25 billion total addressable market, serves as a strategic platform molecule with applications across diverse consumer end markets, including personal care products, acrylates, paints, and coatings. By leveraging their innovative yeast biology, Bluestem aims to retrofit underutilized, older ethanol production infrastructure across the United States, thus maximizing economic potential while supporting rural Midwest bioeconomies and agricultural communities. This paired with their “whole kernel solution,” enables the cheapest source of fermentable sugar and enables both price and performance parity to the petro-based incumbents. \"Our Market Development Action Team (MDAT) is thrilled to see how Bluestem Biosciences' technology is unlocking new horizons for corn utilization, driving innovation, and opening avenues for sustainable economic growth,” said Ohio grower and MDAT Chair Denny Vennekotter. “Bluestem’s approach not only creates new markets for corn-derived products but also inspires further exploration within the agricultural and biomanufacturing sectors. Bluestem's achievements highlight the power of collaboration between science, industry and agriculture in creating a more resilient, sustainable future while addressing need across the market.\" One of the key advantages of Bluestem's technology is its ability to reduce dependence on foreign petroleum feedstock for chemical production, instead relying on domestically produced corn as the primary renewable feedstock. This not only enhances sustainability but also contributes to reshoring supply chains back to the United States, promoting domestic production and reducing reliance on foreign resources. By repurposing existing infrastructure and embracing sustainable practices, Bluestem is driving significant strides toward a greener, more resilient future for the chemical industry. In summary, Bluestem Biosciences exemplifies the transformative potential of biotechnology in addressing pressing environmental challenges while unlocking economic opportunities. Their commitment to innovation, sustainability, and community empowerment positions them as a leading force in shaping a more sustainable and prosperous future for industry and society.",

    "title": "Iowa Farmer and NCGA Board Member Bob Hemesath Tapped to Serve as President of Trade Advocacy Group",
    "content": "National Corn Growers Association board member and Iowa corn grower Bob Hemesath was recently elected to serve as president of the international agricultural advocacy group Farmers for Free Trade. “I am honored to assume this leadership role at an organization that has been so effective in advocating on behalf of farmers and their trade priorities,” Hemesath said. “I look forward to leading the organization in a direction that will allow us to build on our successes and further advance the trade goals of America’s farmers.” The U.S. exported 1.8 billion bushels of corn in 2023 valued at $13.1 billion, according to the latest data by the U.S. Census Bureau. Additionally, exports of ethanol and its co-products were exported that year at a value of $7.1 billion. Corn is also exported in the form of animal protein when corn-fed, U.S.-raised beef, pork and poultry is shipped overseas. Shipments of these products resulted in $23.6 billion in export value in 2023. With export opportunities being a crucial market for U.S. corn farmers, NCGA and its partners regularly advocate for free trade and market-building opportunities around the globe. NCGA President Harold Wolle believes Hemesath will provide strong leadership for Farmers for Free Trade. “Bob is an incredible farmer and advocate, and he will no doubt provide exemplary leadership in this new role,” said Wolle. “Bob knows well the trade issues crucial to corn growers and will be in position to elevate our voices, which makes his appointment particularly important and meaningful to NCGA.” Farmers for Free Trade mobilizes farmers and the public to advocate for free trade initiatives. It is considered the preeminent advocacy group on the topic. Hemesath has served on the NCGA board for the last three years and has played a crucial role in the organization’s advocacy efforts in Washington. He raises corn and soybeans and runs a head hog wean-to-finish and feeder-to-finish hog operation in Decorah, Iowa.",

    "title": "Thousands of Farmers Across the Country Caution Biden Administration Against Solely Focusing on Electric Vehicles at Expense of Biofuels in Climate Fight",
    "content": "A letter signed by 3,466 farmers from across the country was sent to President Biden today expressing concern that his administration is taking a short-sighted approach to addressing climate change by prioritizing the use of electric vehicles over biofuels, such as corn ethanol, as it works to drastically lower the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. “If we are going to address climate change and meet our sustainability goals, we are going to have to take a multi-pronged approach, that includes tapping into higher levels of biofuels, such as corn ethanol, which offers an immediate climate solution,” the letter said. The letter, which drew thousands of signatures in less than a week, comes as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prepares to release its light- and medium-duty vehicle tailpipe emissions standards for 2027-2032. To help meet the standards, the president has set a goal that 50% of all vehicle sales will be electric by 2030. A similar rulemaking is also being considered through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. A recent survey, sponsored by the National Corn Growers Association and conducted by Morning Consult, showed that Americans have concerns on a range of issues involving electric vehicles, including the accessibility of charging stations, and an overwhelming majority say vehicles that are compatible with biofuels should remain available to consumers. In January, thousands of auto dealers from across the country signed on to a similar letter to the president noting that electric vehicles were not selling quickly and were piling up on dealer lots. In the most recent letter, the farmers said it could take years before EVs become popular with consumers, which means the administration must expand its focus and efforts to address GHGs with solutions that are available now. “As a low-carbon, clean energy source and an affordable, homegrown fuel, ethanol serves as a critical pathway for agriculture and rural America to contribute to a sustainable future,” the letter noted. “We hope you will join us in fully embracing this technology as we all do our best to fight the causes and effects of climate change.” The letter noted that California, one of the most prominent states in the push for electrification has spent years at the forefront of the transition to EVs, spending enormous political capital and billions of dollars to encourage its citizens to embrace these vehicles. Yet, by the end of 2022, only 2.6% of the state’s light-duty vehicles were electrified. Gas stations nationwide currently carry fuel with at least 10% ethanol blends, though selling higher blends of ethanol through the summer months currently requires a waiver by EPA. Corn growers have urged Congress to pass legislation that would allow for higher levels of ethanol blends year-round. NCGA is also pushing to advance the Next Generation Fuels Act, which would lower fuel prices, reduce carbon emissions and help shore-up America’s energy security. Read Letter",

    "title": "Consider Corn Challenge IV Spotlight: Mazly",
    "content": "Maïzly—one of four winners in the National Corn Growers Association’s (NCGA) Consider Corn Challenge IV—has emerged as a pioneer in the realm of plant-based alternatives, particularly in the creation of a nutritious beverage derived from corn. Founded by Tim Leclercq and Marcel Van Der Merwe, the company has perfected a formula that replicates the mouthfeel of dairy milk while offering a smooth, natural taste that enhances rather than masks the flavors it accompanies. With a range of delicious flavors—original, chocolate, vanilla and strawberry—as well as a tasty custard, Maïzly has positioned itself as a game-changer in the plant-based food industry, capturing customers who cannot consume dairy milk or other plant based alternative beverages due to allergies or intolerances. The key innovation lies in Maïzly's identification of a specific corn variant that not only mimics the characteristics of dairy milk but also contributes to a unique taste profile. Unlike traditional methods used in oat milk production, Maïzly's process minimizes waste of water and ingredients, underscoring its commitment to sustainability and cost competitiveness. The select corn variant also imparts longevity to the flavor in the flavored range, setting Maïzly apart from other plant-based milk alternatives. One notable achievement is Maïzly's Infant Formula, inspired by Tim and Marcel's experiences in Sub-Saharan Africa. Recognizing the need for an affordable lactose-free infant formula, the duo introduced CODEX compliant formulas, including the F100 and F75 formulas crucial for treating acute malnutrition in infants. This initiative showcases Maïzly's commitment to addressing global health challenges through innovative and accessible solutions. \"Our NCGA Market Development Action Team (MDAT) is excited to witness the impact of innovative products like Maïzly's on the corn industry. Embracing new uses for corn is essential for sustainable growth, and their plant-based milk alternative is proof to the powers of necessity and ingenuity,” said Kansas grower and MDAT Vice Chair Chad Epler. “Their corn-based milk alternative not only propels the corn industry forward, but it also addresses evolving consumer and healthcare needs, marking a pivotal moment in our journey towards a more sustainable and diverse future.\" For a closer look at how Maïzly is transforming the landscape of plant-based alternatives with its unique approach and dedication to sustainability, check out this video.",

    "title": "High Quality, Good Taste & Sustainability Should Have No Borders",
    "content": "The importance of collaborative ag industry partnerships is front and center in a new video funded in part by the National Corn Growers Association’s (NCGA) Market Development Action Team. The U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) partnered with U.S. Pork, U.S. Soy, NCGA, the Beef Checkoff, and American Lamb to produce a visually engaging narrative that showcases how American producers' dedication to the land and animals translates into high-quality, sustainable protein worldwide. The video—Beyond Borders—aims to highlight the U.S. red meat industry's commitment to sustainability, recognizing its growing importance in global markets and meeting customer demand. \"The USMEF Beyond Borders video illustrates the power of collaboration between corn and our valued partners across the meat industry. By working hand in hand with our animal ag partners, we are not just cultivating crops; we are cultivating a future where best practices and a shared commitment to the land will lead the way to a more sustainable and resilient agricultural landscape,” said Ohio grower and Market Development Action Team Chair Denny Vennekotter. By working hand in hand with our animal ag partners, we are not just cultivating crops; we are cultivating a future where best practices and a shared commitment to the land, will lead the way to a more sustainable and resilient agricultural landscape,” said Ohio grower and Market Development Action Team Chair Denny Vennekotter. “U.S. corn producers want everyone to have access to the best quality, most sustainable corn-based products. It is part of our commitment to be good stewards, and we take that commitment very seriously.” The video serves as a powerful tool in conveying the message of sustainability to both international trade partners and consumers. This joint effort across the ag sector effectively communicates the story of how conscientious farming practices contribute to delicious meals on tables worldwide. High quality, good taste and sustainability should have no borders.",

    "title": "National Corn Growers Association Expresses Disappointment with International Trade Commission Decision on Fertilizer Tariffs",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) said today that it is deeply disappointed in a decision released by the International Trade Commission, which upholds an earlier opinion that found material injury to U.S. fertilizer companies during a time of rising on-farm fertilizer prices that went on to reach record highs. The decision comes after the U.S. Court of International Trade asked the U.S. Department of Commerce and ITC to reconsider earlier decisions they issued on the matter. “The idea that major fertilizer conglomerates were materially injured even as they were posting substantially higher profits during the time in question sounds dubious to me,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “ITC’s decision flies in the face of the U.S. Court of International Trade’s request to seriously reconsider this issue and ignores the negative impact these tariffs continue to have on America’s farmers who are facing higher prices for fertilizers that are critical to the success of their crops. We will continue to make a vigorous case for eliminating or lowering these tariffs.” The ITC opinion upholds an earlier decision by the agency that the trade practices of a Moroccan-based company caused harm to U.S. fertilizer companies. The decision comes almost a week after the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it was lowering duties on these products from 19.97% to 7.41%, and introduces uncertainty on the fate of tariffs as it could be used as an argument to keep tariffs on phosphate fertilizers high. The U.S. Court of International Trade will now review the remand decisions and issue a final ruling. The Department of Commerce is also set to make another decision regarding its administrative review later this year. Commerce and the ITC originally acted on a petition by The Mosaic Company, a U.S.-based fertilizer producer, which had requested the tariffs over what it called unfair trading practices. Over the past three years, NCGA has advocated for growers who were facing record-high phosphate prices by filing an amicus brief in the case, sending letters to the White House and federal agencies, and informing Members of Congress about the impact of the high prices on corn farmers.",

    "title": "EP. 44 - Ethanols Past, Present and Future as a Benefit for Corn, with Scott Irwin, Bradley Schad and Julie Busse",
    "content": "How the Renewable Fuel Standard has changed the corn industry, and what’s on the horizon for this key sector. Since its adoption in 2005, no other piece of policy has changed the corn industry more than the Renewable Fuel Standard. Ethanol has become one of the most important markets for corn in that time. But over the last couple of years, there are new developments that could be major boon for this crucial sector. So in this episode, we're going to talk with a few ethanol experts to get their perspectives on how that market has developed, where it's at today, and where they’re hoping it will go in the future. Joining us are agricultural economist Scott Irwin from the University of Illinois; Julie Busse, a member of the National Corn Growers Association ethanol team; and Bradley Schad, the CEO of the Missouri Corn Merchandising Council and Missouri Corn Growers Association. They’ll provide some important context about ethanol’s history as a fuel, and also tell us how you can get involved with critical efforts to secure its future. Visit NCGA.com/Octane to get involved yourself.

Bradley Schad There is no greater bipartisan issue than making sure we have the ability to produce our energy needs here at home and make sure we’re protecting our country. Dusty Weis Hello, and welcome to the CobCast, Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the D.C. Beltway, we're making sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you’re following this show in your favorite podcast app, and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at NCGA.com. I'm Dusty Weis and in this episode, one of the most important markets for corn is the ethanol industry. But over the last couple of years, there are new developments that could be major boon for this crucial sector. So we're going to talk with a few folks who think a lot about ethanol and get their perspectives on how that market has developed, where it's at today, and where they’re hoping it will go in the future. We're going to be talking to agricultural economist Scott Irwin with the University of Illinois, Julie Busse, a member of the National Corn Growers Association ethanol team, and Bradley Schad, the CEO of the Missouri Corn Merchandising Council and Missouri Corn Growers Association. So to think about where we hope the industry will go in the future, let's first take a step back and think about where it's been. Scott, you've studied commodity markets for a long time. You know a great deal about how the ethanol industry has evolved over the past few decades. There at the University of Illinois for my old man who was an Illini himself, I'm obligated to chime in with a Go Illini. But why don't you tell us a little bit about your career and how you wound up in your position at the U of I. Scott Irwin Well, I grew up an Iowa farm boy and still have connections to our family farm in Iowa. Got fascinated with the grain and commodity markets in the big mid-70s boom and then started studying the markets in graduate school. Got a job at Ohio State. And at the University of Illinois, I was very fortunate to follow in someone that a lot of people in the industry know, Tom Hieronymus's position here at the University of Illinois and a great mentor of mine. And in simplest terms, ff you know, my career and my motivations, the best way I can describe it is I tell people, I do a lot of different things here at the University of Illinois. I was the leader of the farmdoc team for a long time. Write a lot about ethanol, biofuels and crop yields, all sorts of things. Do a lot of research, teach classes. But the one thread that connects them all is you could say that I am fascinated by anything that affects the price of corn and soybeans. So that's kind of the thread that connects my work. And so that makes sense why I got so interested in ethanol really starting about 2007, 2008 as the ethanol boom was really taking off. That's when my interest in it really started taking off because I wanted to know why we were building all these ethanol plants and what was it going to do to the price of corn. Dusty Weis Well, and what a perfect coincidence for us too, because as NCGA staff, as growers, we're also very fascinated by the price of corn. But I'd love to sort of jump in the time machine with you here and go back 20 years. Biofuels and demand driven by the Renewable Fuel Standard has been one of the most important things to happen to the corn industry in that time. And so if we jump back to the early 2000s, can you provide us a little bit of a background on how the RFS is structured and what it's set up to do? Scott Irwin Sure. In its most basic form, it's a set of annual volume standards for the entire United States in terms of different categories of biofuels that must be blended into the transportation fuel supply of the United States. So it says you need to use, say, 15 billion gallons of ethanol in this year. It's that simple. What's really interesting is the RFS, those standards do not ever go away until the US Congress and the president would sign a law that took the RFS off the books. So we will have those annual mandated volumes forever until it's taken off the books. So that's what the volumes are and how does that work in practical terms? Well, under the law, there are entities called “obligated parties.” They're basically crude oil refiners, are the obligated parties under the RFS. And it's their responsibility under the law, they are legally obligated to demonstrate compliance with those volume mandates. And that's essentially the basics of how the RFS works. Dusty Well, and you hit on a really important key part there because having the standard is one thing, but enforcing the standard is something completely different. And that's where these things called renewable identification numbers or RINs come into play. It's essentially, as I understand it, a means of accounting for those refiners to demonstrate that they are meeting their obligations. So can you help us understand RINs and why those are important and how they work? Scott Irwin Well, if you're going to mandate volumes of biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel and renewable diesel, you have to have a way to track those volumes. And the original RFS statutes specified a system, which is RINs for short, whereby whenever a batch of ethanol is produced in the United States or even imported, it gets assigned a RIN number. It's actually a 38 digit identifier and it is assigned to every batch of biofuels that's produced. And that number, think of it like a certificate that travels along with the biofuel as it moves through the supply chain from the ethanol producer to the ultimate gasoline driver who fills up their tank at the gas pump. And what the system is designed so that when, say, ethanol is blended with petroleum gasoline and then sold at the pump, the refiner can say that RIN is now detachable from the fuel and they can now take that certificate and turn it in to the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, to say, yay, look, for that batch of biofuels, it was blended into the transportation fuel supply just like the law says it's supposed to. So the RIN is the mechanism that demonstrates compliance that the physical biofuel is actually used at the retail level. So that's what the RIN is. The really interesting and unique feature of the RINs is it was created where these are negotiable and traded instruments. So that means that let's say you have refiner A who, for whatever reason, blended more biofuels in a given year than their particular obligation as a part of the national volume standards. And then you've got refiner B, who for whatever reason didn't quite blend enough ethanol this year. Refiner B can just buy the excess RIN certificates from refiner A and turn those in to demonstrate because as far as the standards are concerned it doesn't matter who did the blending as long as the overall amount of ethanol blended when you add up all the certificates that are turned in equal the standard. Dusty Weis As a country, we met our obligations collectively. And so that's essentially good enough. And it sort of creates a secondary market like you've seen with carbon credits being another example here, where people who have more RINs than they need can sell them off and trade in them. And how does all of that create value for the growers at the end of the day, would you say? Scott Irwin Well, the RINs themselves don't really create the value. They represent the value of the standards themselves. So there's an economic interpretation of the price of the RINs that are traded in the secondary market, of which I'm sure we don't have the time or the interest to get into those nuances. I have a new book out called Back to the Futures and I have an entire chapter related to RINs and, there's even people on Twitter. One of my best Twitter followers is a guy named Rini the Gopher, some unknown fuel energy trader. I have a picture of the Gopher that he takes around with him in my book. So if you're interested in all that, you can check that out. Funny how these things work. Dusty Weis There's a whole world of characters in this landscape that I wasn't even aware of here, Scott. Scott Irwin Absolutely. But more seriously the mandates and particularly ethanol feeding back into the price of corn, it's had a very large and sustained impact on the price of corn. We essentially, after 2006, almost doubled the price of corn on average. And there's a big argument among agricultural economists about, okay, exactly how much of that should we attribute to the RFS and the ethanol mandates? But, I’m convinced that it's at least a third to a half of that increase in the average price that we've seen and so that makes a tremendous difference at the grower level certainly does you know on our farms and the price of corn and if the price of corn goes up the price of soybeans we'll have to follow as well so it's like I like to say it's a very enviable safety net on the demand for biofuels and that has to have a price impact. Dusty It's a good spot to be in and certainly even 20 years later here, growers are certainly glad to have that safety net there. Thank you for that background, Scott. That's been really helpful to sort of set the stage for the next part of the conversation here. And we were planning this podcast episode during the holidays here. And so I started in my head referring to it as the ghosts of ethanol past, ethanol present and ethanol future. And so I think it's time to bring in our ghosts of ethanol present and future here Julie Busse, NCGA played a big role getting the RFS passed way back when. Can you tell me what sort of work NCGA has done in the years since then to make sure that ethanol markets remain a vital market for corn growers? Julie Busse Yeah, Dusty, that's a great question. And honestly, there's a couple of different ways that I could answer that question. So obviously there's the policy side. Scott touched on that a little bit, but there's also the market development side and what we're doing in the countryside and then the communications piece of all this too to answer your question. So briefly, let me touch on the policy side, but let me say I am not the policy expert. I am definitely the market development side of the equation at NCGA. But certainly there's been a lot that has happened in the six years in my time. And so, to say that we've been very busy is an understatement. So I'm just going to touch on a few of the policy things, but knowing there's a lot more that we just don't have time to get to today. So obviously E-15 year round, that is something that we have been talking about a lot lately. So we had it at one time and then we didn't have E-15 again year round. The past couple of years, we've had to go through the emergency waiver process over the summer months to allow the sale of E-15. And even more recently, eight Midwest governors have been seeking a permanent waiver for their states to sell E-15 year round. In fact, just before Christmas, the EPA did advance that request to the Office of Management and Budget. So that's progressing and hopefully we'll have an answer here in the next just two to three months on that. In the past, obviously another thing that we've talked a lot about and heard a lot about has been small refinery exemptions, SREs. And having to defend the RFS is something that we've certainly continued to watch closely and focus on. And you know, Scott touched on that a little bit in his remarks too. Ensuring that the RFS volumes are strong and that blending requirements are met have been very, very important to NCGA. Something that we're going to touch on here in a little bit, but I have to bring this up, is you know, NCGA and with the support of our state partners have been working the past few years on the Next Generation Fuels Act. Again, I'm not going to touch on that right now because I know going to get there, but that is our top legislative priority for NCGA. And then recently three, four months ago, you've probably heard a lot about the proposed fuel economy standards from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that unfortunately was very focused on electrification and didn't really take into account the role that corn ethanol can play in things like energy security and the environmental benefits for the transportation sector. So those are just a few of the things on the policy side. We could do an entire podcast series, but like Scott said, I'm not sure anyone wants that right now. So let me move on a little bit to some of the things that we've been doing from a market development and market saturation perspective from NCGA. So one of our signature programs that we've been doing over the past three to four years is what we call our fuel dispenser infrastructure program or FDI. So this program is aimed at making sure we're expanding access in the countryside and all over to future mid-level blends of ethanol through pump infrastructure. So we've actually been working with two of the largest pump manufacturers who make up 98% of market share on producing and selling pumps that are certified to deliver up to 25% and 40% ethanol. To date, NCGA and our state partners have directly funded the production and sale, of over 82,000 fueling dispensers in North America that are certified up to E25 and E40. This is certainly a program that we see as a success that we're going to continue in the future. And hopefully in the next few months, we've got some exciting more good news to share on that program. Another area real quick, I want to touch on too, that NCGA and the ethanol action team has been a part of, is we've been very supportive of USDA's Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program, or HBIP, as you might have heard it called. Through the Inflation Reduction Act, actually USDA invested $500 million to the HBIP program, which is awesome. That program is meant to increase the sales and use of higher ethanol blends by expanding the infrastructure to do that. Now, one of the things that we've been doing in partnership with the Renewable Fuels Association is application assistance for retailers. One of the things that we have heard consistently is that it's really hard for your smaller retailers to go through this many, many page application process. And there had been issues with, you know, some getting halfway, three quarters, almost 90% of the way done and just not being able to finish the process. So partnering with RFA, we actually helped fund a program that they did called HBIP University, which kind of helps walk retailers through part of that application process so they can get through some of it on their own before RFA comes in and helps with technical assistance. Through our support of RFA's technical assistance, actually $56 million in grants has been awarded in just FY23. And RFA has had a hundred percent success rate for those retailers who have received the grant assistance from RFA. So that has been another great program to make sure we're getting infrastructure in the marketplace. And then finally, the last program I'll touch on very briefly that is certainly near and dear to my heart for anyone who knows me. My background is communications and radio. That is my passion. That's what I that's what I've done for most of my career until I started this role a year ago with NCGA. But we started a Washington DC ethanol education campaign that is really working to build our base of ethanol supporters through communications efforts in Washington DC. So this has been really a multi-pronged approach of research and focus groups and then paid and earned media. You know, we just talked about some of the policy issues. They're really complicated and sometimes being able to step back and just share the general benefits of corn ethanol whether it's the environmental, the economic, the consumer choice at the pump, saving money at the pump. Trying to share those basic messages with members of Congress and their staff and maybe the career EPA person, just trying to share why ethanol should be a part of the conversation and why we should be leaning on ethanol as we move into the energy future. So we've got a lot of success from that campaign over the past year and I'm really excited to continue that campaign in the future. Just a few quick stats, you know, we've been able to secure op-ed statements in Fox Business, RealClearEnergy, The Washington Examiner, Chicago Sun-Times, for instance. We did a Politico piece that had 7 million impressions and over 8,000 page views. One of the other things too that's been kind of fun is, you know, when some of those big events like the State of the Union and Congress coming back into town, we're actually geo-targeting those areas and collecting device IDs so that we can later target people with our message. So it's a program that I'm excited to continue about in 2024 and certainly cannot, that program wouldn't have been a success if it weren't for a partnership with our state partners. They have been a very integral piece of that campaign and they're the reasons why this campaign started to begin with; to continue to grow demand and make sure that we have a strong marketplace for ethanol moving forward. Dusty It's really cool to hear, Julie, about some of the new communications technologies that you're leveraging to make this initiative work and really using it in unique ways as well to sort of get the message out there. And say, if you're playing along at home here, make sure to pull out your Webster's dictionary and turn it to the page for I right now, where you're going to find irons in the fire and a picture of Julie and the entire NCGA ethanol team here… But I want to go to Bradley Schad next year from the Missouri Corn Merchandising Council and the Missouri Corn Growers Association, because Julie, you hinted at it a little bit, but the big piece of legislation that NCGA is working on nationally in Washington is the Next Generation Fuels Act. So Bradley, what can you tell us about that and where we're at? Bradley Schad Well, as you mentioned, the Next Generation Fuels Act, it is a big piece of legislation. It does a lot for the industry. It is the sole piece of legislation that NCGA and the state partners have been working on. The Next Generation Fuels Act modernizes our nation's fuel supply to use a high octane, low carbon fuel. It cuts cost, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality and increases fuel efficiency. What it ultimately does is it requires a vapor pressure parity for all ethanol blends as you go up. It ensures greenhouse gas reductions. It revises the calculation for dual fuel vehicles. Increases octane in the fuel. Ensures a role for ethanol in the future. Allows the autos to manufacture the engines rather than being required, as Julie talked about earlier, this administration, what they have put forward on requiring electric vehicles. This gives the autos the ability to produce internal combustion engines that consumers want. And that's going to go back to one thing that Julie left out, the benefits of ethanol. It’s energy security. I would be remiss to not talk about going back to my start in the ethanol industry, and that was actually before I had a job with the Corn Growers Association. It was whenever I was in college, ethanol was cheaper. It was in 2004, 2005, driving my vehicle to college, ethanol was a dollar a gallon cheaper. And so being from the Show Me State, I started blending my own and saw all the misnomers out there, the untruth facts that the oil industry was putting out there was untrue. Because I'm from the Show Me State, I had to try it myself and ran on higher blends in my 2000 F-150 for many miles and never had any issues whatsoever. And so that's kind of how I got my start in dispelling the myths that are out there about ethanol. Because there was actually a sign there that said who would you rather buy your gas from you know your local farmer or someone across the globe and so it got me to thinking and that's whenever I started my journey promoting ethanol. Dusty I gotta ask, Bradley, tell me about this blending operation. Did you set this up in the garage, in the shed out back? Where are you blending your own gas? Bradley Schad No, no I just went to the pump the local retailer had E85 and E10 and so I'd fill up with E10 about half the way and then pull up to the E85 pump and fill up the rest of the way and I had to show myself that ethanol wasn't harmful to my engine There's been all kinds of things out there that said that it would and I had to prove to myself that hey it's quite alright to use it because it's safe. It comes from a renewable resource and we can produce jobs and have cleaner air here at home. It's better for my engine and had less carbon emissions coming out the tailpipe. Dusty Weis Well, and being a young man at the time in college, I imagine you didn't mind saving that money that you saved either. Bradley Schad Absolutely, and you know we've kind of come full circle now to where energy security is big again. You know, right now with this administration pushing for EVs, we get a majority of our lithium and battery products from a country that doesn't necessarily like us. And so we need to be careful on how we do that and how we set our policies going forward to make sure that we're still providing the opportunity to get our energy needs here from the United States and from home. Because we don't want to be having issues and supply issues of getting our products here. Dusty Weis So the Next Generation Fuels Act, essentially it requires higher octane fuels at the gas pump, which is good for anyone who drives a car, and it's certainly a role that corn ethanol can fill. It requires lower carbon and emissions, which is good for everybody, basically. But I'm dying to know, Scott, if you don't mind my asking, what would the Next Generation Fuels Act do for farmers? Have we studied that? Scott Irwin I have not studied that personally, but I don't think that it's probably mysterious. It would definitely be good for farmers and the price of corn. It would be, in my opinion, just another way of increasing the demand for corn ethanol. You're just basically upping the standards, but you're doing it in a different way. As I understand it, you're essentially creating an octane standard for fuel. And since corn ethanol is one of the cheapest sources of octane, that's the way to understand it. Dusty And it sounds like a win-win, a great opportunity for corn growers and ethanol producers as well. So Bradley, what's been happening with that legislation lately? Where are we at? Bradley Schad Well, we've been working hard with our partners at NCGA and all of our other states. But I do want to clarify, this technically isn't a mandate. What it does is it breaks down the barriers and breaks down the building blocks that the oil industry has put up for the last hundred years and allows the autos to be able to produce engines to use ethanol in the future. And so they can produce octane in other ways. Yes, there's a carve out for the amount that we use, but and it's the cheapest source also so it does provide the opportunity to sell more ethanol. But we've been working together with NCGA and all of our other state partners to get a growing consensus of legislators continuously working to make sure that they're educated on the issue and how important it is to pass legislation that would do that. That would increase our octane standards for all the reasons that we mentioned earlier. So we're also working on getting partners, businesses that support the Next Generation Fuels Act and support ethanol out there. We've got individual retailers that have jumped on board saying that we've got to have this. An electric vehicle doesn't work out in rural Missouri. They’re not going to come to a small mom and pop retail location and fill up their electric vehicle one, because they're not going to have it, but two, they're not going to want to go into a convenience store that doesn't have something to do for 30 or 40 minutes. And so we're getting more and more support all the time from interesting partners. We’ve got it from our feed retailers showing that electric vehicles aren't going to work for their farmers as well. So they're jumping on board, whether it be seed dealers, ag industry, across the board, we're just seeing more and more support and we're going out and spreading the message, as Julie said, in all these different ways to make sure that people understand the importance and how detrimental it will be if we don't get something passed to break down the barriers that allow for higher blends of ethanol. Julie Busse Yeah, and I'll jump in for just a minute if I can to kind of follow up on that. So one of the figures that we've, you know, been using is that a high octane, low carbon standard like the Next Generation Fuels Act would increase ethanol usage by about 5 billion gallons, which equates to about 1.8 billion bushels of corn. So from a demand perspective, you know, that's why we're so interested in the Next Generation Fuels Act and getting something like this in the marketplace. I'll say, you know, to Bradley's point, I think one of the great things that has been about this year and working on this project is, is that coordination with our state association partners and NCGA. So one of the things that we did back in April, we wanted to be sure that we were all working together on this. And I think one of the great things, you know, Missouri is a great example of this, Kansas, Illinois. Them having some of those conversations on the local level has actually opened the door for us to approach some national organizations that the door wasn't maybe necessarily open to before. So that has been a good part of this process and we've got about 20 to 25 national organizations signed on in support of NGFA and it's something that we're certainly still focused on. We want to continue to expand and grow the tent of partners who are willing to help us promote this piece of legislation. But also as we go into 2024, one of our focuses is going to be getting back into members of Congress and seeing how many more co-sponsors we can get signed on to this legislation. So, certainly have a lot of balls in the air right now with this piece of legislation and it's literally been an all hands on deck approach. And I have to credit our state partners for a lot of that because they've been great working with us on moving this forward. So I'm looking forward to what this next year has to offer. I know it's going to be tough. We have a presidential election and you know how that can be. But I think that if we continue to work together, I think we're going to be able to keep moving and keep the momentum going. Dusty Weis To your point, Julie, I flipped the calendar over the other week and I went, oh, it's an election year again. And that can be either a really bad time to get legislation passed, or it can be a really good time. And particularly when you've got legislators who are going out to their home districts and maybe meeting some people that they haven't met with for a while, legislators like to bring home good news when they're running for reelection. And this certainly seems like a slam dunk piece of good news for farm country out there. But it's worth pointing out as well that this has bipartisan sponsorship in both the Senate and the House. How is that process of getting sponsors coming along? Julie Busse We're getting there. I think one of the things, you know, that we're really focused on, and as I talk about getting more people signed on this next year, is that we're really kind of doing a relationship mapping process. So, like, you know, Bradley's got members of his delegation signed on to NGFA. So who does that person know that might be friends in another state or on a different committee of jurisdiction that we can get signed on? So that's a little bit of, you know, from to your point, Dusty, one of the routes we're going to try to take this year. Dusty Weis Well, and to you Bradley, I guess, why is it so important for this to be bipartisan? Bradley Schad Well, because it's a bipartisan issue. Whenever you look at energy security, there is no greater bipartisan issue of making sure that we have the ability to produce our energy needs here at home and make sure we're protecting our country. I mean, that's ultimately what the Constitution talked about is protecting its citizens. And that's what we've got to do is making sure that we can fuel our vehicles and still be able to operate in a situation that may not be good for the country. So the issue of energy security, there's no bigger issue than to be bipartisan on that. But on top of it you've got rural Democrats, you got rural Republicans, and we've got one representative in the city that sees that it's an issue for the people in their city that can't afford an electric vehicle, but yet he wants to have cleaner air. So that's how we're getting both sides on board. On the rural side it's helping agriculture out, as Scott talked about, helping increase corn grind and so those are all things that people can get around on both sides of the aisle and so that's why it's important to have both sides of the aisle working together. Because ultimately doesn't matter who's in the presidency at the time that we get this past Congress, we've got to have them sign on as well so it's got a that's how we get things done that's how the RFS was passed and that's how we we've got to work on this issue as well. Dusty Weis Well, and they like to say that democracy is not a spectator sport. So if I'm a grower, if I'm a concerned citizen, if I'm a part of one of these groups out there and I'm sitting here thinking, you know what? Next Generation Fuels Act sounds like a pretty good idea, what can I do to get involved and help get this important legislation passed? Bradley Schad Contact your congressman, senators, get onto NCGA. We've got an action website that you can get on and get involved, but just talk to your legislators, talk to your local retailers, say, hey, do you support this? Why don't you? We've got to have liquid fuel in the future. I'm driving a liquid fuel vehicle, and whether that's a hybrid vehicle or just a regular internal combustion engine, they’ve got to have that fuel into the future as we move forward and we all need cleaner air. So talk to everybody that you know of how important this legislation is and to help us get it passed. Julie Busse To follow up on Bradley's point, obviously a lot of our state associations have great information on their websites about the Next Generation Fuels Act, but also, you know, shameless website plug. If you go to NCGA.com/Octane, that is another place with a lot of materials that outline some of the stuff that we've talked about today. Dusty Weis Well, and we'll certainly drop a link to that in the episode description for the podcast as well. But ton of good information here from three very knowledgeable people, and we appreciate you all taking the time to share it. We'll keep our listeners updated as this progresses.

    "content": "The U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced today that it will reopen the Eagle Pass and El Paso rail crossings into Mexico. The announcement pleased leaders at the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), who cautioned the agency against making similar decisions in the future. “This is certainly a welcome relief,” said NCGA President Harold Wolle. “We are very appreciative that CBP was responsive to our calls to have the border crossings re-opened, but we hope this experience serves as a cautionary tale moving forward. Rail is a key mode of transportation for our exports into Mexico, so closing rail crossings can have devastating ramifications for farmers and the economy.” The two rail crossings along the Texas border towns were closed on December 18 by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection as part of an effort to prevent migrants from entering the country illegally. Twenty-five percent of U.S. corn exports into Mexico go through El Paso and Eagle Pass. On Thursday, the National Corn Growers Association joined other national ag groups in sending a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas calling for him to quickly reopen the rail crossings. The crossings will be fully operational by 2 p.m. (EDT) today.",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association is increasing pressure on U.S. officials to reopen the recently closed Eagle Pass and El Paso rail crossings into Mexico. “These closures will have an immediate and prolonged impact on corn exports to Mexico, one of our closest and largest trading partners, during a period of high demand,” NCGA President Harold Wolle said today. “We urge our federal officials to resolve this issue quickly so the flow of goods between the two countries can resume as soon as possible and minimize the damage that has already been done by these abrupt closures.” The two rail crossings along the Texas border towns were closed on December 18 by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection as part of an effort to prevent migrants from entering the country illegally. Twenty-five percent of U.S. corn exports into Mexico go through El Paso and Eagle Pass. On Thursday, the National Corn Growers Association joined other national ag groups in sending a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas calling for him to quickly reopen the rail crossings. “Each day the crossings are closed we estimate almost 1 million bushels of grain exports are potentially lost along with export potential for many other agricultural products,” the letter noted. The letter also argued that the closures could have long-term impacts on U.S. exports. “We are aware of grain trains sitting at origin in at least six states that are unable to move, and we expect this number to grow,” the letter said. “We have also heard of customers in Mexico telling U.S. suppliers they will begin to look to other countries if the U.S. cannot provide a resilient and reliable supply chain.” Mexico was the U.S.’s second largest trading partner in 2022. Mexico relies heavily on America’s grains to feed livestock that is now threatened by the rail closures. Corn grower leaders plan to continue to sound the alarms until the issue is resolved.",

    "title": "Commitment to Water Quality: Growers Voluntary Efforts Bring Progress",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) applauds the sustained reductions in nutrient losses reaching the Gulf of Mexico and the resulting reductions in the average size of the hypoxic zone, as recently documented in the 2023 Report to Congress by the Hypoxia Task Force (HTF). NCGA commends growers for the practical conservation steps and measures they have voluntarily adopted on their farms to reduce nutrient losses and protect water quality. \"In the journey of water quality stewardship, we are encouraged by the strides made by growers,” said Minnesota grower and NCGA Stewardship Action Team Chair Bryan Biegler. “The commitment to sustainable practices is clear, and despite challenging weather patterns impacting growers, we see definite progress taking form over the course of a five-year rolling average. It's a demonstration to the resilience and dedication of the agricultural community in achieving our shared vision for a healthier, more sustainable future.\" According to the HTF’s 2023 report, “[p]rogress to date on reducing nitrogen loads has been strong: the Task Force has met its 2025 interim target to reduce total nitrogen loads by 20 percent. However, total phosphorus loads have increased. More work is needed to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus by 48 percent to meet the HTF’s 2035 goal.” While challenges remain, the commitment of the agricultural community demonstrates dedication to achieving sustainable and lasting improvements. Continued collaboration, research and proactive communication will be keys to ensuring the success of ongoing efforts to reduce the size of the Gulf Hypoxic Zone. \"This progress would not be possible without farmers’ making their own private, voluntary problem-solving commitments to improve nutrient management and resource conservation on their farms,” said NCGA Stewardship and Sustainability Director Rachel Orf. “But in addition to these private, self-funded efforts, federal funding also plays a key role,” she added, noting that “the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act are important sources of support for farmers and the states to work together to implement nutrient reduction strategies and support climate-smart practices. Collaboration is key to achieving lasting progress as we work to address complex environmental challenges.” Established in 1997, the Hypoxia Task Force is comprised of five federal agencies, 12 states bordering the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, and the National Tribal Water Council. The 2023 report emphasizes the enormity of the task in managing water, nitrogen, and phosphorus entering the Gulf of Mexico, covering a vast area across 31 states and two Canadian provinces.",

EPA's decision now puts eight Midwestern states on the road toward allowing for year-round access to E15. “Allowing consumers to access higher blends of ethanol year-round will play a critical role in helping the country meet the Biden administration’s ambitious climate goals,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “We are very appreciative of the EPA for making this science-based and forward-looking decision.” Because of outdated federal regulations, consumers have historically lost access to higher blends of ethanol during the summer months. In April 2022, eight Midwestern governors sent a letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan asking him to provide a permanent fix to this issue by allowing retailers to sell higher blends of ethanol year-round in their states. This week’s announcement by EPA, which was released as a proposed rule that will now advance to the Office of Management and Budget, has been eagerly awaited in the Corn Belt.",

The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) said it is pleased that Treasury is embracing the model. “Given that GREET was created by the U.S. government and is widely respected for its ability to measure reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the farm to the plane, we are encouraged that Treasury will adopt some version of this model,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “At the end of the day, we are eager to help the aviation sector lower its carbon footprint, and we look forward to working with the involved agencies over the coming months to ensure the final model helps us achieve that goal.” The decision by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has been eagerly anticipated since the Inflation Reduction Act was passed in 2022. The law allocates tax credits for biofuels that can demonstrate that they cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% or more. GREET, which stands for the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation, was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy to measure greenhouse emissions from the field to the car or plane.",

This group of farmers put up some impressive yields and proved, once again, the ingenuity and resiliency of the U.S. farmer. In its 59th year, the National Corn Yield Contest saw nearly 7,000 entries from farmers in 46 states. Entrants across the 10 production categories, including the pilot category for nitrogen management, Class J, had verified yields averaging 269 bushels per acre, compared to the projected national average of 173 bushels per acre. This includes a new national record yield of 623.8439 bushels per acre from David Hula in Charles City, VA, besting the previous record of 616.1953 bushels per acre. “Year after year, the National Corn Yield Contest remains the most popular program for NCGA members,” said Harold Wolle, president of the National Corn Growers Association. “It is an opportunity for farmers across the country to put their skills to the test and show the true craftmanship it takes to grow a successful corn crop, and the agronomic data generated by the contest each year helps provide valuable information for future success.” The 27 national, 526 state, and 3 Class J winners will be honored by NCGA at Commodity Classic in Houston, TX, February 28 – March 2, 2024.

    "title": "Agricultural Community to the International Trade Commission: Tariffs on Moroccan Fertilizers Hampering Family Farms",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), along with 57 agriculture organizations including 22 state corn grower groups, urged the U.S. International Trade Commission today to consider the impacts that tariffs on Moroccan shipments of fertilizers are having on family farms. The concerns were expressed in a letter that comes after the ITC was ordered by the U.S. Court of International Trade to reconsider its determination of material injury in a decision issued earlier in September. “Rising prices for fertilizer inputs have strained America’s farmers and ranchers and have impacted availability for this critical component of nutrient and yield management,” the letter said. “Without predictable options to source this product, farmers struggle to plan for the future.” The signatories noted that issues surrounding the international supply chain further complicate farmers’ ability to source phosphate. The letter further explains that the ITC originally made some inferences on the ability to re-ship product that are not indicative of reality. “Agriculture supply chains are intricate and complicated, and the premise that re-shipping product from an originally intended destination to respond to regional demand fluctuations is simply not correct,” the letter said. “Instead, reliance on this incorrect premise has led to high fertilizer costs that create volatility and compromise the ability of farmers to be successful.” The issue leading to the letter stems from a decision by Commerce in 2020 that favored a petition by the U.S.-based Mosaic Company to impose duties on phosphate fertilizers imported from Morocco and Russia. Mosaic had claimed that unfairly subsidized foreign companies were flooding the U.S. market with fertilizers and selling the products at extremely low prices. Meanwhile, phosphate fertilizer prices for farmers were climbing to record highs. Soon after the decision, NCGA launched an aggressive campaign that called on Commerce to reverse the decision and for Mosaic to withdraw its request for tariffs. Over the past three years, NCGA has led the charge to raise concerns by filing an amicus brief, sending letters to the White House and federal agencies, and informing Members of Congress about the impact. In November, as part of an annual review, the U.S. Commerce Department decided to reduce tariffs on the fertilizers from 19.97% to 2.12%, but that decision was retroactive and largely academic as the Moroccan company producing the fertilizers has halted shipping of all but one of its products into the U.S. Efforts to permanently reduce the duties will involve several steps and multiple agencies over the coming months. This month, Commerce will have another opportunity to make the lower duties permanent when it considers a remand on the issue from the U.S. Court of International Trade. Then, in January, the ITC is expected to make a ruling based on another remand ordered by the court. Mosaic can appeal each decision. In the meantime, the recent letter shows that corn growers and their allies continue to sound the alarms by outlining the economic effects of the duties. “Farmers are the lifeblood of our food supply, contributing to our economic strength and the resilience of rural communities,” the letter said. “When burdened with high input costs, farmers see ripple effects occurring in every facet of their operation. This inhibits their ability to increase market access on the global stage and satisfy both local and regional customers.” READ THE LETTER",

    "content": "NCGA and 16 corn state affiliated associations recently joined with over 140 allied national, regional, and state commodity organizations in sending a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack relaying their concerns with the design of the Emergency Relief Program for 2022. While the group expressed appreciation for the allocation of $3.74 billion in much needed ERP assistance to agricultural producers impacted by a wide range of natural disasters in 2022, the signatories said recent changes have raised concerns among farmers. Like previous programs, crop loss payments are generally calculated and factored using crop insurance coverage levels. However, new this year is a “progressive factor” that reduces the disaster assistance for many eligible growers based on the size of the losses. USDA also changed the method used to incorporate producer-paid insurance premiums. The letter took issue with these two changes. “In the case of the progressive payment factor, we oppose a policy that delivers the least amount of benefit to those who have lost the most outside of the payment limits provided in statute,” the letter said. “While we appreciate the funding restraints under which ERP 2022 was developed, we believe that USDA should instead aim to provide more equitable support for losses of all magnitudes. This can be achieved by using a single, uniform factor, as USDA has done in the past.” Growers with questions about the Emergency Relief Program should visit their local Farm Service Agency office for more information about the disaster programs.

But we continue to advocate for a full reauthorization of the farm bill as soon as possible.” The 2018 farm bill, which expired on September 30, authorizes the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s farm and food programs. Late Tuesday night, the House of Representatives bundled the farm bill extension with a continuing resolution to fund the government through early next year. The Senate signaled its support soon after resulting in a vote late Wednesday night. NCGA and our state partners continue to work closely with policymakers to ensure that corn growers’ key priorities are included in the final bill.",

    "title": "Corn Growers Highlight Results of Campaign Against Fertilizer Tariffs",
    "content": "A recent decision by the U.S. Department of Commerce to significantly lower duties placed on phosphate fertilizers imported from Morocco has the potential to provide true savings to farmers while giving them access to crucial inputs that have been scarce over the last couple years, according to a recent analysis by the National Corn Growers Association. The decision comes after an intense advocacy effort by state and national corn grower associations. Commerce decided last week to reduce rates on the imports from 19.97% to 2.12%. While that decision covers duties from November 30, 2020 to December 31, 2021, it could still be an incentive for OCP, the Moroccan company that manufactures the products, to reenter the U.S. market. Growers say it is a big step in the right direction. “The decision is very meaningful to us,” said Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Harold Wolle. “Farmers were already facing rate hikes on inputs and the duties were making the situation worse. This decision gives us a lot of hope.” Commerce’s decision stems from an annual administrative review of the duties it imposes. The agency is again set to consider the rate on the same duties on December 13. That review was ordered by the U.S. Court of International Trade after receiving a complaint filed by OCP. Assuming Commerce finalizes the duty rates in that case and imports resume, farmers could see a reduction in added cost of $7 per acre on imported fertilizer from Morocco, according to NCGA's analysis. Many factors and dynamics contribute to changes in fertilizer markets and prices, but the imposed duty rates undoubtedly had an impact on the prices paid by farmers. Rewind to two years ago, say advocates, and the situation looked far more dire. Not only had The Mosaic Company managed to convince Commerce to place duties on phosphate fertilizers from Morocco, but CF Industries had also filed a petition with the same agency calling for duties on urea ammonium nitrate solution imported from Russia and Trinidad & Tobago. The situation was creating havoc for corn growers and a plan was soon hatched by NCGA and state corn grower groups to launch a campaign that would push back on the tariffs. “We appealed to Congress, the administration and directly to Commerce,” said Wolle. “We had high-profile policymakers writing letters. We worked with the press, and we had farmers providing direct testimony on how the duties were hurting them, their farms and the rural communities. It was a fierce and sustained advocacy effort that was heard all over Washington, D.C.” The efforts paid off. In mid-2022, Commerce ruled against CF Industries’ petition to impose tariffs on nitrogen fertilizers imported from Russia and Trinidad and Tobago. That was more than a year before Commerce would make its decision on phosphate fertilizer imports. “This type of stellar advocacy campaign would not have been possible if not for the help our members,” Wolle said. “They raised their voices and decision-makers listened. It shows the power of membership in organizations like NCGA who exist to support the American farmer.” Read New Analysis on Economic Impact of Decision",

    "title": "In Big Win for Corn Growers, Commerce Significantly Lowers Duties on Phosphate Fertilizers",
    "content": "The U.S. Department of Commerce today announced it was lowering duties placed on phosphate fertilizers imported from Morocco from 19.97% to 2.12%. The decision comes after the agency conducted an administrative review of the duties, which is performed annually by retroactively examining the price of shipments and other factors. The National Corn Growers Association, which has been vocal opponent of the duties, applauded the decision, calling it a big win for corn growers. “This victory was made possible by corn growers across the country who spoke out against these duties as they faced skyrocketing fertilizer prices and product shortages at the behest of The Mosaic Company,” said NCGA President Harold Wolle. “While the best duty on fertilizers is no duty at all, we are nonetheless thrilled that corn growers bearing the brunt of these tariffs will feel financial relief thanks to this decision.” The issue stems from a decision by Commerce in 2020 that favored a petition by the U.S.-based Mosaic to impose duties on phosphate fertilizers imported from Morocco and Russia. Mosaic had claimed that unfairly subsidized foreign companies were flooding the U.S. market with fertilizers and selling the products at extremely low prices. Soon after the decision, NCGA launched an aggressive campaign that called on Commerce to reverse the decision and for Mosaic to withdraw its request for tariffs. Over the past three years, NCGA has led the charge to raise concerns by filing an amicus brief, sending a letter to the White House, and informing Members of Congress about the impact. In October of this year, the National Corn Growers Association – along with 62 other agricultural groups, including state corn grower organizations – sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo calling on her to consider the current difficulties faced by farmers as she recalculates duties on phosphate fertilizer imported from Morocco. That letter and previous actions by corn growers culminated in today’s decision. In a separate matter, in September, Commerce was ordered by the U.S. Court of International Trade to reconsider the duty rate calculation because of flaws found in Commerce’s analysis. A decision on that matter is expected on Dec. 13.",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) applauded Secretary Tom Vilsack’s announcement today that his agency is releasing $1.3 billion in funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to support trade promotion to diversify and develop markets for commodities and specialty crop industries. Vilsack’s decision, which will help growers break into new markets in Asia and Africa, was strongly supported and encouraged by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Ranking Member John Boozman (R-Ark.). “To remain competitive globally, American farmers need our policymakers to make the necessary investments that will help ensure a strong global market for our crops,” said NCGA President Harold Wolle. “We are deeply appreciative of Secretary Vilsack as well as Sens. Stabenow and Boozman for making this funding a reality.” Analysis has shown that for every $1 invested in export market development, exports are increased by $24.50, according to USDA. The funding comes as NCGA pushes for increased investments for two key trade programs: the Market Access Program, which provides support in marketing activities abroad, and Foreign Market Development, which helps create and maintain long-term export markets. MAP's authorized funding has not changed since 2006 and FMD funding has remained the same since 2002. “It has been almost 20 years since we have had an increase in funding for these crucial trade programs,” Wolle said. “We are falling behind other countries that are being more aggressive in their international market development programs. This announcement is welcome news, but it is equally crucial that Congress increases funding for MAP and FMD as it reauthorizes the farm bill.” NCGA partners closely with the United States Grains Council to develop trade markets for corn globally.",

    "title": "Consider Corn Challenge IV Winners Announced",
    "content": "At yesterday’s Advanced Bioeconomy Leadership 2023 Conference in San Francisco, California, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) announced the winners of the Consider Corn Challenge IV. Four winners were chosen, each with a unique way to improve a product or process using feed corn to produce biobased materials. “The Consider Corn Challenge fosters innovative collaborations between corn farmers and industry, which paves the way for new products, chemicals and applications. This year’s winners have continued to demonstrate corn’s adaptability,” said Director of Market Development Sarah McKay. “And corn’s unique versatility can be witnessed in the showcase of their diverse approaches and applications. This contest continues to highlight the fact that U.S. corn is an extremely flexible feedstock suited for biobased products.” The four winners for the Consider Corn Challenge IV are Bluestem Biosciences Inc., based out of Omaha, Nebraska; Pennsylvania State University, located in the state’s University City; Nexceris, headquartered in Lewis Center, Ohio; and Maizly, whose U.S. office is located in Phoenix, Arizona. Bluestem Biosciences, Inc. has developed novel yeast biology for the sustainable anaerobic bio-production of 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), a chemical intermediate for the acrylates chemical family, a $25B total addressable market. This strategic platform molecule serves a variety of consumer end markets, like personal care products, paints and coatings. Bluestem will leverage its novel yeast biology through the retrofit of underutilized existing shuttered ethanol production facilities across the U.S. Bluestem’s anaerobic biology is intended to mimic ethanol production, creating numerous economic benefits while supporting the rural Midwest bioeconomy and agricultural communities. Additionally, Bluestem’s technology reduces dependence on petroleum for feedstock currently used in chemical production and relies on corn as the primary feedstock, while reshoring supply chains back to the United States. Pennsylvania State University's technology utilizes both corn starch and corn oil for applications in energy storage in lithium batteries. Corn starch will be evaluated for conversion into both hard and soft carbons; corn oil will be evaluated for conversion into a soft carbon. The carbon materials will be characterized for structure by a suite of material characterization methods, including transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. Nexceris has developed a new sugar-to-chemicals process that uses renewable dextrose to make industrial chemicals, instead of oil or gas, and can cut CO2 emissions by greater than 85%. Sugar2X uses state-of-the-art reactors and a new catalyst design to operate continuously on a dextrose, a domestic, renewable feedstock, with established rail transport, and clean H2 from electricity. The technology also strongly benefits American farmers and rural communities by converting sugars to renewable chemical products that can be cost-competitive with existing fossil-based processes, allowing market forces to improve commodity corn prices and demand that drives this value stream. Maizly has developed the world’s first corn-based milk alternative, called Maizly Original. Not only does Maizly Original look like dairy milk, but it has a similar mouthfeel to dairy milk and a complementary taste profile so as not to impact the flavor of the underlying beverage or cereal. Not only can Maizly Original froth for your cappuccino and white your tea or coffee, but it is also perfect for baking with. Maizly Original contains less sugar yet more calcium, as well as vitamins A, D and E, and added chickpea protein. Being lactose-, gluten-, and allergen-free, Maizly Original is \"Available to All.\" “Finding new uses for corn is a key priority for NCGA,” said Ohio farmer and Market Development Action Team Vice Chair Dennis Vennekotter. “The Consider Corn Challenge provides a unique opportunity to harness the potential of corn as a versatile, sustainable feedstock. It not only showcases the ingenuity of participants but also fosters vital collaborations between industry and corn producers, paving the way for innovative, market-driven solutions.” The total prize pool for the fourth iteration of the contest was U.S. $250,000. Each of the four winners received $62,500.",

    "title": "Corn Grower Leaders, Other Ag Groups, Caution Commerce Secretary About Fertilizer Duties",
    "content": "Saying fertilizer shortages are creating a hardship for farmers across the U.S., the National Corn Growers Association – along with 62 other agricultural groups, including state corn grower organizations – sent a letter today to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo calling on her to consider the current difficulties faced by farmers as she recalculates duties on phosphate fertilizer imported from Morocco. The letter comes after the U.S. Court of International Trade ordered the agency to reconsider its previous decision on calculating the duties. “High costs and limited availability of fertilizer continue to strain family farms across the United States,” the letter said. “[We] urge you to consider the impact of phosphate duties as the Department of Commerce works to reconsider its duty rate calculation.” The duties levied on fertilizes have caused one of the U.S.’s top importers of certain phosphate fertilizers, the Moroccan-based OCP Group, to drastically reduce U.S. imports over the last few years, even on products not sold in this country or easily attained by American farmers. As the letter explains, these developments are having a financial impact on farmers. “Duties levied on phosphate imports combined with these other factors have led to substantial price volatility over the past three years as evident by phosphate price increases of over 230% from 2020 to 2022,” according to the letter signatories. “During 2022, farmers spent $36.9 billion on fertilizer and lime, compared to $24.4 billion in 2020.” The issue originated in February 2021 when Commerce called on the International Trade Commission to implement duties of almost 20% on imported fertilizers from Morocco after the Mosaic Company, which manufactures fertilizers used in the U.S. and abroad, filed a petition with the department seeking the levies. The ITC voted in March of that year to impose the duties while adding similar levies on Russian imports. Soon after, NCGA and state corn grower groups launched a full campaign to raise awareness among policymakers, including members of Congress and administration officials, about the impact the duties would have on farmers. The organization worked with the media and provided written statements and farmer testimony on the matter. The court’s recent ruling to remand Commerce’s decision was seen as a partial win by grower leaders, but advocates say for farmers to be successful, trade barriers must be eliminated completely. “American agriculture must have market access to compete globally, and a major impediment like a fertilizer duty only undermines the ability to establish and expand markets,” the letter noted. Absent delays, Commerce is expected to finalize its administrative review by November 1, and issue its remand determination by December 13. READ THE LETTER",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) announces a new round of research grants to help farmers manage aflatoxin issues. Proposals from principal investigators, co-principal investigators, and collaborators—and not exceeding the $100,000 per year limit—will be accepted by the Aflatoxin Mitigation Center of Excellence (AMCOE) no later than Wednesday, November 15, 2023. For more information about the review process, evaluation criteria and program eligibility, click here. AMCOE’s Competitive Grants Program offers research grants for projects focused on solving profit-robbing aflatoxin issues for farmers. The program was developed by a consortium of southern state corn checkoff boards to provide a unified approach to funding projects affecting growers across the region. NCGA serves as the management structure in order to leverage more dollars for solving aflatoxin issues and to build strong regional teams which would be highly competitive for federal, public, and private funding. “Corn growers are committed to helping deliver the safest, highest-quality products to consumers,\" noted Texas grower and AMCOE Committee Chair Charles Ring. \"Through the AMCOE’s endeavors, we've gained substantial ground in understanding and mitigating aflatoxin and other mycotoxins. Our competitive grants program is advancing successful aflatoxin research and offering enhanced tools and outcomes for our industry.” Projects funded through AMCOE’s grant program for 2024 should focus on one of these three priority research areas: Methodologies and technologies that prevent and/or defend against the presence of aflatoxin In-field mitigation measures Post-harvest strategies While corn farmers in southern states experience aflatoxin challenges every year, these challenges may present themselves in any corn region of the United States when the crop comes under stress. Therefore, the benefits of such research—particularly as outlined in the three priority areas—are truly national in scope. Proposals will be considered regardless of the party’s geographic region. Any state wishing to provide additional funding for AMCOE is encouraged to do so.",

    "title": "Groups Call on NHTSA to Rethink Proposed CAFE Standards that Weaken Energy Security",
    "content": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s proposed new fuel economy standards “greatly missed the intent” of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy program to enhance energy security, according to technical comments filed today by the National Corn Growers Association, Renewable Fuels Association and National Farmers Union. The proposal, they assert, will lead to an overreliance on foreign critical minerals due to its myopic dependence on electric vehicles. “As NHTSA determines the appropriate CAFE and fuel efficiency standards, it should avoid putting all our eggs in the electrification basket,” the three national trade associations wrote. “NHTSA’s current proposal greatly missed the intent of the CAFE program. As Congress has acknowledged, solving energy security and air pollution issues related to the transportation sector requires a diversified portfolio of approaches.” The associations noted an overreliance on electric vehicles that ignores specific challenges of these new vehicles, such as “the increased energy security vulnerabilities flowing from the critical minerals needed for electric vehicle batteries,” as well as the feasibility of the auto industry to produce sufficient volumes, secure needed critical mineral supplies and develop an appropriate workable charging station infrastructure. The comments conclude with a call on NHTSA to work with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reinstitute strong incentives for flex fuel vehicles that use lower-carbon, American-made ethanol. “Whether FFVs currently run on gasoline or E85, building up the portion of the fleet capable of running on E85 gives the country an additional option to address potential future oil or critical mineral crises in a way that can protect our national security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” the comments state. “Given vehicles’ long useful life, EPA and NHTSA should not wait for a crisis to incentivize FFVs. It will be too late to act if they are suddenly needed to address a crisis. Instead, the country should plan ahead and build fuel diversity into the system now.”",

During a press conference today, Wolle talked about his goals over the next year, saying reauthorizing a farm bill that reflects the priorities of corn growers will be a pressing concern. He also noted that he plans to push for support of the Next Generation Fuels Act in the House and Senate while making ethanol a go-to biofuel in the aviation sector. “My theme as president is ‘shaping the Future,’ and nothing shapes the future like effective advocacy,” Wolle said. “And no other group does advocacy as well as our state corn grower groups and NCGA.” Wolle has deep experience in many issues important to corn growers, having served on NCGA committees and the organization’s board, including as a board liaison to the National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Advisory Board. He is also past president of the Minnesota Corn Growers Association. Wolle said NCGA has the relationships and the clout to effect change on behalf of corn growers. “As a membership organization with 37,000 dues-paying corn grower members that represents some 300,000 growers who contribute through corn checkoff programs in their states, we are well positioned to make a difference,” he said. “I plan to rally our growers this year as we work on these pressing issues.” NCGA’s board elects a member of the board to serve as president each year. The term begins in early October, the start of NCGA’s fiscal year. Tom Haag, the organization’s immediate past president who also hails from Minn., will now serve as chairman of the board.

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) this week launched a grassroots advocacy campaign to encourage the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to provide a level playing field for biofuels such as ethanol. The organization is calling on corn growers and advocates to make their voices heard by submitting comments to the agency. The campaign comes after NHTSA proposed hiking the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard, referred to as the CAFE standard, which regulates how much fuel a vehicle consumes per mile. The agency’s current proposal would move the fleet average for small cars and light trucks from 44 to 58 miles per gallon by 2032. NCGA leaders said the proposed standard ignores solutions that are available now. “The proposal sets an unattainable goal and a concerning precedent,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “As a result, auto manufacturers will be forced to overlook viable solutions, such as high-octane biofuels like corn ethanol, as they rush to meet these standards. This would significantly minimize the role biofuels play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving consumers money at the pump.” Haag says this proposed rule largely mirrors the recent tailpipe emissions proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency and it is important to have a strong showing from those who understand the role biofuels can play in emissions reduction. NHTSA will hold a hearing later this week where it will accept public comments on the proposed standard. The comment period closes October 16, 2023.",

    "content": "The CEO of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) today pushed back against commentary made by a science advisory board to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that questioned the effectiveness of ethanol in lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The NCGA leader's comments were made during a public meeting held by the SAB. “There is no shortage of studies on the environmental benefits of corn ethanol,” NCGA CEO Neil Caskey told the advisory board members. “The Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory, for example, has conducted extensive research on the matter and concluded that corn ethanol has reduced greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. by 544 million metric tons from 2005- 2019, and that the feedstock’s carbon intensity is 44% lower than that of petroleum gasoline.” The testimony comes after the SAB provided commentary to the EPA administrator raising doubts about the effectiveness of ethanol. The SAB is comprised of experts representing a range of fields who make regular recommendations to EPA leaders. Caskey recently sent a letter to the EPA administrator challenging the commentary. Caskey also responded to assertions by the SAB that the production of ethanol impacts land use, noting that the data show that as corn production has risen, land used to grow corn has not. “American farmers planted an estimated 94.1 million acres of corn in 2023, which falls short of the more than 100 million acres corn farmers planted a century ago,” Caskey noted. “In the past decade, U.S. corn production has been over six times the production of the 1930s with fewer corn acres.” The testimony is the latest in a series of actions NCGA has taken to defend and promote ethanol. The organization has also been encouraging the Biden administration to take the necessary steps to ensure that the aviation sector is able to use the important biofuel.",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) sent a letter this week to the Environmental Protection Agency addressing recent concerns raised by the agency’s scientific advisory board about the environmental benefits of ethanol. In a letter sent to EPA Administrator Michael Regan on Thursday, NCGA CEO Neil Caskey noted that the research shows unequivocally that ethanol is important to addressing climate change. “There are no shortage of studies on the environmental benefits of corn ethanol,” Caskey said. “The Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory, for example, has conducted extensive research on the matter and concluded that corn ethanol has reduced GHG emissions in the U.S. by 544 million metric tons from 2005- 2019 and that the feedstock’s carbon intensity is 44 percent lower than that of petroleum gasoline.” The letter was sent after EPA’s scientific advisory board submitted draft commentary on the Volume Requirements for 2023 and Beyond under the Renewable Fuel Standard Program. In the commentary, the advisory board questions ethanol’s ability to significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions and raises concerns that the production of ethanol increases land use. The letter noted that corn growers are doing more with less land. “American farmers planted an estimated 94.1 million acres of corn in 2023, which falls short of the more than 100 million acres corn farmers planted a century ago,” Caskey noted. “In the past decade, U.S. corn production has been over six times the production of the 1930s with fewer corn acres.” Caskey also highlighted ethanol’s importance in advancing the Biden administration’s climate agenda. “It is important to note that any decision that hampers the use of these environmentally friendly products would complicate President Biden’s ambitious climate goals, which will almost certainly require the use of biofuels, such as corn ethanol, to be successful,” he said. Caskey will provide verbal remarks before the SAB later this month. READ THE LETTER",

    "title": "Corn Grower Leaders Call on Biden Administration to Tie U.S. Tax Decisions on Aviation Biofuels to Governments Emissions Model",
    "content": "Asserting that U.S. tax policy should be tied to the best standards the government has to offer, 17 of the nation’s top corn grower leaders sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen today encouraging her to adopt an emissions model developed by the Department of Energy as her agency works with the Internal Revenue Service to determine which biofuels lower greenhouse gas emissions enough to qualify for sustainable aviation fuel tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. The letter, which was signed by the president of the National Corn Growers Association and the leaders from state grower groups across the country, calls on Treasury to use an emissions standard referred to as the GREET model, which was developed by the DOE, rather than a less comprehensive international standard preferred by some groups. “GREET is the federal government’s most robust and updated model or methodology for transportation lifecycle assessment,” the letter says. “It is used globally to measure lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, and the DOE has the best resources, expertise, and current ability within federal government agencies to assess lifecycle emissions accurately and scientifically.” Unlike other models, GREET considers the full environmental picture, the corn growers noted. “The GREET model accurately accounts for on-farm carbon reduction activities and feedstock yield increases and the improved agriculture production practices that farmers have adopted over the last twenty years,” the letter says. “This further solidifies GREET as the methodology Treasury and the IRS should use to determine tax credits for SAF under the IRA.” The letter comes as corn ethanol, which has been used for years to lower greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks while saving consumers money at the pump, is being considered for use in the aviation arena where experts say the biofuel would do for airplanes what it has done for autos. But as corn grower leaders point out, the tax credit from the IRA will be crucial to ensuring ethanol is quickly made available in the aviation sector. A decision on that tax credit could come down to which emissions model is used to determine greenhouse gas emission reductions. Citing a recent speech in which President Biden said farmers will lead the way on aviation biofuels, the letter notes, “If we are going to make the president’s promise a reality, we are going to have to have a reliable model in place and one that bases U.S. tax policy on the best information and instruments the U.S. government has to offer.” Yellen is expected to make a final announcement on the tax credits this month.

Boozman and Stabenow for taking the lead on this issue. Both senators have proven time and time again that they are staunch advocates of corn growers.” The letter provided a roadmap to USDA on how to fund market development programs and explore opportunities to advance food assistance initiatives. “As Congress works toward reauthorizing critical programs in the Farm Bill, we continue to hear from organizations representing the vast majority of U.S. agriculture about the need to strengthen trade opportunities, increase revenue streams, and help producers grow and thrive in a global economy,” the letter said. “Farm Bill trade promotion programs help address these needs and build new markets. We believe that resources available under the CCC can support similar efforts to open accesss to markets and promote American-grown products abroad.” The Commodity Credit Corporation funds are used by the government to implement specific programs established by or to carry out activities under the broad authorities of the CCC Charter Act.

    "content": "National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) President Tom Haag testified today before an Environmental Protection Agency Scientific Advisory Panel about the importance of atrazine to corn farmers. “NCGA commends the scientific and risk-based analysis and conclusions of the EPA in this reevaluation of the 11 atrazine studies identified by the 2012 Scientific Advisory Panel as calling for further review to assess the effects to aquatic plant communities,” Haag noted in the testimony. “NCGA points to the conclusions in the white paper, which continue to affirm scientific evidence which supports the safe use of atrazine while protecting the vital aquatic plant communities and their related ecosystems.” The purpose of the SAP is to seek feedback on the draft white paper, Examination of the Microcosm/Mesocosm Studies for Evaluating the Effects of Atrazine on Aquatic Plant Communities, which is being submitted to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act SAP for peer review. During the hearing, Haag touched on the positive environmental benefits of using atrazine. “Effective management of weeds and their resistance to herbicides is a constant challenge to corn farmers,” he said. “Access to atrazine puts an important tool in the hands of U.S. corn growers to effectively adopt conservation practices while managing destructive weeds and delivering an abundant and quality crop. NCGA advocated for EPA to hold this SAP because atrazine is critical to thousands of farmers and millions of acres, it is imperative that EPA fully reviews the complete library of science related to atrazine and the aquatic plant community.” EPA expects to receive the SAP’s report in late November.",

    "title": "NCGA Applauds USTR for Requesting USMCA Panel Formation Over Trade Dispute",
    "content": "The U.S. Trade Representative today requested a panel formation under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement over Mexico’s decision to ban imports of biotech corn used for human consumption. Leaders at the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) said they are highly supportive of the move. “Mexico’s decree, which runs counter to scientific findings and is in direct violation of USMCA, is negatively impacting American corn growers,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “U.S. officials have exhausted every avenue trying to resolve this conflict and are left with no other choice but to turn to a third-party panel in hopes of quickly rectifying this issue. We are deeply appreciative of USTR for standing up for America’s corn growers.” If USTR’s request is granted, a group of objective experts will be empaneled to hear the case and make a final determination based on the commitments both parties signed as part of the free trade agreement. The dispute stems from a 2020 decree by Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador that sought to ban imports of biotech corn beginning in January 2024. Mexico issued a revised decree in February of this year that banned biotech corn for human consumption effective immediately and left the door open for a future ban on biotech corn for feed. Mexico is a top market for corn, the number one agricultural export from the U.S., which has led to strong concerns over how the ban would impact U.S. farmers, rural economies and food security for the people of Mexico. Given the high stakes, NCGA and corn grower leaders across the country began sounding the alarm last fall and have been calling on the Biden administration to initiate a dispute settlement under USMCA.",

    "content": "The farmer-led, farmer-driven initiative offers cost-share programs and technical assistance to farmers in 20 states who plant cover crops for three years. Farmers in 20 states can now enroll in cost-share programs through Farmers for Soil Health. This corn, pork and soy commodity initiative, in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and USDA’s Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, establishes financial and technical assistance for corn and soybean farmers who adopt cover crops. The focus is to bring money directly back to farmers, where sustainability is happening at the farm level. Participating farmers who plant cover crops will receive payments to help transition totaling $50 (spanning three years) per new acre of cover crops planted. These payments of $2 per acre are available for up to 600,000 acres of existing cover crops. Eligible farmers will participate in measurement, reporting, and verification to highlight progress toward the goal of expanding adoption of cover crops. “NCGA is excited to offer this opportunity in partnership with our state partners and affiliated organizations,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “This is just one more way for growers to continue their soil health and conservation journeys, and now with the opportunity to tap into technical and financial support as they implement new practices.” Farmers can enroll at farmersforsoilhealth.com. Farmers in Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin are eligible for enrollment. A hallmark of the program is the simplicity of enrollment and monitoring. Farmers will be able to enroll quickly and easily through the online enrollment platform, and all the monitoring/verification is done remotely via satellites. “As farmers continue to experience and adjust to extreme weather swings, they can, through the Farmers for Soil Health initiative, adopt conservation measures like cover crops to increase crop resiliency,” said Ben West, Farmers for Soil Health executive director. “Through regional technical assistance led by the state corn, pork, and soy commodity organizations, U.S. farmers will strengthen their best management practices as they feed and fuel an expanding population while protecting the environment.” Farmers for Soil Health is a collaboration between the National Corn Growers Association, National Pork Board and United Soybean Board. Its goal is to advance conservation practices to improve soil health across the U.S., including doubling cover crop acres in the U.S. to 30 million acres by 2030. The primary purpose is to deliver examples-based, science-focused initiatives recognizing farmers nationwide. For more information on Farmers for Soil Health, visit farmersforsoilhealth.com.

    "content": "Here at the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), we know that champions are forged not just in the wins, but also in the legacy they leave with the land. The National Corn Yield Contest (NCYC) is a legacy like no other and there is still time to enter your name in the contest’s fifty-ninth year. And your NCYC entry—your contribution to the contest—is what makes the difference. By adapting new practices, adopting new technologies and pushing for that next personal benchmark to do-more-with-less, America’s corn farmers are paving a path forward to help feed and fuel a growing world. The contest isn’t just about forging yield-busting champions, but also about creating a strong network of corn growers who have the knowledge, experience and grit to preserve each season no matter what challenges it may bring. It’s this network that commits each year to give their all and strives to set a new personal best so that future generations can carry the legacy onward and upward. “The National Corn Yield Contest isn’t just about winning; it is also about storytelling,” said NCGA President and Minnesota farmer Tom Haag. “And corn has a very valuable story of continuous, historical progress to tell. Each year that we have growers participate in the contest, we weave together another impressive chapter to put in the books—and it reads about winning and persevering and pushing forward.” And for growers looking to push forward with new opportunities within the contest, this year’s Nitrogen Management (Class J) pilot allows corn growers to continue experimenting with practices that reduce inputs to optimize economics and environmental stewardship. The pilot parameters are simple—growers decide what nitrogen forms to use and when to apply, but the total nitrogen applied must be 180 pounds or less. Pilot participation is limited to the first 100 growers located in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, or Wisconsin. So now is the time: Make the commitment! Contribute to 2023’s chapter in the NCYC story. Entry for all classes—including the new pilot class—is open until Wednesday, August 16.

    "content": "Every summer, Nebraska Corn Growers Association/Nebraska Corn Board sponsors two interns to work at the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) offices in Washington, D.C. and St. Louis. This year, the two interns selected were Lexi Bodlak and Hannah Roebke. With just two weeks left before their internships end, and on this National Intern Day, they share reflections on their time with NCGA. “I am grateful for the opportunity to jump start my career in agricultural policy in the private sector with the National Corn Growers Association. Nebraska Corn Board staff saw something in me that I’m still not sure I see in myself, but I’m working on finding it. As I embrace the grey areas and major question marks with my next internship, I will tell my own story with just as much confidence as I do the agriculturists and professionals that I was fortunate enough to meet this summer,” said Bodlak. “I know you must be at least 25 years old to be a member of Congress, so that percentage of government officials with an agricultural background might stay the same for a few more years, but not for long. Rest assured, there is a whole generation of agricultural leaders like myself that are ready to make a difference in the lives of farmers and the rest of the country by putting pen to paper.” Lexi and Hannah had the opportunity to work together during the summer, even though in different offices. The first was at the third annual Women and Mentor’s Retreat. Both interns also got to work together while attending Corn Congress in Washington, D.C. They both sat in on the Membership and Consumer Engagement Action Team (MCEAT) meeting and took over the Nebraska Corn social media pages for a couple days. Lobbying Nebraska congressmen on Capitol Hill as well as enjoying dinner with other Nebraska Corn members and staff were memorable highlights of the event. “It was fun to connect with Lexi again and hear about her summer in D.C. while also expanding my leadership skills and connecting with other women in ag,” said Roebke. On one of the nights, Hannah and Lexi went to the Fall Out Boy Concert in St. Louis. It was a great opportunity to hang out and connect on a more personal level. “When I applied for an internship with Nebraska Corn and NCGA last Fall, I honestly just wanted to give communications for a company a try. My previous internships have been at news stations working in broadcast news as well as with Husker athletics working with content creation and livestream video work, so I wanted to try corporate communications and see what that realm was like,” said Roebke. \"Now as my time comes to an end, I can say that I am glad I gave corporate communications a chance. This past summer has been an amazing experience and has taught me so much. It has been nice to get exposure to social media content creation and management, farm video shoots, Corn Congress, and everything in between. I am thankful that I got to work with such a passionate group of people and continue to share the story of agriculture with consumers.” Overall, this summer has been a great opportunity for both college students. Hannah and Lexi plan to stay in contact throughout the year and continue to advocate for agriculture. They thank Nebraska Corn and NCGA for this opportunity.",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) released a video series featuring corn growers across the nation sharing their personal stories about how the farm bill affects their operations. The videos were unveiled at Corn Congress, which was held recently in Washington, D.C. The series features four farmers: Elizabeth Hinkle of Ashland, Pa.; Aaron Martinka of Holland, Texas; Brent Rogers of Hoxie, Kan.; and Eric Tipton of Jeffersonville, Ohio. These NCGA members shared the importance of crop insurance, trade, farm safety net programs and USDA conservation programming. NCGA’s Vice President of Public Policy Brooke S. Appleton noted the goal of the project was to help directly communicate with policymakers and their staff about the importance of the farm bill to corn growers and their families. “Nearly half of the members of the House of Representatives were not around during the debate on the 2018 farm bill,” Appleton said. “We have known for some time that new member education would be key to our comprehensive advocacy efforts on the farm bill. This video series is a great way to bring the story of corn growers to Capitol Hill—especially those who are new to Washington.” The farm bill is typically reauthorized every five years and is the core piece of legislation governing many of the U.S. Department of Agriculture programs critical to farmers. The current bill is set to expire on September 30, 2023. With the deadline quickly approaching, NCGA encourages advocates to contact their congressional representatives. “The farm bill is our Super Bowl,” said NCGA’s Director of PAC and Political Strategy Anne Thompson. “It is critical corn growers share perspective with their elected officials and send a unified message to Capitol Hill as the bill is being developed. Every voice is important.” To view NCGA’s farm bill video series, click here and to participate in NCGA’s call-to-action on the reauthorization of the farm bill, click here.",

    "title": "Brazils Uptick in Corn Exports Not Necessarily Indicative of Trend, Ag Economist Says",
    "content": "While Brazil is positioned to surpass the U.S. in corn exports this year, the data don’t indicate the trend leading to this development will necessarily continue, as the South American country faces many challenges when it comes to agriculture and trade, a national ag economist said today. “U.S. exports have been hindered by droughts that have affected key areas of the Corn Belt,” NCGA Lead Economist Krista Swanson said. “But the U.S. has several relative advantages in the global corn market that can be harnessed to support our $90 billion corn industry.” The U.S. is bolstered by far superior infrastructure and sustainable farming practices, Swanson noted. For example, she said Brazil is 86.6% of the size of the entire United States but has just 25% of the roadway miles found in this country, of which only 12.4% are paved. Nearly 70% of roadway miles are paved in the U.S. The comments were made during a joint press conference hosted by the National Corn Growers Association and the U.S. Grains Council and come as reports show that Brazil is on pace to surpass the U.S. in corn exports this year. Swanson was joined at the press conference by U.S. Grains Council Vice President Cary Sifferath, who addressed potential new markets that could be cultivated for U.S. corn growers. In addition to listing the strengths U.S. corn growers bring to the table, Swanson also highlighted some of Brazil’s limitations. “While there is additional pasture area available for cropland expansion in the country, efforts are also underway to rein in deforestation of valuable rainforest that is critical to global sustainability,” Swanson said. “In the U.S., by contrast, farmers have used innovation to sustainably increase production of corn over time with a finite land area.” NCGA has called on Congress to double funding in the farm bill for important trade programs, such as the Market Access Program and the Foreign Market Development Program. MAP is designed to encourage development, maintenance and expansion of commercial markets for U.S. agricultural exports. FMD is a joint government and agri-industry effort to develop markets by acquainting potential foreign customers with U.S. farm products. The final data on trade exports from both countries for the 2022-2023 market year will be released in September. Read the white paper on this issue here.",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) today joined over 90 other trade groups representing diverse businesses across the transportation sector in urging the Biden administration to reverse course on its proposed tailpipe emissions standards for light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles. In a letter to President Biden, the organizations outlined significant concerns with the EPA’s proposed rules and the need to preserve consumers’ access to affordable, reliable and efficient transportation. “We share the goal of reduced greenhouse gas emissions across the broader economy and, specifically, those from energy production, transportation, and use by society,” the letter states. “EPA’s proposals inhibit the marketplace from identifying the most efficient, lowest cost opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from vehicles and greatly restrict consumer choice. We are concerned that such a prescriptive policy is not in the best interest of the consumer or of U.S. energy and economic security.” The letter also expressed concerns with EPA’s narrow focus on electric vehicles to achieve compliance and highlighted the benefits of evaluating a broader range of emissions reductions pathways. “A diversified portfolio of vehicle and fuel technologies that meets the multitude of transportation needs of Americans and makes meaningful GHG reductions can be achieved while also allowing new zero-emission vehicle, and specifically battery electric vehicle, technologies to advance,” the signatories wrote. “Improved crop yield, innovative biofuel and refined product processing, and manufacturing efficiency tied with carbon capture each represent promising advancements for current liquid and gaseous fuels to continue to accelerate emissions reductions.” Brooke S. Appleton, NCGA vice president of public policy, participated in a press conference on the issue today with leaders from the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers. The group talked about the letter and called on the Biden administration to be more inclusive of ethanol and other environmental solutions as it finalizes the proposal. NCGA and state corn grower leaders have worked to educate EPA about how biofuels can help the Biden administration meet its environmental goals. NCGA submitted comments to EPA and its grassroots advocate network sent more than 2,822 letters to the EPA during the comment period.

    "content": "Nancy Martinez, a seasoned Capitol Hill professional with extensive policy experience, has joined the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) as director of public policy for trade. NCGA leaders say Martinez will bring great value to the organization. “We are thrilled to have someone of Nancy’s caliber join our team,” said Brooke S. Appleton, NCGA’s vice president of public policy. “Her experience and carefully cultivated relationships with key members of the House and Senate will be crucially important to advancing the trade priorities of the nation’s corn growers.” Martinez comes to NCGA from the office of Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), where she spent six years handling trade, agriculture, education, labor and pension issues. Trade is a marquee issue for Young who serves on the Senate Finance Committee. Martinez started her career working for Young when he was a House member. She has also served as an advisor on health and education policy for Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.). She said she is pleased to now be putting her experience to work for corn growers. “I look forward to combining my public policy experience with my love of agriculture to advocate on behalf of America’s corn growers,” Martinez said. “This is an exciting time in the trade arena as we debate the farm bill, talk about investing in new markets and work to address trade impediments.” A native Hoosier, Martinez holds a B.A. in political science and religious studies from Indiana University.",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) launched a campaign today that encourages advocates and allies to contact their congressional delegation about the importance of passing a bipartisan, comprehensive farm bill in 2023 that will support and protect the corn industry. NCGA president, Tom Haag, noted the importance of this opportunity and the need for corn growers to send a strong, unified message to Capitol Hill. “Farm bills only come around every five years. Sandwiched between legal jargon and formalities is language that directly affects the operations and livelihoods of corn growers,” said Haag. “This bill funds programs that help us stay in business in the tough years; support our continued stewardship and conservation of the land; explore new foreign markets; and advance innovative research. The stakes are high. We need a comprehensive, bipartisan bill that will protect and bolster corn, America’s crop.” NCGA has been working diligently since the implementation of the last farm bill to thoughtfully develop recommendations for the 2023 farm bill by surveying membership, processing input from Action Teams and grower leaders, and analyzing the political environment.

    "title": "Dont Pick Winners and Losers When Establishing Emissions Standards, NCGA Tells EPA",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association submitted comments today to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency calling on the agency to focus on opening pathways for all low carbon fuels and technologies as it finalizes its proposed multi-pollutant emission standards for model year 2027 through 2032 for light and medium duty vehicles. “For automakers to use new technologies and enhanced engines to meet stringent standards, they need updated fuel that enables new vehicles and fuels to work as a system to enhance greenhouse gas and other tailpipe emissions reductions,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “Higher ethanol blends used with advanced engines optimized for higher octane would provide a much-needed pathway for low-carbon, low-emission fuels.” The EPA’s proposed multi-pollutant emissions standards has caused deep concerns for corn growers. The rule, as proposed, picks winners and losers in the energy sector and places ethanol on the losing side. NCGA launched a call-to-action on June 20 asking advocates to contact the EPA on its proposal and defend ethanol as a readily available, sustainable, clean fuel option for emissions reduction. Since that time, 2,109 people responded to NCGA’s campaign by submitting comments with EPA. Missouri Corn Growers Association submitted a letter to EPA with an additional 168 signatures. In its comments, NCGA highlights the environmental benefits of ethanol. “Clean octane from today’s ethanol is 50 percent lower in GHG emissions than gasoline and replaces the most harmful hydrocarbon aromatics to improve air quality and prevent adverse health impacts,” Haag noted in the comments. “EPA failed to use the proposal to broaden the solutions that reduce transportation emissions by beginning a transition to low carbon, high-octane fuels to advance climate, air quality and environmental justice goals with these and future standards. Furthermore, alternative fuel vehicles such as flex-fuel vehicles, which have the potential to reach zero emissions, should be equitably incentivized through these vehicle standards.” NCGA also reminded the EPA that a blueprint for future high-octane low-carbon fuels exists in the Next Generation Fuels Act and the agency has the statutory authority to make these changes without waiting for Congress to act.

    "title": "Biofuel, Farm, Fuel Marketer Groups Urge Fairness in Tailpipe Emissions Standards",
    "content": "America’s farmers, fuel marketers and retailers, and renewable fuel producers today called on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to adopt a market-oriented, technology-neutral approach to transportation decarbonization in its upcoming final tailpipe emissions standards for 2027-2032 light- and medium-duty vehicles. In a letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan, seven national associations representing the full spectrum of the renewable fuel supply chain, said the proposed rule favors electric vehicles while failing to consider the decarbonization potential of existing biofuels that can improve the emissions profile of the vast majority of cars on the road today. The organizations recommend that EPA account for all emissions relating to different fuel and engine technologies and equitably incentivize emissions reductions from all of those technologies. “EPA should use the best available science to accurately account for the full lifecycle carbon intensity associated with particular fuels and technologies, but its proposed approach ignores the significant upstream emissions from electricity generation associated with electric vehicles,” the groups said. “Incentives for alternative fuel technologies should be tied to those technologies’ full lifecycle environmental attributes rather than a single cherry-picked step in the lifecycle (i.e., tailpipe emissions).” The associations support the agency’s goal of reducing over-the-road transportation emissions but are concerned that the agency’s proposed standards “artificially tilts the scale towards electric vehicles” while ignoring other available fuel and vehicle options that can help decarbonize the transportation sector more rapidly and at a lower cost. The groups also noted that “the proposed rule exceeds the scope of the Agency’s statutory authority, which does not include authority to set greenhouse gas emission standards that effectively mandate EVs.” If finalized as proposed, EPA expects its tailpipe emissions standards could result in EVs accounting for 67% of new light-duty vehicle sales and 46% of new medium-duty vehicle sales by 2032. “The speed at which the Agency appears to anticipate the market and consumers will transition to electric vehicles is divorced from our members’ assessment of reality,” according to the letter. “The Proposed Rule does not appreciate the market obstacles associated with such a massive transition in consumer behavior. It also abandons proven decarbonization technologies, such as higher-octane liquid fuels, that can deliver material emissions reductions using existing infrastructure, existing vehicles, and working with consumers’ existing behavioral proclivities.” The organizations submitting the letter include the National Association of Convenience Stores; NATSO, Representing America’s Travel Plazas and Truckstops; National Corn Growers Association; National Farmers Union; Renewable Fuels Association; SIGMA: America’s Leading Fuel Marketers; and Growth Energy.

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) today applauded the U.S. Department of Agriculture for agreeing to invest $500 million from the Inflation Reduction Act to increase the availability of domestic biofuels and to give consumers cleaner fuel options. “We are appreciative of Secretary Vilsack and the Biden administration for continuing to recognize the many benefits of biofuels,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “Continued access to ethanol lowers fuel prices for drivers and increases our domestic fuel supply while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” USDA also announced today that in July it will begin accepting applications for $450 million in grants through the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program, which was created to support the infrastructure needed to lower out-of-pocket costs for transportation fueling. The program also allows distribution facilities to install and upgrade biofuel-related infrastructure, such as pumps, dispensers and storage tanks, according to USDA. “Increasing the availability of higher blends helps expand the retail infrastructure compatible with the future low-carbon, high octane, mid-level ethanol blends,” Haag said. “That’s why NCGA has invested in infrastructure for higher ethanol blends, partnering with ethanol associations to assist fuel retailers in applying for HBIIP grants.” There will be five application windows for HBIIP between July 1, 2023, and Sept. 30, 2024.

    "content": "Congress can ensure more consumer choice in fuels and vehicles by taking greater advantage of low-cost, low-emissions biofuels like ethanol, a leader of the National Corn Growers Association told members of Congress today. “As producers of the sustainable, primary feedstock for low carbon ethanol, corn farmers stand behind agriculture’s contribution to low-cost, cleaner, domestic energy,” NCGA CEO Neil Caskey said during testimony before the Subcommittee on Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Materials of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “Their production improvements will help achieve biofuels with net-zero emissions and higher ethanol blends cost less.” In his testimony, Caskey discussed several bills that that would leverage the benefits of biofuels to ensure a level playing field in transportation, including: The Fuels Parity Act, which ensures EPA uses the most accurate lifecycle emissions assessment for biofuels: the Department of Energy Argonne National Lab’s GREET model. The legislation recognizes progress made under the Renewable Fuel Standard, allowing all fuels, including corn ethanol, that meet the 50 percent lower GHG standard for an advanced biofuel to qualify as an advanced biofuel. The Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act, which would permanently remove outdated and unnecessary barriers to full market access to 15 percent ethanol-blended fuel, a lower-cost and lower emissions choice. Next Generation Fuels Act, which considers fuels and vehicles as a system, would improve our nation’s liquid fuel supply and transition new combustion vehicles to use advanced engines that take advantage of better fuels, such as higher blends of ethanol. This transition to updated fuels and vehicles would cut fuel costs, reduce GHG and other transportation emissions and increase fuel efficiency. Caskey said NCGA supports policies to further reduce emissions from vehicles but is opposed to EPA’s proposed approach for emission standards. “EPA’s proposed rule envisions only one solution to meet new standards, electric vehicles, without accounting for their full lifecycle emissions,” he said. “Rather than endorse a single technology, we are urging EPA to focus on outcomes and open pathways for all low-carbon fuels and technologies, as well as advance a needed rulemaking to improve fuels.” Read the full testimony.",

For 2023, EPA set an implied 15.25-billion-gallon requirement for conventional ethanol, which includes a supplemental 250 million gallons a prior court decision required EPA to restore to the RFS. For 2024 and 2025, EPA holds the implied conventional volume level at 15 billion gallons, despite proposing 15.25 billion gallons for those two years. “Today’s final RFS volumes came in below levels EPA proposed for conventional biofuels for 2024 and 2025, holding ethanol volumes steady at 15 billion gallons,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “A multi-year RFS volume rule offers stability and certainty for renewable fuels. However, when it comes to addressing pressing energy, environmental and economic challenges, EPA’s final rule falls short of the emission reductions and cost-saving benefits the higher proposed ethanol volumes would have provided.” Separate from the volumes, Haag noted corn growers appreciate that EPA did not finalize a proposal to create a new program to generate RFS credits from automakers for electricity from renewable biomass, referred to as e-RINS. “NCGA and its members strongly urged EPA to separate its e-RIN proposal from the RFS volumes because the proposal was wholly inconsistent with the way the RFS functions for other fuels and created an unlevel playing field across the RFS,” said Haag. The RFS requires annual volumes of renewable fuels, such as ethanol, be used in the fuel supply to reduce emissions, expand and diversify the supply, improve energy security and lower costs. The 2023-2025 volume is EPA’s first RFS rule based on qualitative environmental, economic and agricultural factors listed in the statute, rather than specific volumes in law. The new process allows EPA greater latitude, which the agency used to build on the strong baseline of the 2022 RFS volumes.",

    "title": "Advocacy Works: Corn Grower Leaders Reflect on Efforts Leading to Dispute Settlement Request",
    "content": "As the U.S. Trade Representative takes next steps on a dispute settlement request with Mexico over biotech corn, corn grower leaders across the country are reflecting on a months-long advocacy campaign that paid off for the nation’s farmers. “We began sounding the alarms about the ban last fall, because we knew the decree would have a devastating impact on U.S. corn growers and rural communities,” said National Corn Growers Association President Tom Haag. “We were working with members of Congress, engaging the media and meeting with the Biden administration. Thanks to these efforts, we were able to make a strong case that the U.S. government needed to intervene in this matter.” The concerns by U.S. farmers stem from a 2020 decree by Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador that sought to ban imports of biotech corn beginning in January 2024. Mexico issued a revised decree in February of this year that banned biotech corn for human consumption, effective immediately, and left the door open for a future ban on all biotech corn. NCGA President Tom Haag makes the case for government action during an interview on Fox Business. Since Mexico is a top market for corn and the number one agricultural export from the U.S., NCGA and state corn grower leaders have made this issue a top priority. As an example of their efforts, NCGA and state corn grower leaders: •Appeared in major media outlets, such as Reuters, Wall Street Journal, the Hill and on Fox News to make their case that action was needed. •Engaged corn grower allies in Congress to ensure they were speaking out on the issue with the Biden administration, in the press and in committee hearings. •Held a briefing for members of Congress and their staff to emphasize the impact to U.S. producers. •Ensured the concerns of state-based corn growers were heard by the Biden administration. The media have largely credited NCGA and state corn grower leaders for their advocacy efforts on advancing this issue. “After months of pressure last fall from the National Corn Growers Association and farm-state members of Congress, the Biden administration sent Mexico a formal, written request on Jan. 30 asking it to justify its proposed biotechnology measures,” a Politico reporter noted shortly after the announcement was made. Now that a dispute settlement request is underway, NCGA and state corn grower leaders will be working closely with USTR as it makes its next steps.",

    "title": "Corn Growers Praise Move by U.S. Trade Representative to Initiate Dispute Settlement with Mexico Over Corn Decree",
    "content": "The U.S. Trade Representative announced today that it is filing a dispute settlement under the U.S.- Mexico-Canada Agreement in response to the steps Mexico has taken to ban biotech corn for human consumption. The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), which along with affiliated state associations, has been leading calls for the Biden administration to act, praised the development. “Mexico’s actions, which are not based on sound science, have threatened the financial wellbeing of corn growers and our nation’s rural communities,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “We are deeply appreciative of Ambassador Katherine Tai and USTR for moving this process forward and thankful for the efforts of Secretary Tom Vilsack and members of Congress for standing up for farmers in such a meaningful way.” Under USMCA, once a dispute settlement is filed, a group of objective experts will be empaneled to hear the case and make final determinations based on the commitments both parties signed as part of the free trade agreement. The dispute stems from a 2020 decree by Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador that sought to ban imports of biotech corn beginning in January 2024. Mexico issued a revised decree in February of this year that banned biotech corn for human consumption effective immediately and left the door open for a future ban on biotech corn for feed. Mexico is a top market for corn, the number one agricultural export from the U.S., which has led to strong concerns over how the ban would impact U.S. farmers, rural economies and food security for the people of Mexico. Given the high stakes, NCGA and corn grower leaders across the country began sounding the alarm last fall and have been calling on the Biden administration to initiate a dispute settlement under USMCA.",

    "title": "As Summer Driving Season Begins, Consumers Continue to Save with Ethanol",
    "content": "As the summer driving season picks up, consumers will benefit from uninterrupted access to higher ethanol blends at the pump thanks to recent action by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Consumers would have lost the choice of lower-cost, higher blends of ethanol, referred to as E15 and often marketed as Unleaded 88, beginning today; however, EPA is using its authority to maintain consumer access. The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) has praised the development. “Continued access to higher ethanol blends as summer demand for travel rises not only lowers fuel prices for drivers and increases our domestic fuel supply, but also reduces emissions,” said National Corn Growers Association President Tom Haag. “We appreciate EPA and Administrator Regan for taking this commonsense action. We also appreciate the strong support from USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack and bipartisan members of Congress.” A comparison of pump prices from more than 550 retail stations during the past year shows drivers saved at least 25 cents per gallon with E15. In addition to being lower in carbon emissions, E15 has lower volatility than regular fuel, and using E15 results in lower evaporative and exhaust emissions, which is important during the summer driving season. Drivers looking for retailers offering E15 and other higher ethanol blends can use the Get Biofuel or E15/E85 Prices online tools to find stations near them or along their summer travel route. E15 is approved for all 2001 and newer vehicles, nearly all vehicles on the road today. To ensure drivers maintain full market access to the choice of E15, NCGA has called on EPA to finalize a plan developed by Midwest governors that would permanently extend access to E15.

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) welcomed interns to both offices thanks to the support by the Nebraska Corn Board (NCB) and the Nebraska Corn Growers Association (NeCGA). These internships provide students with an overview of the corn industry through real-world professional experiences while developing the next generation of talent to move the industry forward. Hannah Roebke is majoring in broadcasting, journalism and sports media and communication at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). She will be interning with NCGA in St. Louis, focusing on communications and outreach. Roebke says “I am excited for the opportunity to work in an industry that is close to my heart. I look forward to learning more about ag while getting to communicate the message of NCGA.” Alexis Bodlak, who is majoring in nutrition-community health and wellness, policy analysis and pre-law at UNL will be spending her summer in Washington, D.C. working on policy with NCGA. “Growing up as a third-generation farmer on a corn and soybean operation in Northeast Nebraska has shown me that it takes extreme dedication and perseverance to be a successful producer. I am excited to be interning for the National Corn Growers Association because they are just as dedicated and relentless in creating and advancing opportunities for corn growers all over the United States. This summer I am looking forward to assisting with the logistics of the annual Corn Congress, staying up to date on Farm Bill developments, and connecting with producers from various backgrounds,” Bodlak said. “Nebraska Corn has a reputation of excellence on the national stage, brought on by the students who participate and thrive in these internships,” said Kelly Brunkhorst, executive director of the Nebraska Corn Board and Nebraska Corn Growers Association. “Each year we are surprised by the strong candidates we are able to interact with, and this year was no exception. We look forward to hearing about their successful experiences.” Not only will students gain real-world experiences from these internship experiences but will also acquire valuable insight on possible future careers. Interns will document their learning experiences through written updates and social media posts.

    "title": "NCGA Applauds Supreme Court WOTUS Decision",
    "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court today handed a huge win to landowners, including farmers, in a case involving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s jurisdiction over Waters of the United States, often referred to as WOTUS. The National Corn Growers Association applauded the decision. “This sensible ruling preserves protections for our nation’s valuable water resources while providing clarity to farmers and others about the process of determining federal jurisdiction over wetlands,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “This is a great day for corn growers.” In the decision, the court narrowed the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction by clearly rejecting the vague \"significant nexus test,\" upending the Biden administration’s overreaching WOTUS rule. A 5-4 majority on the court issued an opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, that significantly narrowed the definition of adjacent wetlands, saying that to be adjacent and therefore a WOTUS, the wetland must have a continuous surface connection to a relatively permanent body of water connected to a traditional navigable water. The four-justice minority disagreed in an opinion, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, saying that a continuous surface connection test is too narrow, and overturns decades of precedent followed by both Republican and Democratic administrations. NCGA, which has long said that EPA’s broad definition of WOTUS creates pervasive uncertainty and confusion for the agricultural community and farmers trying to manage land they own and operate, has spoken out forcefully on the issue and joined other agricultural groups in filing an amicus brief as the Supreme Court considered the case. EPA is now expected to issue a revised WOTUS rule, since its current rule relies heavily on the significant nexus test.",

    "title": "$13.6 Million Grants Boost Technical Assistance for Farmers Adopting Cover Crops Through Farmers for Soil Health",
    "content": "Farmers adopting cover crops through Farmers for Soil Health can look forward to enhanced technical assistance. The recent $13.6 million grants from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation mark a significant step forward for farmers who plan to enroll in the program later this year. The grants, a key component of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s $95 million Partnership for Climate-Smart Commodities, will offer personal, on-the-ground technical support to farmers in 19 states. Farmers for Soil Health is a collaboration between the National Corn Growers Association, National Pork Board and United Soybean Board with the goal to advance conservation practices to improve soil health across the U.S., including doubling cover crop acres in the U.S. to 30 million acres by 2030. “U.S. farmers are dedicated to implementing sustainable practices that will not only feed and fuel a growing population but also protect our environment,” said Jack Cornell, director of sustainable supply for the United Soybean Board. “Adopting cover crops is one way farmers can continue to pursue best management practices. These grants provide technical assistance from crop advisors familiar with each state’s agronomic and production environment. The advisors will help farmers select cover crops that offer the most soil health benefits, minimize issues during planting and add value to their overall production efforts.” Regionally based technical assistance is important as farmers work toward economic and long-term success. The grants ensure that the technical assistance providers are trusted partners that have established relationships with farmers. \"We are excited to offer this opportunity to our state partners and affiliated organizations,” said Nathan Fields, National Corn Growers Association vice president of production and sustainability. “We recognize that the success of Farmers for Soil Health will be determined by these partners who work tirelessly on the front lines and have already earned the trust and support of their local farming communities. It’s a privilege to provide them with the resources they need to carry out this important work.” Grantees will also help farmers enroll in a digital platform facilitating the marketing of crops to end users interested in sustainably produced corn and soybeans.

    "title": "EP. 43 - The First Step is Giving a Darn: Mental Health on the Farm, with Jeff Ditzenberger and Dr. Josie Rudolphi",
    "content": "In honor of Mental Health Month, we talk with a former grower who uses his past struggles with suicide to help others today. The suicide rate among farmers is three and a half times higher than the general population. It’s a shocking statistic. We’re losing good people, but we don’t have to. From weather to markets, to prices, to the issues that come with a family business, farmers face a number of stressors that are unique to their occupation. And in rural America, suicide rates increased 46% from 2000-2020, compared to 27.3% in metro areas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So one of the National Corn Growers Association action teams is working with partners across the industry to spread the message that saying something could mean everything. In this episode, two of those partners share their stories and their expertise. Jeff Ditzenberger is a former grower from southern Wisconsin who uses his past struggles with suicide to help other people today. He travels around the country delivering his outspoken message that, “It’s okay to not be okay.” And Dr. Josie Rudolphi is an Associate Professor in the University of Illinois School of Agricultural and Biological Engineering with expertise in not only mental health, but its specific impacts in agricultural populations. If you or someone you know is struggling, please share one of these important resources we discuss in this episode: 988, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 1-800-447-1985, The Iowa Concern Hotline, a resource serving the agricultural community nationwide FarmStress.org, a central clearinghouse for mental health and financial resources for American farmers TugsGroup.com, Jeff Ditzenberger’s Wisconsin-based support group Direct Share Link: https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ncga?selected=PDM1704111546 Transcript: Jeff Ditzenberger: I will tell you, as someone who tried to take his own life, if somebody would've just asked me when I was giving them every sign that I possibly could if I was suicidal, if I wanted to talk, the course of my life would've gone in a completely different direction all the way around. We need to make it not taboo. Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to the Cobcast: Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway, we're making sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you're following this show in your favorite podcast app and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. I'm Dusty Weis. And in this episode, since May is Mental Health Month, we're making space for an important discussion that really matters for farmers and those who care for them, because the suicide rate among farmers is 3 and a half times higher than the general population. From 2000-2020, suicide rates increased 46% in rural areas compared to 27.3% in metro areas according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We're losing good people, and we don't have to. From weather, to the markets, to prices, to the issues that come with a family business, farmers face many unique stressors every day. So one of the National Corn Growers' action teams is working with partners across the industry right now to spread the message that saying something could mean everything. Joining us today are two unique and important perspectives working on this issue. And the first is Jeff Ditzenberger, a grower from southern Wisconsin. Jeff, thank you for joining us on the Cobcast. Jeff Ditzenberger: Thanks, Dusty, for having me. Appreciate what you're doing. I'm not actually a grower anymore, I work for an online auction company and have the entire state of Wisconsin now, that's my responsibility. So trust me, there's still a lot of corncob and soybean conversations that are happening out there and a lot of conversations with people that are struggling with the things they can't control, like weather and prices and inputs and that kind of stuff. Dusty Weis: I'm always glad to be able to welcome another Wisconsinite onto the show here, Jeff. That's the heart of cheese, corn, and soybean country out there, and we know that you're going to bring some great expertise to the table here. But Jeff, one of the reasons that we wanted to talk to you today is because I understand that you have a personal story that ties in with the topic at hand here. Jeff Ditzenberger: Yeah, actually I do. So back in the early nineties, it was not real cool for guys to talk about their emotional state. I'm a veteran, I was over in Iraq. The ship that I was on carried a lot of ammunition and oil and fuel, so a big floating time bomb, and so kind of a lot of stress there. Got married young. I mean, I went in the military at 17 and a half right after I graduated. When I got out of the service, I was really having a lot of PTSD. And you just... Back in '91, '92, in that era, you just didn't talk about mental health at all, and especially amongst guys. I can remember asking some of my guy friends, \"I'm having a rough day. I'd kind of like to just have a chitchat with ya.\" It was the, \"Suck it up buttercup or pull up your bootstraps or men don't cry.\" That whole gamut of things that follows that. And late '91, early '92, I tried to take my own life. I actually put myself in an old abandoned house and lit it on fire and failed miserably, thankfully, but back then when they asked me about it, I was less embarrassed to be a veteran and a volunteer firefighter with a felony on my record, than I was to admit that I'd actually tried to end my life and kept it a secret for a long, long time, Dusty. Dusty Weis: Well, and it's something that you've incorporated into your day-to-day now is since you had that experience, it seems like you've really made helping other people cope with their mental health a part of your life going forward. Even down to your email signature. I noticed when we were corresponding running up to this that you end every email with a little quote, \"It's okay to not be okay.\" Is it safe to say that this experience changed your life and refocused you on things outside of your own experience in helping other people, yeah? Jeff Ditzenberger: It did. So in 2014, the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation asked me to write a blog. I was currently Green County Farm Bureau president at the time, and I wrote about men, farmers, and mental health. And at the time I was married to Marie, and she had watched her first husband die by suicide in front of her. And to hear that a 22-year-old lady had to take her husband off of life support, that was one of the first turning point triggers with me, and then I just got tired of burying my own friends. Let's be honest, some of the top risk groups are veterans, farmers, and men. And Farm Bureau was like, \"Absolutely not. We are not printing this.\" And it was the first time that I had actually admitted that I had tried to end my life. And I said to them, I'm like, \"If you're not going to print this, then I don't know that I want to be a member of your association anymore.\" And they're like, \"Well, we'll do it, but the ramifications are on you.\" And so I did it and the response was kind of overwhelming, to be quite honest. And shortly after that, Casey Langen had gotten ahold of me, and Casey Langen at that time was the director of communications within Farm Bureau, and he says, \"Hey Ditz, my wife wants to talk to you.\" And at that time then they asked me to be the keynote speaker at Madison Dane County Safe Communities guys night out. Now I'll tell you what, when I first heard guys night out, I was like, pizza, beer, we talk about football. But on the way up there, I took my uncle who had mental challenges as well, and his own suicide attempt, but became one of my best friends and then my best friend Scott. And then my uncle took one of his friends. And on the way up there, I wasn't feeling the best. And I thought, \"Well, maybe I'm kind of hungry.\" And I was reading my speech and I hate writing speeches. And so we stopped at McDonald's, bad idea if you're not feeling well already, and ripped up my speech and threw it away. And my buddy Scott was like, \"Isn't that your speech?\" He's like, \"What are you going to talk about?\" And I says, \"I don't really know, but that's not it.\" And walked into the venue and it was fairly full When they introduced me, they did a little bit about my military career, and that's when it kind of hit me. The ship that I was on, as I told you guys earlier here already, was the second largest displacement ship in the US Navy next to an aircraft carrier. So think Camp Randall is about the size of it. And in order to get into port, we would have to call it tugboat. And that tugboat would come out and you can't hear him and you can't really see him. Might see a little smoke and a little chukchuk. You don't see the physical, because it's just a little fella. And when I was down below deck and when we were going into port, everything would go super quiet and you just get this sense of calm about you, and then you'd feel this little bump and you knew you were moving, but it was magical, Dusty. You're like, \"How are we doing this?\" And once we got into port, then you'd hear this magical voice come across the speaker that basically said, \"You're safe at home. If you don't have to work, go see your loved ones.\" And I thought to myself, I'm like, why can't life be like that? If you're a big ship in troubled waters, why couldn't you call it tugboat to come help you out? And on the way home, then I said to my buddy Scott, I'm like, \"Dude, I want to start a non-profit.\" And basically stayed awake that night, super excited and came up with the acronym TUGS, talking, understanding, growing and supporting, because even big ships need little ships sometimes. And the core ideology behind my group is to get rid of a lot of the stigmas, to let guys know that it's okay to cry in front of their guy friends, to let veterans know that, \"Hey, you defended this country and now we're here for you.\" To let farmers know that, \"Hey, we understand that you're isolated and that you have a lot of situations that you can't control, but we get it.\" And especially in the agricultural community and farmers specifically, there's a whole different language that they speak. So that's what I've been very careful about is to make sure that I've got members of my board that know how to talk to farmers, know how to talk to veterans, everybody's kind of got their own little niche that they do. And people will ask me, \"What's your ultimate goal?\" And I'm like, I would love to have the day where we could look in the dictionary and the word suicide wouldn't be in there, would be in the history books. The other biggest thing that I want to see, and we need to do more of it now as it's going along, is we need to just have those conversations. We need to have those tough conversations and ask people how they're doing and bring them out of their struggles and bring them out of that darkness, and I always tell everybody which conversation is harder? The conversation of asking somebody if they're struggling and suicidal, or the conversation with their loved ones when you're at their funeral after they make a permanent decision to a temporary problem? And I usually get the same answer all the time. So that's the nuts and bolts of it, Dusty. Dusty Weis: Jeff, it's really heartening to me that you're in a position now where you're able to share this story, because there might be somebody listening right now who's dealing with similar struggles and certainly could take away some lessons or even maybe even a little bit of hope, just from hearing that you've been there. And so when you talk about the stigma about talking about mental health, and it sounds like it was part of your experience when you were going through your struggles as well, that you were looking for people to talk to, but you just couldn't find anybody who was willing to push through that stigma. And so our other guest today, I want to talk to about just how common that problem is in the farm community, in rural communities. Dr. Josie Rudolphi is an assistant professor at the University of Illinois School of Agriculture and Biological Engineering with expertise not only in mental health, but its specific impacts, especially on safety and overall health and in agricultural population. So Dr. Rudolphi, thank you for joining us as well today. Dr. Josie Rudolphi: Thank you so much for having me and making this a priority for the podcast. We really appreciate it. Dusty Weis: So first of all, as you listen to Jeff's story there is what you're hearing that sort of reluctance among one's peers, one's friends, to talk about mental health issues, is that something that is still common in farm and rural culture, and how has that been changing, would you say? Dr. Josie Rudolphi: Yeah, I really appreciate Jeff's story and his willingness to share. I think hearing what happens and what happened to people is really important if we do want to move the needle and think about how we're going to make real change. And we have statistics, we can tell you what we see as terms of anxiety and depression in the population, but there's not a story behind that. And unfortunately that's just a number and not a person. So Jeff, thank you so much for being willing to share your story. And unfortunately, we still see stigma as something that's really precluding a lot of these conversations from being had, people are still somewhat reluctant, I should say, to disclose what they might be going through, especially among older populations and older farmers. I think we're starting to see the tide change a little bit. We're starting to see younger farmers be much more willing to have these conversations. I feel hopeful in podcasts like this, and when farm bureaus and other commodity groups and ag organizations invite people like Jeff, people like me, to have a presence and a space at their national conferences and state conferences, it really, I think, suggests that they acknowledge what a lot of our farmers are going through and realize that if we continue to build a wall around farm stress and mental health, we're going to continue to lose farmers. And so I'm hopeful, I guess, and that the stigma is starting to change. This average age of a farmer is still 58, a majority of farmers are male. These things don't help the stigma situation. And we live in more conservative communities, smaller communities, rural communities, all of which are really good at hiding and encouraging people maybe not to speak out or let them know how they're doing. Dusty Weis: So certainly loneliness and feeling like you don't have an outlet, don't have somebody to talk to about these issues. These are contributing factors, stressors if you will. But agriculture is a profession unlike any other, and so the stressors that affect farmers are also unique to our industry in a lot of ways. And they can be really complex and really personal. How do we see the profession and the culture around the farm contributing to this mental health epidemic, beyond just the stigma? Dr. Josie Rudolphi: Absolutely. So we have data to suggest that a number of the unique agricultural stressors are associated with both anxiety and depression, and we see anxiety and depression in the ag population at prevalences that far exceed that of the general population. I did a survey of young farmers, 60% met the criteria for at least mild depression and mild anxiety. And we see similar estimates or statistics when we consider more experienced farmers. And the stressors that we see most associated with anxiety and depression are things like personal finances. Farmers live in a world where we don't get to set the price for our product, and we're also not guaranteed a paycheck. A lot of people enjoy a paycheck every month, every two weeks. It's something you can count on and it's reliable, and farmers we know don't experience that. We see stressors around the weather. It's spring. We see a lot of people who are either planting or want to be planting, and we're refreshing the weather app constantly. Very few other occupations are so dependent on the weather. Very few other occupations are so concerned about soil temperatures. So there's a lot of these things that are totally out of control of the farmer, which make it a really challenging type of stress to manage. When we think about maybe stress that is more manageable, but still unique to agriculture, we talk a lot about the family farm and we have really romanticized the family farm as this idyllic place to be, but we know that there is a lot of stress in family farm operations, and as beautiful as maybe three generations working together might look, we know that there are people in that system who don't appreciate a lot of support, or report more stress than say other generations. And so these are the sorts of things that are more manageable but still contribute, we know, to anxiety and depression. Dusty Weis: And not to mention sometimes there's just the completely out of left field wacky stuff that completely disrupts your farming operation. We can look back at 2012, and the huge nationwide drought that we suffered then, or some of the recent disruptive derecho storms that have swept through entire swaths of farm country and flattened entire corn crops. Besides just these disruptive things, have you noticed any trends in the amount of stress that's being felt on the farm recently? Dr. Josie Rudolphi: So that's a really good question, and we think we know that agriculture's very cyclical. So there's periods of peak activity, especially in the Midwest where we're crop focused, planting and harvest we have a ton of activity, summers and winters less activity. So we expect to see the cyclical nature of agriculture to stress and mental health. We don't have that good data yet, we haven't done longitudinal studies yet to be able to say with any certainty that that's what somebody experiences, but we also know that we may not expect a lot of stress in February in the Midwest, but then something happens worldwide and it totally disrupts everything we once knew. I was at the commodity classic early March of 2022- Dusty Weis: Right after the Russian evasion of Ukraine. Dr. Josie Rudolphi: Right. Absolutely. So here we're going in, a lot of us are mostly thinking about planting. We're going to see how much we can learn at Commodity Classic, and the entire conversation was around Russia and Ukraine and every- Dusty Weis: And inputs. How are we going to get our inputs, how we going to get our fertilizer? Dr. Josie Rudolphi: Absolutely. And every economist there said, \"My slides are already out of date. We're living in these unprecedented times.\" And so that just speaks to there is almost no period of normal anymore, and we are just constantly trying to respond to today's stress and it just creates an incredibly unhealthy environment for us physically and mentally. Dusty Weis: Jeff, as you listen to Dr. Rudolphi, do any of these stressors, any of these situations that we've discussed so far here jump out at you as things that you yourself have seen or experienced and grappled with on the farm? Jeff Ditzenberger: Well, you talk about, and I love the way you said it, that we've romanticized the family farm. 95% of the farms are family owned, but not what we traditionally think of as family farm either. And I appreciate your comment, because that's very important to make sure that that's understood, that you got three generations there. From the aspect of that fourth or fifth generation that all of a sudden they've had a whole bunch of things that have happened. They've had storm come through, they've had some kind of a disease come through that wipes out their animals, or wipes out their crops. It's nothing of their faults, but now they're having to get out of the business and they feel like that epic failure because of it. There's so many layers to this, and honestly, I think Dr. Josie and I could sit here for hours and hours and hours and go over the things that are happening out there, but any of us that have been in agriculture for any amount of time, especially on the production side of it, this is a lifestyle and it's a pride lifestyle. We're very proud of what we do, but let's be honest, pride doesn't pay the bills. And I've said it many, many a time and I kind of feel a little bad saying it in a way, but it's something that I think everybody has to hear that truly the only thing we can control in this industry is our attitudes. We've got to take a step back when we're struggling with the crop doesn't look good because we're not getting any rain. We don't have any control over that. You spent four hours working on a mama cow to try to save her and the calf and you don't save either one of them. The emotional roller coaster that farmers go through, and I've spoke in front of groups that are an average age of 75, one of the most amazing ones that I got to do was at the University of Wisconsin Platteville, and the day of the presentation, they had 22 RSVPs, they had that few of RSVPs, and they called me and they said, \"Hey, we've only got these 23, 24 RSVPs and most of them are staff.\" I'm like, \"I don't care. This is a message that has to get out, whether it matches one person or 200 people or 2000 people, I don't care. If we can make a difference with one person, I'm good with that.\" So a beautiful day and 80 degrees, Platteville's football field was covered with people in the band and playing football catch and that kind of stuff. And when I got in there, we had a group of about 20 more join the original 20, and then we had another group of about 50 come in, but we ended up having to switch rooms three times and there was over 200 people in that auditorium of all ages. And the response afterwards, the number of those kids that were like, \"I need to go home and talk to my brother, I think this is what he's going through.\" Or, \"I need to go home and talk to my dad. I think this is what he's going through.\" And on the flip side of that, when I've done stuff that like Wisconsin, Corn, Soy and those kind of conventions, the number of 75 year old men that'll come up to me in tears and say, \"I wish my son could have heard this before he took his life.\" You know, Josie you make such a good point. This is something that we can change the needle on this. And I think we've changed it some. But the simplest thing is to have that conversation and a struggle in our industry because like I said earlier, it's a special language. I had some farm bankruptcy attorneys and we were going through all those bankruptcies back, what was that, '18 or '19? I had psychiatrists and psychologists that were calling me and I had farm bankruptcy attorneys that were calling me and they're like, \"We need to know how to talk to these people. I don't understand this whole return on investment and hundred weights of milk and bushels for acre and all this other stuff.\" If you can't relate on that aspect, that's not going to help you. But the other thing that we have gotten away from in my opinion, is just that ability to be nice to people, to be kind to people, to ask people how they're doing and be willing to have those tough conversations. Some of them that I've had over the years, Dusty, I've heard guns click on the end of the phone line. I've been sent pictures with people holding a handful of pills. Some of the conversations that I've had at 2:00, 2:30 in the morning will just tear your heart out. And it's something that doesn't have to happen. I mean, we need to get that connect back to where we're letting people know, and it's why it's on every signature, on every single email account that I have, it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to have bad days. It's okay to feel bad. We need to validate that at the same time when people are telling us that. Dusty Weis: There are conversations that need to happen. And when you tell me about that thing at the University of Wisconsin Platteville, where you got 200 people in a room, it tells me that there's an appetite out there to have that conversation. It's just that people don't know where to go for it, and they're afraid that they're going to be mocked, that they're going to told to, to use your words, Jeff, buck up buttercup, when they try to have that conversation with people. So how do we create intentionally a space for people to have those feelings and have those conversations with the people who they know and love and care about, without coming off as heavy-handed, preachy? I don't know. These are all adjectives, I'm sure that you've heard before. Jeff Ditzenberger: There's a misconception out there that if you talk to somebody who's suicidal and you ask them directly if they're suicidal, that that's going to make them more suicidal. And I will tell you, as someone who tried to take his own life, if somebody would've just asked me when I was giving them every sign that I possibly could, if I was suicidal, if I wanted to talk, we wouldn't be having this conversation. The course of my life would've gone in a completely different direction all the way around, we need to make it not taboo. We talk about COVID, we talk about all these other things that happened, but we still don't seem to want to really have that open candid conversation about mental health. And you don't have to have any fancy letters behind the back of your name. You can be just a normal everyday person and just be like, \"Hey, are you okay?\" And be willing to sit down and talk to that person if they're not, and validate that. This thing of, Josie and I, we see each other in the office and I say to Josie, \"What's going on Josie?\" And she's like, \"Oh, my dog died and I'm really sad.\" \"Well, bill lost his wife last night. He's got it worse than you do.\" Stop that stuff. Why can't we just say, \"Hey, Josie, I'm really sorry. I remember when I lost my dog was sick and whatnot. That was terrible. Is there anything I can do for you?\" Sometimes people just want you to listen for five minutes. Sometimes they might want a little bit of advice back or whatever, but why is it so wrong for us to not validate people's bad days or people's emotions that are messing with them, and just say, \"Hey, I'm here. I'm going to create a space for you right now.\" Dusty Weis: Jeff, just to kind of add onto that, and I grew up around farm culture too, and one thing that always really impressed me about my grandfather who ran a tree farm in Northern Wisconsin, my other grandfather who grew up in dairy and Central Wisconsin, that they were tough guys. There was nothing that they were afraid of. There was nothing that they couldn't do if they put their mind to it. And I wonder sometimes if there's not a way to take that attitude and turn it toward mental health, because if toughness is something that we value in farm country and it is, why not do the toughest thing that there is and have a conversation that's uncomfortable with somebody who needs to hear from you? Jeff Ditzenberger: I think it takes more guts to admit that you're struggling. Anybody can tell you that you're having a good day. Anybody can tell you that everything's just freaking peachy, it takes a lot of guts to come out and say, \"Hey, I'm having a rough day.\" How many of us on this call have heard the words, \"Quit crying or I'll give you something to cry about.\" Dusty Weis: Yeah, right there. Yeah. Jeff Ditzenberger: Stop. Emotions are there, whether we like it or not. I mean, God gave them to us. If you're struggling for that day that everything is kind of overwhelming you or whatever, speak out about it. And for those of us that are being spoken to, create that space. We talk about creating safe spaces, and I know some people make fun of it. I think it's great. I think it's the greatest thing ever. I can remember when I was in the detective's office and they told me that they were pretty sure that I had lit that fire and that they were going to charge me with arson, I had two choices, I could either go to jail, I could go to the mental institution, and I went to the mental institution. I haven't made a lot of really, really, really, really, really good decisions. That was a really, really, really, really good decision. I got in there where I didn't get judged, where people were like-minded, where the doctors and nurses were like, \"We get it. We understand you're going through some stuff.\" They didn't call me crazy, they didn't call me weird. They didn't call me any of those things. And it's a conversation that was created there. Well, you know what? We can do that conversation on the outside before we lose any more people. Dusty Weis: Right. Yeah. Dr. Rudolphi, please go ahead. Dr. Josie Rudolphi: I really connected with Jeff's comment about the toughest thing we can do is reach out and ask for help. And I hate to lean into that tough guy language, but I really do think it's true. And one thing we try to communicate with farmers is that you would not let a pest infest your field to the point where you had no yield. You would enlist the help of a professional, you would bring in a veterinarian, you would talk to your agronomist. You would do something about that. In that same way, why don't we get you help? If you need it, there are resources out there, you deserve it. And I think there's a lot of people who don't feel like they deserve to feel good sometimes. And I think to Jeff's other point about the toxic positivity that we often bring into conversations if we're trying to offer support, it's easy for us to say, if someone says they're having a bad day, \"You don't have it nearly as bad as some other people. Someone else has it a lot worse than you do.\" I think some of us offer that sort of response as a way to try to make Jeff, for example, feel better. And then we feel like, oh, we've helped. And the reality is that you don't have to help. A lot of times somebody just needs someone to listen. Don't expect resolution right away. You're not going to snap somebody out of their depressive episode. You're not going to bring somebody out of anxiety. But you can show that you're there to be supportive. And then I start a lot of conversations by mentioning why I'm concerned about somebody. So coming from a place of love and saying, \"I'm really worried about you because X, Y, and Z.\" We can really normalize a situation by using language like, \"Hey, it's been a really crappy spring.\" Acknowledging that it's been bad for everybody. \"How are you holding up?\" Or, \"Man, it won't dry up. Are we ever going to get in the field? How are you managing?\" And what that does is it really gives people a space. You've sort of laid out the carpet for somebody to really complain for a while. You've said, \"I'm inviting you into this space. We've had a tough time.\" And people might balk at you and people say, \"Oh, so what? You're a therapist now?\" I say, \"No, I'm just a friend, but I'm here to talk to you and let you know that you are not alone.\" And I think that's really the most important message that you are absolutely not alone. Dusty Weis: Now, Dr. Rudolphi, we've all been around someone who's struggling before, and so certainly saying something is the first step there, but what do you do if they don't want to talk about it? What do you do if they make it uncomfortable, or they tell you to go away? Is it something that you should bring up again? Is there outside intervention that you should seek? What do you do there? Dr. Josie Rudolphi: Some people are not going to be comfortable talking to everybody. There's a couple of things you can do. So there's a lot of really great farm specific telephone helplines and hotlines and websites for resources. And so what I might do is if somebody's really uninterested in engaging with me, I might say, \"You know what? I acknowledge that maybe you don't want to talk to me about this, but let me offer you a couple of resources.\" I'll text them the Iowa Concern hotline or what's been rebranded as the Concern Hotline, or I'll send them some resources that I think might be helpful. And it's a really passive way of trying to offer some resources and hopefully some support. Another thing you can do is if, in family structures, especially I have siblings, I can tell they're stressed. They may not be super interested in talking to me, but I know they're having a bad day. So what I might do is I might call the spouse and say, \"Hey, when he gets home, will you just talk to him a little bit. Something's really bothering him, but he didn't really want to open up to me.\" So we can engage other people in the family or in their unit, somebody they might be more comfortable with. And we can see this in small communities where we have church leaders or clergy or other types of people in the community that somebody might really connect with. Dusty Weis: Can you tell us what some of those resources are that you can really just send someone toward like a website, a phone number, something like that? We'll also put a link to all of these, and put them in the episode description as well, so if anybody wants to click in there, copy and paste them, anything like that? Dr. Josie Rudolphi: Absolutely. So in the North Central region, which is kind of the 12 states in the Midwest, we have a website, it's farmstress.org, and it's about 110 farm and ranch specific resources that we've amassed from the 12 states that are in this region. They're state specific websites with what states would consider to be their sort of cream of the crop resources and services. And then there's a clearinghouse space there of, like I said, over 110 different resources for various audiences. So we have some for farm families, for farmers, ranchers, farm workers, and even farm youth. Oh, hotline that I really like and I really recommend is the Iowa Concern Hotline. It was established in the mid-eighties in response to the farm crisis. It is staffed 24/7. It will respond to calls from anybody. It's actually just recently been rebranded from the Iowa Concern Hotline to the Concern Hotline, because a telephone knows no state boundary. And so that number is 1800 447 1985. It's staffed by people who know agriculture. So like Jeff mentioned, it's really important we've learned that farmers have an opportunity to talk to people who understand agriculture. So this line is staffed by professionals who can talk you through not only stress and crisis type issues, but also answer legal questions and financial questions, and then also connect you to local resources, like in the event of a natural disaster. So we really like that hotline. It's been around for a very long time. Answers thousands of calls a year and has really stood the test of time. Jeff Ditzenberger: Real quick, I want to add onto Dr. Josie's list of resources is the new National Suicide Hotline, which is simply 988, and you can call or text that. Now, I know they're not necessarily farmer specific all the time, but it's a great resource. We talk about stigmas. None of these resources that you call are going to send people out to your farm and drag you into town and put you into a hospital, or anything like that too. And I think we need to clarify that, because there's been many a times that I've been having a conversation and I'm like, \"Hey, you know what? I'm going to call the National Suicide Hotline while I'm standing here with you, and I will stay in your space with you.\" And, \"Oh, no, no, no, I don't want those people coming here.\" They're not going to do that. So please remember that one's out there too. And one that we have locally that's now nationwide for the kids is the Got Your Back app, which is available on Apple and Android, both. You can get a squad together and you can do that kind of stuff. Dusty Weis: Awesome. And we will again put links to that in the episode description here. But I wanted to end on this note, Jeff, certainly as someone who has struggled with this for a long time and has taken a very active role in helping other people with their struggles, you've seen the way that attitudes have shifted over the years, but you even mentioned that 10 years ago you tried to write a blog post about this and we're told, \"You sure you want to do that.\" And now we're sitting here, we're having an open discussion about it on the National Corn Growers Association podcast. Feels like there's a change in the air about how the farm community faces mental health issues. What would you say, Jeff, is driving that change? Jeff Ditzenberger: I think part of the shift is we're having these conversations on a broader scale, and I was involved in a full length documentary that is now hitting all the film festivals, that has been picked up by PBS for next year. And it's interesting after going to the screenings to see the general public start asking questions. And I think you've got guys like myself, you've got guys like Jason Meadows, who's got a great podcast out there, what you guys are doing from an agricultural podcast standpoint, I think when we can put real faces to this and have those conversations, that's what's going to give us the shift, Dusty. Like what Dr. Josie said, too, create that space. Or if you can't talk to the person who's struggling, get their core group to help them out. And if you don't think that words have value, you're just going to really quick tell my cat guy story for us in the Midwest. You know, walk into your local QuikTrip or your local Casey's or whatever, you're like, \"Hey, how's it going?\" [inaudible 00:31:00] and everybody, what's their common answer, \"Doing good.\" Or, \"Living the dream.\" Or whatever. And I did this one morning and this gentleman said to me, he goes, \"What do you care?\" And I said, \"Well, I asked you.\" And he says, \"Yeah, but what do you care?\" And I said, \"Well, I do.\" I said, \"Now, I'm really curious, is everything all right?\" and he says, \"Well, if you really want to know,\" he says, \"I think my cat's dying.\" And I go, \"Why do you think your cat's dying?\" And he goes, \"Well, I feed her and I water, and she makes this really disgusting sound.\" And I says, \"Sounds to me like your cat's got a hairball.\" And he goes, \"What? Are you a veterinarian?\" And I'm like, \"No, but I've had a lot of cats.\" And he goes, \"What do I do?\" And I says, \"Go to Walmart or Walgreens or wherever. Get yourself some hairball remedy. Give it to your cat. It's going to be disgusting. I'm just going to warn you now the [inaudible 00:31:39] she's doing right now is nothing compared to what it's going to be with this. But if she doesn't get better, take her to the veterinarian.\" Parted ways. Six weeks later, I'm back in QuikTrip again, just about ready to pay for my breakfast. This hand slams down next to me and says, \"I'm paying for this man's breakfast.\" And I turned around and here it's cat guy, still don't know his name to this day. And he says, \"Do you remember me?\" And I says, \"Yeah.\" I said, \"You're the guy with the cat.\" And he goes, \"We need to talk outside.\" And I was like, oh, I hope they have cameras out there, because this doesn't sound like it's going to end well. Anyways, we get outside and he goes, \"You were right. He says, I gave it that hairball medicine. It was fine. Everything's good. You were also right. It was really disgusting.\" I go, \"Yeah, I know.\" I said, \"Well, I'm glad to hear everything turned out right.\" I said, \"Have a good day.\" And he goes, \"No.\" He says, \"What I need to let you know.\" He says, \"I had just moved here from the east-coast and I had nobody here except for me and my cat.\" And he goes, \"When I moved here, I moved here for a job that the first day I showed up for work, they hadn't told me they weren't going to need me anymore.\" And he says, \"I told myself that morning when I walked out of my apartment that if my cat died, I was going to die with my cat.\" And I tell you what, folks, if you don't think I don't think about that every single morning when I wake up, and one of the first things I say to myself every single morning when I look in the mirror is, \"What are your chances of running into a cat guy today?\" We have such a responsibility to not only the farmers and ranchers and corn growers and soybean growers and everybody else out there that's feeding the nation, but we have a responsibility to our fellow man, our fellow woman, our fellow children, to ask them if they're okay, to tell them that it's okay to not be okay. And I will end my part of this the way that I end all my speeches. We live in a world where we can be anything we want, the most important thing to be is kind. Dusty Weis: Jeff, it's a remarkable story. And what's most incredible to me about it is all you did was give a darn. It's not like you gave the guy 20 bucks. It's not like you drove him to the veterinarians. All you did was listen to him and you saved his life. So thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Dr. Rudolphi, for the work that you do to lead on this issue for your courage, your compassion that you show in speaking out. I'd like to close just by urging farm families, industry partners, anybody who cares for a farmer to just help look for the science, to just give a darn. It could seem intimidating, it could seem scary, but it is vital because saying something can truly mean everything. And thank you for listening.

    "title": "Updates to Mississippi River Infrastructure, Key to Corn Growers, Begin North of St. Louis",
    "content": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers held a groundbreaking ceremony today marking the beginning of repairs to a lock and dam on the Upper Mississippi River that is crucial to the shipment of corn and other commodities. Lock and Dam 25, which is almost 50 miles North of St. Louis, has not been extensively repaired since it was constructed in the early part of the 20th century, but thanks to decades of advocacy, funding for the project was included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act when it passed in 2021. Now, thanks to that federal funding, updates to the structure have begun. The Illinois Corn Growers Association, which has been at the forefront of advocating for updates to Lock and Dam 25, praised the development. “The Illinois Corn Growers Association and the diverse partners brought together by Waterways Council Inc. have worked tirelessly to update our inland waterways infrastructure for nearly three decades,” said ICGA President Matt Rush. “Our hope is this will be the beginning of a waterfall of infrastructure work on the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers.” Lock and Dam 25 is crucially important to corn growers as 60 percent of America’s corn and soybean exports are transported on the Mississippi River. The river is also important in shipping products to key markets in the U.S. and abroad. When barges are delayed because of problems with aging locks and dams, farmers are economically affected.",

    "title": "Kansas Corns Roe to House Oversight Subcommittee: Include Biofuels as Climate Solution",
    "content": "Testifying at a House Oversight Subcommittee hearing on vehicle emissions rules and electric vehicle transition, Kansas Corn Growers Association CEO Josh Roe said biofuels like ethanol should not be ignored as a climate solution. Roe told the subcommittee the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed standards for new vehicles limit greater use of low carbon liquid fuels like ethanol to help reach climate goals. EPA’s focus on electric vehicles ignores a solution that is available to nearly every vehicle on the road today. “The agricultural and liquid fuels industries stand ready to assist in reducing air pollution. Unfortunately, current, and proposed EPA rules prevent us from being part of the solution and adversely impact low income and rural citizens across the United States,” Roe stated. “While we believe electric vehicles will play a vital role in achieving these goals, other complementary alternatives, such as biofuels, have a key role to play but are being pushed aside.” High-octane low-carbon fuel containing higher ethanol blends is a low cost, high-impact climate solution that can be used in the nation’s existing vehicles and new vehicles. “High-octane low-carbon fuels containing higher biofuel content reduce emissions, both because they’re less carbon intensive to produce, and because higher octane means significant gains in fuel economy. HOLC fuels offer a solution to air quality problems, combat inflation, do not require a publicly funded overhaul of our transportation infrastructure or require consumers to purchase vehicles that may not be compatible with their way of life,\" Roe said. Roe questioned EPA’s proposal that considers electric vehicles as zero-emission. “EVs are not truly zero-emission vehicles. While they do not have a tailpipe, you still need to account for the emissions that come from the power grid. The U.S. power grid is currently 60% powered by coal and natural gas,” Roe said. “Current and proposed EPA rules do not account for these upstream emissions when calculating compliance, let alone the additional emissions and toxic pollution generated by mining rare earth minerals around the world.” See Roe’s full testimony here: https://kscorn.com/2023/05/17/roe-testifies/",

    "title": "NCGA Supports New Legislation that Would Level the Playing Field for Ethanol",
    "content": "Legislation was introduced today in the U.S. House of Representatives that would remove an outdated provision from the Renewable Fuels Standard that prevents corn ethanol from being categorized as an advanced biofuel. The legislation recognizes the progress made in cutting the carbon intensity of ethanol since the RFS was enacted. The bill, introduced by Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa) and original cosponsors Reps. Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.), Eric Sorensen (D-Ill), Wesley Hunt (R-Texas) and Stephanie Bice (R-Okla.), would also require that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency use the more modern and accurate Argonne GREET model to assess the carbon reductions from biofuels under the RFS. The National Corn Growers Association supports the legislation. “We applaud Rep. Miller-Meeks and the original cosponsors for introducing legislation that recognizes the declining carbon intensity of today’s low-carbon ethanol and helps level the playing field,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “Farmers are proud to contribute to lowering ethanol’s carbon footprint through our production practices, and this bill would ensure EPA uses the most recent science and data to accurately measure the greenhouse gas reduction benefits of biofuels.” Published analysis from the Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory concludes corn ethanol’s carbon intensity decreased 23 percent from 2005 to 2019 due to increased corn yield, reduced fertilizer intensity and improved ethanol production efficiency, with corn ethanol now between 44 and 52 percent lower in carbon intensity than the gasoline it replaces. Argonne’s analysis is consistent with recent research from Environmental Health and Engineering, with contributors from Harvard and Tufts Universities, that corn ethanol today is 46 percent lower in carbon intensity than gasoline, with the potential for further reductions from additional corn feedstock and production process improvements. Begun in 2005 and expanded in 2007, the RFS requires transportation fuel sold in the United States contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. Under the law, advanced biofuels must deliver a 50 percent or more reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline, a requirement today’s ethanol is capable of meeting.",

    "title": "NCGA to EPA: Biofuels Should be Used to Lower Auto Greenhouse Gas Emissions",
    "content": "A leader with the National Corn Growers Association today expressed serious concerns to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials regarding the limitations of the agency’s proposed vehicle emissions standards and highlighted how the agency could take greater advantage of higher ethanol blends as it finalizes standards for cars and light trucks. The testimony came during a public hearing to review EPA’s proposed Multi-Pollutant Emission Standards for model years 2027-2032. NCGA Chairman Chris Edgington expressed frustration that EPA has only looked at one solution, electric vehicles, for lowering greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions. “Unfortunately, EPA’s proposed multi-pollutant standards consider only one solution,” he said. “EPA’s proposal limits the ability of clean, low-carbon ethanol to contribute greater emission reductions and support affordable options.” Edgington encouraged EPA to address the serious limitations of its proposal and work with NCGA to level the playing field and advance the needed rulemaking to improve fuel standards. “Clean, high-octane fuel from mid-level ethanol blends, used as a system with advanced engines, offers an essential pathway for achieving significant greenhouse gas and complementary criteria emission reductions from model year 2027 and later vehicles,” said Edgington. “It also offers substantial public health and environmental justice benefits by reducing particulate matter emissions from gasoline.”",

    "content": "Corn growers are championing several priorities as Congress debates reauthorization of the farm bill with crop insurance protection being the top focus, a leader of the National Corn Growers Association said today in testimony before the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade. “We strongly oppose any efforts to restrict producer access to crop insurance products and oppose harmful program cuts that would negatively impact crop insurance products, their delivery, or the sound structure of the program,” said NCGA First Vice President Harold Wolle. During the hearing, which was held to elicit producer perspectives on the farm safety net, Wolle testified that NCGA supports increasing the affordability of crop insurance coverage. “Many corn growers purchase endorsement policies and higher levels of buy up coverage, but for others, the individual costs of purchasing coverage can discourage higher levels of coverage,” he said. Wolle also provided recommendations for the commodity title portion of the farm safety net, including ways to strengthen the Agriculture Risk Coverage County program and the Price Loss Coverage program. “Our farm bill recommendations seek to make USDA programs more effective and responsive through strategic investments and policy enhancements,” Wolle said. Wolle also touched on other farm bill priorities, saying NCGA supports expanding international markets by investing in trade promotion programs. NCGA also supports initiatives to make the existing working land conservation programs more effective in combatting weed resistance, reducing nutrient losses through farmer-led collaborative watershed projects, and speeding the development and adoption of innovative conservation practices. NCGA President Tom Haag highlighted NCGA’s priorities last Tuesday when he testified before the House Agriculture General Farm Commodities, Risk Management, and Credit Subcommittee. Both Haag and Wolle have said they look forward to working with the Agriculture Committees and Congress to pass a farm bill that works for stakeholders this year. Read the Written Testimony",

The 2023 National Corn Yield Contest (NCYC) opens today . . . and together, entrants will contribute their expertise and innovation to create a pool of agronomic knowledge that has been almost six decades in the making. This year, the contest has added a Nitrogen Management class. This new pilot class is open to the first 100 entries from Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio or Wisconsin. “We intend to keep the existing contest as it is for as many years as growers are interested in participating. But I do think there is this desire to keep building on the contest and exploring new opportunities,” said NCGA Director of Crop Inputs and Investor Relations Nicole Hasheider in a recent interview with NAFB. “So, this is very much a pilot year for the nitrogen management class, but we really do see this and hopefully some other categories down the line becoming permanent fixtures of the contest, and opening up those opportunities for growers who already participate in the contest to have a new challenge or opening up to some farmers who maybe haven't participated in the past and want to try something new and different.” The 2023 contest opens today with the entry period closing on August 16, 2023. All harvest forms will be due by November 30 and contest winners will be announced on December 13. Winners will receive national recognition in publications, such as the NCYC Corn Yield Guide. All 2023 winners will be honored at Commodity Classic 2024 in Houston, Texas. Questions? Contact NCYC at 636-733-5512 or email ncyc@ncga.com.

    "content": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced today that it will use existing authority to prevent drivers from losing access to lower-cost and lower-emission E15, a higher ethanol blend often marketed as Unleaded 88. The National Corn Growers Association and state corn grower organizations, which have advocated for the move, praised the decision. “We appreciate Administrator Regan’s timely action to prevent a disruption in E15 availability,” said National Corn Growers Association President Tom Haag. “EPA’s action will help address fuel supply constraints and ensure drivers continue to have access to a lower-cost fuel choice that cuts emissions.” The fuel market conditions that warranted EPA taking the same successful step last year continue today, Haag noted, and he said corn growers are proud to contribute to an energy and environmental solution that saves consumers money at the pump. Continued access to E15 during the summer months will help relieve ongoing energy supply pressures. When EPA took similar action last year, drivers saved nearly a dollar per gallon in some locations and an average of 23 cents per gallon during the summer months, according to data from the Minnesota Department of Commerce. E15 continues to save consumers significantly at the pump. Moreover, allowing uninterrupted E15 sales keeps a lower-emission fuel in the marketplace. In addition to being lower in carbon emissions, E15 has lower volatility than regular fuel, which is a 10% ethanol blend, and using E15 results in lower evaporative and exhaust emissions, important during the summer driving season.",

    "title": "NCGA President Outlines Farm Bill Priorities, Encourages Strategic Investments in Key USDA Programs",
    "content": "Corn growers are optimistic that Congress can make key farm bill programs more effective and responsive to the needs of farmers by making strategic investments and policy enhancements as it reauthorizes the farm bill, the president of the National Corn Growers Association said today. NCGA President Tom Haag, a Minnesota farmer, offered testimony before the House Agriculture General Farm Commodities, Risk Management, and Credit Subcommittee. The hearing, “Producer Perspectives on the 2023 Farm Bill,” focused on stakeholder priorities for the crop insurance and commodity titles. “Federal crop insurance has a proven track record of helping producers quickly respond to natural disasters,” Haag said. “Corn growers consistently rank crop insurance as the most important program and title of the farm bill. NCGA broadly supports increasing the affordability of crop insurance.” In addition to emphasizing corn growers’ support for crop insurance, Haag also offered recommendations for the commodity title. He said NCGA supports increasing the maximum rate in the Agriculture Risk Coverage County program to provide increased assistance to growers who experience significant revenue losses. Agriculture Risk Coverage County payment rates may not currently exceed ten percent of the county benchmark revenue, which limits assistance to farmers. “In 2020, growers across Iowa suffered major losses due to the derecho,” Haag said. “The yield losses were widespread and deep enough for ARC County to trigger payments in multiple counties, but the program’s effectiveness was restricted due to the limitation.” Haag said NCGA recommends increasing the coverage level for ARC County to make the program more responsive to revenue losses. NCGA supports improvement of the Price Loss Coverage program, Haag said, which provides important price protection for farmers. He noted that NCGA is focused primarily on improvements to the PLC effective reference price escalator. Improving it, Haag said, would allow the program to offer more responsive levels of protection that rise and fall in response to market prices. Haag also highlighted the importance of expanding international markets by investing in trade promotion programs that boost U.S. agricultural exports and help agriculture and related businesses in rural America. NCGA also supports multiple initiatives to make the existing working land conservation programs more effective. “We appreciate the budget challenges and varied approaches to current issues impacting the agricultural sector,” Haag said. “Our goal is to make USDA programs more effective and responsive through strategic investments and policy enhancements.” He said NCGA looks forward to working with Congress to pass a farm bill that works for farmers and stakeholders.

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is proud to announce the expansion of the National Corn Yield Contest (NCYC) to include a new pilot class focused on nitrogen management. The pilot allows corn growers to continue experimenting with practices that reduce inputs to optimize economics and environmental stewardship, while creating opportunities for current participants to pilot new practices, and new participants to join the contest. NCGA will partner with Verdesian Life Sciences to bring this new opportunity to corn growers for the 2023 contest, which launches on May 1. The pilot parameters are simple: growers will decide what nitrogen forms to use and when to apply, but total nitrogen applied must be 180 pounds or less. 2023 participation will be limited to the first 100 growers located in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, or Wisconsin. “One thing I know about corn farmers . . . they are #AllIn. They love to push themselves to be their personal best,” said NCGA President and Minnesota farmer Tom Haag. “This nitrogen management pilot allows for new players to become involved in the National Corn Yield Contest, and for our already-successful NCYC champions to apply their skillsets to a different challenge.” Although the National Corn Yield Contest is in its 58th year, it is still adept at taking cues from the continuous advances being made across the ag industry. Sustainability has been front and center for growers and stakeholders, and the new pilot class also aims to help NCGA achieve its 2030 goals. Verdesian believes that nutrient use efficiency is the next frontier in crop yield and quality, which aligns with the NCGA’s goals and goals for the pilot class. Together, NCGA and Verdesian seek to shed additional light on innovative best management practices (BMPs) that show promising yields with limited nitrogen inputs. “The partnership between Verdesian and NCGA on this nitrogen efficiency class aligns perfectly with our goal to promote practices and technologies that empower farmers to be sustainably profitable. Nitrogen efficiency is critical for both near-term yield gains and long-term sustainability at both the grower and industry level,” said Brady Eilers, Vice President of Global Marketing for Verdesian.

This open-innovation contest invites participants to answer the call and submit proposals for new uses of field corn as a primary feedstock for producing novel sustainable chemicals and products with quantifiable market demand. “Consumers have a genuine interest in biobased products; and corn is investing in solutions to meet that need,” said NCGA Market Development Action Team (MDAT) Chair and Colorado farmer Troy Schneider. “In order to continue drawing in the cutting-edge, game-changing participation we have seen for the past three years, the prize pool for the fourth challenge has been increased to $250,000.” Previous winners of the Consider Corn Challenge contests have scaled up to the next phase of development, received additional grant funding, entered into joint agreements and obtained registration for state biobased production incentives. “The Consider Corn Challenge brought Låkril Technologies visibility and contact with multiple corn growers associations and industrial corporations,” said Chris Nicholas, co-founder and president of Låkril Technologies and a past winner of Consider Corn Challenge III. “Relationships developed from this interaction allowed us to scale out and expand our business.” If all 15 winners of the Consider Corn Challenge I, II & III reached full commercialization with products available in the marketplace, the potential for additional corn demand would be approximately 3.4 billion bushels. “As corn farmers continue to press forward with advanced technology that allows them to do more with less, they are able to meet the growing needs for food, feed, fuel and new uses,” Schneider added. “This contest continues to help us think outside of the box and to meet the needs of our customers who are asking for sustainable, biobased products.” One to six winners will be selected for the Consider Corn Challenge IV, with a total prize pool of U.S. $250,000, split equally between winners. The submission deadline is June 30, 2023, at 5 p.m. CT; and winners will be announced at October’s Advanced Bioeconomy Leadership Conference (ABLC) in San Francisco.

    "content": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today released a proposal for new greenhouse gas and multi-pollutant emissions standards for light-duty vehicles, which does not adequately account for the environmental benefits of low-carbon ethanol. In response to the announcement, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) released the following statement: “While we share the administration’s goal of lowering emissions, we are frustrated that EPA appears to be turning exclusively to electric vehicles to lower greenhouse gas emissions. The limitations on raw materials, charging infrastructure, consumer preferences, and other factors dictate the need for a wider range of options to immediately mitigate carbon emissions. “We urge EPA and the Biden administration to focus on outcomes and opening pathways for all low-carbon fuels and technologies to help meet these strong standards, rather than appearing to focus on only enabling one technology in electric vehicles. Vehicle standards should help drive a level playing field that allows consumers access to a variety of clean vehicle and fuel options, including low-carbon ethanol, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 52%. “In previous rulemakings and prior to this proposal, we have urged EPA to set a federal minimum clean octane standard in conjunction with stricter vehicle standards. These cleaner fuels from mid-level ethanol blends would support advanced vehicles, offering an essential pathway for achieving significant GHG and complementary criteria pollutant emissions reductions. “We continue to urge EPA to provide a clean octane pathway to provide consumers with another affordable choice while also meeting the Biden administration’s climate and air quality objectives. We have also advocated for Congress to legislate on this issue through our support of the Next Generation Fuels Act. “We will be active participants in offering improvements to EPA’s proposed rule.”",

    "title": "Biofuel and Farm Leaders Press White House for Immediate Action on E15",
    "content": "Biofuel and farm leaders today called on President Biden to get ahead of rising fuel costs by authorizing sales of E15 this summer. In a letter, the National Corn Growers Association, along with five other groups, noted that current conditions are analogous to those in place last summer, when President Biden waived outdated Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) restrictions on E15. The move saved drivers up to nearly a dollar per gallon at the pump in some areas and an average of 23 cents per gallon, according to the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “The ongoing conflict in Ukraine, now extending into its second year, continues to reverberate across global energy markets,” said the letter, whose signatories included NCGA, Growth Energy, the Renewable Fuels Association, the National Sorghum Producers, the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union. “At home, this conflict continues to cause fuel supply disruptions, high gasoline prices, and ongoing uncertainty for millions of Americans. To help remedy these disruptions, provide stability for American families, and support domestic energy and economic security, we urge the administration to authorize the summer sale of gasoline blended with up to 15 percent ethanol (E15).” Advocates also outlined a range of “extreme and unusual” factors impacting the stability of U.S. fuel markets, including historically low domestic fuel inventories, record exports of U.S. fuel to allies overseas, and continued inflationary pressures on fuel consumers. Protecting summer access to E15 would help relieve pressure on U.S. fuel supplies, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, lowering evaporative emissions, and supporting America’s farmers and rural economies, they argued. “While a permanent solution that would allow E15 sales year-round remains an important necessity, we urge you to take action on a temporary, emergency RVP waiver as soon as possible to remedy current and expected supply challenges resulting from ongoing conflict in Ukraine,” concluded the letter.

    "title": "Corn Grower Leaders to EPA: Maintaining Consumer Access to E15 Increases Fuel Supply",
    "content": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should use its authority under the Clean Air Act to provide consumers with continued access to low-cost, low-emission E15 during the summer months, according to a letter sent today from corn grower leaders to EPA administrator Michael S. Regan. The president of the National Corn Growers Association, joined by leaders from 18 state corn grower groups, signed the letter, which called on EPA to replicate its actions from last year and ensure uninterrupted access to E15 through the summer. “At a time when fuel supplies remain constrained and prices remain high, consumers and retailers need all fuel choices available, especially as seasonal demand increases during the summer,” the farmer leaders stated. “Fuel market conditions that warranted EPA’s actions last summer are expected to continue this summer, and Russia’s war in Ukraine continues to disrupt global energy markets.” EPA approved E15, or 15 percent ethanol blends, in 2011 for use in all 2001 and newer vehicles, which account for more than 96 percent of vehicles on the road today. Retailers have increased availability of E15, often marketed as Unleaded 88, to offer consumers choice and lower fuel costs, as well as increase the fuel supply. E15 has been sold year-round for the past four years, but outdated regulatory barriers continue to hinder permanent full-market access to E15. NCGA and state corn grower associations reminded EPA officials that access to higher blends of ethanol can help keep prices down at the pump. The corn grower leaders pointed to warning signs, such as OPEC’s announcement of a 1.16 million barrels per day output reduction beginning in May, as reason the Biden administration should do everything possible to increase the domestic fuel supply to help keep prices down. “With ethanol currently priced around 50 cents less per gallon than unblended gasoline at wholesale, drivers are continuing to save up to 15 cents or more per gallon,” the growers stated. “As the number of retailers offering drivers this low-cost, low-emission choice increases, the economic benefits also expand.” Finally, the leaders noted that, in addition to increasing the fuel supply and lowering prices for drivers, higher ethanol blends like E15 reduce emissions. “Ethanol results in nearly 50 percent fewer GHG emissions than gasoline, so Increasing ethanol blending from 10 to 15 percent further cuts GHG emissions,” they said. “Blending more ethanol to make E15 displaces the most toxic aromatic hydrocarbon components in gasoline, reducing exhaust emissions for cleaner air.” The grower leaders urged EPA to act on their request in the near future to provide market certainty.",

    "content": "At the Advanced Bioeconomy Leadership Conference (ABLC) in Washington D.C., the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) once again sponsored and facilitated the Corn-to-Chemicals Summit, outlining the uses of corn as an industrial feedstock. The panel was moderated by Sarah McKay, NCGA Market Development Director, and participants included Nick Lepore, Morning Consult Senior Research Manager, and Denny Vennekotter, Vice Chair of Market Development Action Team (MDAT) and Ohio corn grower. The panel highlighted the survey results from the MDAT commissioned study on public perception of industrial biotechnology and support for a national incentive for biobased products. Vennekotter also shared his perspective on the value and sustainability of corn as an industrial feedstock and how utilizing corn addresses key areas of importance for the public as it relates to industrial biotechnology. Further, the panel had a robust Q&A session with the audience on programs and policies, including the national incentive for biobased materials that NCGA and BIO are currently working towards. “U.S. corn farmers continue to produce an affordable, high-quality and reliable crop each year,” said Vennekotter. “That crop can be turned into more than just food, feed and fuel. The corn kernel can be utilized in so many ways, which is why we focus on new uses and corn as an industrial feedstock.” NCGA continues work in the new uses and industrial feedstock space through the Consider Corn Challenge and will be launching a fourth Consider Corn Challenge on April 14th! NCGA also works to accelerate new uses through a partnership with DigestData, continued conversations with government agencies like the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO), and expanded focus on a potential national incentive program.

    "title": "House Members Reintroduce Next Generation Fuels Act",
    "content": "The Next Generation Fuels Act was reintroduced in the U.S. House of Representatives today. The National Corn Growers Association applauded the development, saying the legislation would help address the country’s most pressing energy issues through a transition to cleaner fuels and vehicles. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa) led the bipartisan reintroduction of the bill along with Reps. Angie Craig (D-Minn.), Darin LaHood (R-Ill.) and Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.) “We’re very grateful to Rep. Miller-Meeks, along with Reps. Craig, LaHood and Budzinski for taking the lead on this priority legislation for corn growers,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “Advancing the Next Generation Fuels Act is timely for Congress’ work on energy and environmental issues, offering solutions that lower fuel costs, reduce emissions and help shore up America’s energy security for the long run.” The Next Generation Fuels Act would clean up the nation’s fuel supply and transition new vehicles to use cleaner, more efficient fuels that also lower costs for drivers. By establishing a clean, high-octane standard for fuel and requiring that sources of additional octane result in at least 40% fewer greenhouse gas emissions, the legislation would allow automakers to significantly improve vehicle fuel efficiency through advanced engines. The legislation builds the nation’s clean energy progress by advancing higher ethanol blends and new vehicles that work together to deliver greater emission reductions, cost savings and consumer choice. As NCGA has called on the Biden administration to act to prevent a disruption in access to higher blends of ethanol this summer, the Next Generation Fuels Act would also permanently remove regulatory barriers, allowing for higher ethanol blends and advanced vehicles that maintain a wider range of competitive fuel and vehicle choices. In addition to the four lead House sponsors, Reps. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), Mike Bost (R-Ill.), André Carson (D-Ind.), Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), James Comer (R-Ky.), Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), Brad Finstad (R-Minn.), Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa), Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), Mary Miller (R-Ill.), Zach Nunn (R-Iowa), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Eric Sorenson (D-Ill.) also joined the legislation as original cosponsors.

    "content": "Last week, the U.S.A. Poultry Egg Export Council (USAPEEC) held their annual Strategic Planning Conference in Tokyo, Japan. Bringing together USAPEEC’s global staff and industry representatives from across the sector, the conference enables participants to analyze opportunities for expansion and barriers to market access, and then formulate strategy to increase and create additional demand for American poultry and egg products. Representing National Corn Grower Association’s Market Development Action Team was Michigan Corn Growers Association Vice President John Delmotte and NCGA Market Development Manager Michael Granché. On Thursday, Delmotte and Granché provided a presentation that highlighted the value of partnerships, highlighted goals and progress outlined within NCGA’s Sustainability Report, and illustrated how USAPEEC and NCGA have worked together through projects their Chicken, Egg, and Turkey Buyer’s Guides. “Most farmers think that our corn is exported as grain to other countries by ships and trains, but often forget that much of our grain is moved out of the country in animal and egg products. Being in Tokyo with the USAPEEC team really solidified the importance of our partnership with animal agriculture. Working with their global staff illustrated to me the work that these partner organizations do to help us move through meat and egg exports all across the globe. These partnerships are important and valuable to our organization,” said Delmotte. Poultry remains a top customer for U.S. corn consuming over 1,250 million bushels and last year, contributed $.28 cents of added value thanks to poultry exports! While in Tokyo, Delmotte and Granché discussed the importance of poultry exports with Agriculture of America’s Mike Pearson. Catch that interview here. To learn more about the U.S.A.

    "content": "Instability at some high-profile financial institutions is on growers' minds. Should we be worried? The Silicon Valley Bank collapse, and the sudden perception that there’s instability in the banking system, has a lot of us thinking back to 2008 and the financial crisis that spurred the Great Recession. And, whether it’s the war in Ukraine, lingering supply-side issues from COVID-19, or high-interest rates, we are all feeling the effects of the world economy a little more acutely this year. So are we staring down another financial crisis, or just feeling a little economic speed bump? For some perspectives on those questions, and what it means for corn growers, we’re joined in this episode by Krista Swanson, the National Corn Growers Association’s lead economist. She provides some much-needed context, and an informed take on what the farm economy might have in store for us over the next few years. Direct Share Link: https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ncga?selected=PDM9234930139 Transcript Krista Swanson: These recent bank failures, the Silicon Valley Bank, as well as the few others that we've seen with problems. When I think about the impact on rural banks that serve our agricultural community, I really don't think that this is a situation that impacts otherwise healthy institutions. Dusty Weis: Hello and welcome to the Cobcast, Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you're following this show in your favorite podcast app and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association Newsletter at ncga.com. I'm Dusty Weis, and in this episode, the Silicon Valley Bank collapse and the sudden perception that there's instability in the banking system has a lot of us thinking back to 2008 and the financial crisis that spurred the Great Recession. And whether it's the war in Ukraine, lingering supply side issues from COVID-19 or high interest rates, we're all feeling the effects of the world economy a little more acutely this year. So are we staring down another financial crisis or just feeling a little economic speed bump? Well, for some perspectives on that question and what it means for corn growers, we're joined today by Krista Swanson, the National Corn Growers Association's Lead Economist. Krista, thank you for chatting with us here today. Krista Swanson: Yeah, Dusty, great to be here. Thanks for having me on. Dusty Weis: So Krista, before we launch into all the dynamics of the current economic situation, can you tell us a little bit about yourself and how you made your way to the Corn Growers Association? Krista Swanson: Sure. So I have a master's degree in agricultural economics from the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign and- Dusty Weis: Oh, go Fighting Illini. Got to point out, my old man was an Illini. Krista Swanson: I've worked for more than a decade in the industry providing economic analysis. Most recently I served as a research specialist for the Gardener Agricultural Policy Program at the University of Illinois and was part of the farmdoc team. So got to be a part of a lot of the excellent research that team does there. Aside from working for National Corn Growers Association, I am actually also a corn farmer. My husband and I farm in Illinois where we grow corn and soybeans. So I had worked a lot with National Corn's growers, both as a grower member and as a consultant with some of my colleagues at the University of Illinois. So when this opportunity for the economist position opened up, I jumped on it and I'm happy to be here. Dusty Weis: Well, and we're happy to be talking to you today as well. Certainly a great perspective that you're able to bring to this discussion here and a lot of people asking questions and wondering how the current economic situation is going to affect their farming operations. So that farm to farm perspective, definitely appreciate it as well. But let's start with the most pressing issue here, the failure, the high profile failure, I'll add, of Silicon Valley Bank and the fear that this crisis could affect other banks. How bad is this situation and how is it going to impact particularly the rural banks that serve the agricultural community? Krista Swanson: So first I guess I want to address what is bank failure. And the most simple way to put that is that the bank can't make its obligations to depositors and creditors. And certainly the actions of the Federal Reserve over the past couple years have put some pressure on banks, but I wouldn't say that that's the main reason that SVB has had the problems that it's had. So when we think about what can cause a bank failure, it's often a combination of things like poor management, lack of diversification, being invested into high risk investments, economic downturn, and then of course things that the Federal Reserve is doing can also be contributing factors. I would say it's a little bit early to say how deep is this situation? If we think back to 2007 to 2009, it took a year and a half after the first institution failure before that really ballooned into a full-blown financial crisis. And I don't want to imply that that's in store here because this is a much different set of circumstances, but I think it's important to remember that we're only a couple weeks into this. When I think about the impact on rural banks that serve our agricultural community, I really don't think that this is a situation that impacts otherwise healthy institutions. And again, SVB was doing some things a little bit different than maybe what we would see some of our banks that are serving the ag community doing in terms of their type of investments and really their overall loan portfolio and the deposit side of that as well. Also, there were some tweets happening leading up to the SVB situation that sort of caused a mass panic that led to a mass withdrawal of deposits. And so one thing I want to remind listeners is if this situation has you feeling anxious, you could always review your institution's financial report, look for things like strong credit metrics, low delinquencies, contact your bank officer if you're looking for some peace of mind. Overall, I would say that the banks that farmers are dealing with are probably not impacted by the same set of circumstances that SVB was. Dusty Weis: Right. And I want to come back to this notion of deposits being protected in a little bit here, but first I want to sort of dig in on the mechanics of a bank run. And again, not an economist, but I did see It's a Wonderful Life when I was a kid. And so I think back to that famous scene where there's a bank run there and in the heart of the Great Depression and Jimmy Stewart jumps up and says, \"Your money's not here. It's in Bill's house and it's in Joe's house.\" And a bank like SVB, they hold the money from depositors and invest it to earn interest and dividends. And so if there is that sudden surge of people who want to withdraw their money and those investments can't be cashed out to pay everyone, you've essentially got a recipe for bank failure. Isn't that essentially what happened with Silicon Valley Bank here? Krista Swanson: Yes. But again, to be clear, they had some other sort of credit management issues happening. But yeah, like you mentioned, It's a Wonderful Life is probably the easiest way for people to understand this concept. And I mean the way that banks normally operate is they take in those deposits and then they loan out that money. That bank isn't just holding that money forever until a person comes back to withdraw it. And again, this is a normal practice for banks, kind of like the Bailey Brothers Build and Loan. Banks just don't have that cash available to repay depositors if a large number of people want to come in and make withdrawals all at the same time. So even otherwise healthy banks can be destroyed when we have this crisis of confidence. And it's really important to have diversification in that loan portfolio. So SVB was heavily invested in tech and venture startups. A lot of the depositors were all of the same sort of circle, so to speak, and they were heavily invested in treasuries. Banks can have a wide range of earning assets as opposed to just in treasuries. So while it's true that that's how banks make money is by loaning out, that money lent out could be diversified into other types of assets. Dusty Weis: Right, instead of just having all their eggs in one basket. I think some of the irony there too is that treasuries are typically considered a really safe investment unless the interest rate goes up a whole lot suddenly and then they're not providing the sort of yield that other investment opportunities are. That created the perception of weakness then that caused all of the depositors to essentially say, \"I'm worried about my deposit, I'd like to take that out now.\" And the whole house of cards came down just because they weren't properly diversified. Krista Swanson: Yep, and that's true. So treasuries would normally be considered a relatively safe deposit, but I think that a well-managed financial institution would also see the value in diversification beyond just that. Again, you just don't want all of your eggs in one basket. Dusty Weis: Right. Now, another point that you mentioned here is the protection for your deposits. As I understand most accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, more commonly called the FDIC, which is an independent agency created by Congress. What does that insurance cover exactly? Krista Swanson: So that insurance covers deposits of up to 250,000 per depositor, per bank and per ownership category. So if you have a person with say, $1 million to deposit into a bank, that person may want to consider putting 250,000 into four different banks just to be sure that they are not exceeding that insured level of deposits. But a lot of times if you're working with a financial institution, you have a relationship with someone there and they want all of your business. And so like with SVB, they had a lot of wealthy depositors and businesses that had deposits exceeding that 250,000. They actually had an extremely high rate of uninsured deposits, which is extremely, extremely large. Most banks have much, much lower rates of that. So in this case, FDIC has taken over Silicon Valley Bank to cover all of their deposits in a reaction to this situation. And I just saw the other day that FDIC reporting that no depositor has lost any of their insured money because of bank failure since FDIC insurance began. So again, a little bit of a peace of mind statement and knowing that this is something that's been put in place and is working as it should covering that, if you're depositing in a way that you're keeping in mind what that insurance provides. Dusty Weis: Now the FDIC stepping in to insure all deposits, even beyond that $250,000, what is typically considered the limit there? That's sort of an extraordinary step that they took there, but just so we're clear, that extra coverage, that's not coming from our tax money, right? Krista Swanson: No. So that money is going to be coming, there actually is what's called a deposit insurance fund, which I just read in the past few days, currently has $128 billion in it. So there is an existing fund to provide a backup for a situation like this. Where that money and that fund is coming from is quarterly fees levy on banks. It is not something owed by taxpayers. Dusty Weis: So looking ahead to the future then, and certainly as someone who remembers the Great Recession of 2008, as you do as well, how can we prevent these types of situations from happening again? Didn't we have safeguards in place after the financial crisis of 2008? Krista Swanson: Yeah, you're right. There were some safeguards put into place after that financial crisis and I think that these recent bank failures, the Silicon Valley Bank as well as the few others that we've seen with problems throughout the month of March here, these recent bank failures do raise some questions. And so I don't know that I really have the answers, but I would say that this situation is certainly an opportunity to evaluate why there were no red flags raised before we got to this point, and it's an opportunity for improvement for the future. I will note that the Federal Reserve announced on March 13th that it would review the supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank and release the report prior to May 1st. So that is something that we can watch for that maybe will help us answer some of these questions. Dusty Weis: Might be able to learn a little bit more about what happened. And again, hindsight being 2020, maybe we can apply a little bit of that facing the future here as well. I read somewhere that Silicon Valley Bank was the 16th largest bank in the US when it failed, which is kind of spectacular, but it is still considered a mid-sized regional bank in the grand scheme of things. Now I know a lot of growers who prefer to do business with their local small town banks, which are usually also considered small to mid-size. So how are they different than from Silicon Valley Bank, both in the investment strategies that they utilize and in their management structure? Krista Swanson: So Silicon Valley Bank, like you pointed out, even despite being the 16th largest bank in the US at the time that it failed, is still sort of in this mid-size regional bank group. I think when we talk about mid-size regional banks or smaller to mid-size regional banks, I feel like that's a really huge spectrum. When we think about some of our smaller or community type of banks that a lot of farmers or those involved in agriculture may deal with, it's sort of a different type of category. Another thing to keep in mind is that SVB was heavily invested in technology and venture type of startups and so had a lot of the same type of, their portfolio was very heavily concentrated, which is something that most of the time the management strategy would be to avoid that. So when I think about some of the smaller and mid-size community banks in my area, I guess as an example, they have loans that are deployed into agriculture, other types of small businesses, residential mortgage. They are sort of spread out among a bunch of different types of industries where if there were challenges in that particular industry, it wouldn't necessarily wipe out such a large segment of their portfolio. So I think that's an important thing to know. And again, this is something that you can either ask of your bank officer or investigate yourself. If you're wanting to know what type of portfolio your bank has and evaluate some of their management on your own, that is something that you can find available online or talk with someone at your bank and say that you want to know how is your bank managed differently than SVB, for example. Dusty Weis: And I think for a lot of people who are layman like me, I think it's just enough to know that it is being managed differently from SVB. Getting into the details of exactly how it's different is maybe not something that I'm going to comprehend necessarily, but knowing that that money is being spread out as loans to my neighbor and mortgages for the folks down the street and equipment loans for the grower down the road, it's a lot easier to comprehend exactly where that money is and again, the Bailey Bros. Building and Loan, that's something that I understand. Krista Swanson: Yeah, for sure. I think that that's where your relationship with your bank and I feel like farmers, that's probably something that's really important to them. I imagine that virtually all farmers probably have a relationship with the person that they're banking with where they can call them up and ask these types of questions and get those answers. And I'd venture to say that most will be pleased with what they hear in terms of how they're being managed well and differently than what we saw with SVB. Dusty Weis: Probably not a lot of cryptocurrency in the investment portfolio. Like your small town community bank. Krista Swanson: Probably not as much. Yeah. Dusty Weis: Shifting focus a little bit then to the broader economic landscape. It's an interesting economy right now. It's kind of tough to describe. In a lot of ways, it appears pretty strong; in other ways, there appears to be some shaky ground. The job market, very steady right now, but interest rates are sky-high and grocery prices have been through the roof. Everything is expensive right now because of inflation. So how do we get in this situation, Krista? Krista Swanson: Yeah, so like you mentioned, we're certainly getting some mixed signals from the current economy. Like you noted, the labor market is strong both in terms of job growth and wage rates. It's really exceeding what would be expected in this inflationary environment and given the Fed's efforts to combat that with those interest rate pikes. You mentioned grocery store prices. I have four children and a husband who all like to eat. So when I go to the grocery store, I feel like I'm buying about the same amount of food as I did a year ago, but it's costing twice as much. And when I'm buying groceries, I think baseball great Yogi Berra, known for saying \"A nickel ain't worth a dime anymore,\" and if I were to relate that to my grocery bill, it might be $100 ain't worth 200 anymore. Dusty Weis: I've just taken to asking the cashier for a blindfold and a cigarette with every bill that I get. It's just ... Krista Swanson: Yeah. But what I've tried to convey here is that the purchasing power of money has declined as inflation has increased over these past few years. And you asked, how did we get in this situation? I really feel like it's a chain of events that started all the way back with COVID and really particularly more so than COVID, the shutdowns that resulted and we had this really short but severe recession that happened, and at that time inflation was near 0% and so the fed's target rate of inflation is actually 2%. And if you look back from the mid-'80s all the way up until pre COVID, we were really close to that 2% line for that almost four decade period. And so we saw inflation drop down to about 0% and then we had what I'll say three things happen. First we had supply chain disruptions, which changes in consumer demand and both of these impacted prices to an extent. Second, we had an influx of government spending, so we had these huge spending packages that were COVID related aid and recovery legislation pieces, which spurs government spending into the economy. And then third, we had the Federal Reserve. One of their tools is called open market operations, and they were utilizing this tool to increase the money supply. So what they were doing was they were purchasing treasuries and other bonds from financial institutions and they did this aggressively, they increased the money supply by 40% in a two-year period. I would say that this is probably the biggest driver in getting us into this really high inflation environment. And so these tools are great to use to pull us out of a recession, but the goal was to get back to a 2% inflation rate. The problem with the tools is that you can overshoot pretty easily. So that's sort of what we saw happen here is that the Fed increased the money supply to such a great extent, and as the economy reopened and we had consumers with pent-up demand and all these things happening at the same time, we blew right past 2% and went far above that. Dusty Weis: Right. Well, and now it seems like the Fed is using these interest rate hikes and big ones and coming in really quick succession as well to sort of try to put the brakes on that inflation after it's kind of gone crazy. Is that the right approach here or are there other tools in the Fed's toolkit to head off inflation that did not involve these higher interest rates that admittedly are tough for everybody? Krista Swanson: Yeah, so the fed's focus has been on using interest rates and admittedly I feel like as just people in the United States, that's what we're hearing a lot about. But the Fed is actually also using another tool. I talked about open market operations being a factor in how we got to this point. The Fed did reverse course about a year ago in late spring 2022, so they had been from the 2020 recession up until that point, increasing the money supply, they reversed course and began to tighten the money supply by selling treasuries and bonds and letting some of their matured bonds fall off their balance sheet. So again, the opposite action that they were taking to increase the money supply. We aren't hearing as much about that, but they are utilizing that tool as well. Again, interest rate increases are what we tend to hear a lot about, and I feel like that's what we see. If you're a consumer, and we talked about purchases at the grocery store, or if you're a farmer in you're borrowing money to operate, that's where you're feeling the pain is on those interest rates, whereas those open market operation actions are impacting our day-to-day pocketbook to the same extent. I would say that we're likely to continue to see interest rate increases a little bit more before we see a reversal in action on that. So at the March 2023 Fed meeting, we did see a 25 basis point increase in interest rates, and I feel like that was a tough situation. The Fed had been using this data-driven approach. We've heard that a lot from the Federal Reserve over the past year in making those calls on interest rates. This whole banking situation definitely influenced their action. Prior to that emerging, they had been talking about a 50 basis point increase. So we did see them sort of find a happy medium between 50 basis points and no action, which could have had some repercussions in the marketplace as well. Anyway, I think we'll continue to see that bump a little bit higher before we see relief on interest rates. Dusty Weis: So for those of us who are in a position where my wife and I, we've had three kids in the last five years, and that old house that we've had for a while is starting to feel a little bit small. It doesn't sound like there's much hope of an interest rate decrease in the immediate future. Krista Swanson: Well, I'm not sure on that. Let's talk about the consumer price indexes, one of the measures of inflation, but it's sort of the one that we utilize the most often. So we reached the high point, consumer price index was at 9% in summer 2022, and in the most recent February 2023 index, it was down to 6%, and that's a year-over-year change in this consumer price index. So it took us about a half a year to drop from about 9% to 6%. And like I mentioned earlier, our target rate, our goal rate is 2%, and so we still have another 4% to go to get down to that 2%. Now, I think that this 4% will happen faster than what we've seen so far because we sort of have this lagged impact. The Fed keeps raising interest rates and sometimes it takes a while for the impact of that to sort of flow through the economy. So I do think that throughout 2023 we'll start to see the impact of some of those increases that we've had already, where they're not going to need to act to the same extent that we've seen, thankfully, aside from some other major unforeseen thing in the economy. It does seem like from what I'm reading from experts in this realm of economics, that we could start to see an increase late in 2023. More likely we'll see the Fed reach this point where they stop raising rates maybe mid-year and then continue to hold for a while before they start to reverse course, sort of a holding period to allow the impact of what's going to happen to happen. But again, the banking situation has sort of changed up maybe how they would've normally acted. So something to watch is certainly comments coming from the Fed over the next few months that provides some indication of where they're heading. Dusty Weis: Well, I'll probably plan to just hunker down and enjoy the pandemonium in the small house for at least another year here then, but good to know that there might be relief in sight down the line here. Let's change it up a little bit. You and your husband are growers. Let's take a quick walk through the farm field here. Tight margins continue to be a concern for farmers. Over the last year, we've faced skyrocketing prices of inputs, fertilizer especially. Can you tell us why fertilizer has been such a hot-button issue with corn growers? Krista Swanson: Yeah, so fertilizer has been a big issue for corn for a few reasons, and I would say it's an issue for all farmers, but corn maybe feels the pain of this a little bit more. First of all, when we think about some of our primary plant nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous and potassium, there really is no substitute in growing a healthy plant to those. And so having access to those nutrients is really important and that comes at a high cost, especially for corn. That's because corn has greater relative fertility needs than some of our other commodity crops. Fertilizer is normally about one-third of the total operating cost incurred in growing a corn crop, but we saw fertilizer prices increase rapidly from late 2020 through spring 2022, and in recent months, we've seen fertilizer prices decline from those highs, but they're still quite high compared to 2008 through 2020. And so that's definitely hitting those farm operating budgets hard and on top of price increases, we also have growers are concerned about supply and availability, getting that fertilizer at the right time that they need, also some changes in fertilizer industry structure and tariffs on some imported fertilizers. So the US is in a good position where we have some resources domestically, but we do also rely on some imports of fertilizer. And so NCGA is advocating for fair and open access to imported fertilizers to help make sure that the growers have the inputs that they need to raise a healthy and productive crop. Dusty Weis: As we look ahead to the next few years here, then, for corn farmers, what are the economic indicators telling us that we can expect to see? Krista Swanson: Well, there's certainly a lot of general economic and geopolitical uncertainty right now, and some of these things, in particular, are out of the ordinary, but I always like to remember that farmers are pretty accustomed to operating in uncertain environments, so the dynamics of that environment are constantly changing and may be new, but farming, in general, carries a lot of uncertainty. So tying into the focus of today's discussion, I think farmers should expect interest rates at the current level to slightly higher for the next year and make plans for capital purchases or operating needs accordingly. Like you were talking about looking for more living space farmers, I would say apply the same to your business decisions. Sometimes you can't hold off on those things, but if you have that option, you may see some relief on the interest side as we look out over the next year. So something to keep in mind if you do have some control over when to do those things. When we think about the farm operating budget, we already talked about fertilizer prices and the pressure that that's putting. USDA is projecting lower net returns than we've seen over the past two years, but still positive margins. So despite lower prices, there has been some relief on the cost side of the equation. Overall, though, we did come off of two very high-income years, and so we need to adjust to this tighter margin environment. I feel like one of the challenges that farmers will have specifically for 2023 and corn is this potential disparity between when inputs were purchased and when grain is marketed, because we've seen some large swings in fertilizer prices. When we look at the fall contracts for corn and the volatility in those contracts, since I'm talking about December 23 futures for instance, you look at the range at which that contract has moved, if you made some early sales versus sales today, it makes a big difference in where your overall farm margin might end up. So again, this could be an issue for some farms, it may not be for others, and certainly, we have time left yet to be seen where maybe we'll see some good opportunities for higher prices for the '23 crop here before it's all said and done. Dusty Weis: Right. Yeah. Well, it's certainly a lot of plates spinning in the air here, and you've got your hands full, keeping an eye on them, and just because it's in the news every day and every other talking head has weighed in on it already, I'm going to ask you too, because I want to get your take here. Are we headed for a recession? Or can we still pull off that soft landing like the Federal Reserve says that they're shooting for? 30 seconds or less. Krista Swanson: Yeah, again, I would not say that this in particular is my area of expertise, so I'm sort of gathering my opinion from following a lot of what I would say are the experts. The things I'm reading more over the past, more recently since we've had this banking crisis, I do think that there's a lot of indicators that are showing that recession is coming. It may not be a severe recession, but it does look like that is likely. Dusty Weis: Right. Yeah, well, I'll take an unsevere recession, I guess, I suppose. Well, Krista Swanson, it has been an absolute pleasure chatting with you here. There's a lot of good information here, probably some things that are going to come as a relief to growers throughout the country as well. So thank you so much for joining us here on the Cobcast. Krista Swanson: Thank you so much for having me. Dusty Weis: And thank you for listening.

    "title": "Senators Reintroduce Next Generation Fuels Act",
    "content": "The Next Generation Fuels Act was reintroduced in the U.S. Senate today, drawing praise from the National Corn Growers Association. The legislation, which has been one of NCGA’s top advocacy priorities, would lower fuel prices, reduce carbon emissions and help shore up America’s energy security. Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) led the bipartisan Senate reintroduction along with Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). “We’re very grateful to Sen. Grassley, along with Sens. Klobuchar, Ernst and Duckworth, for taking the lead on this priority legislation for corn growers,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “The Next Generation Fuels Act addresses some of the country’s most pressing concerns by providing consumers with more options in the transition to cleaner fuels and vehicles and supporting our long-term energy security.” The Next Generation Fuels Act would clean up our nation’s fuel supply and transition new vehicles to use cleaner, more efficient fuels that also lower costs for drivers. By establishing a clean, high-octane standard for fuel and requiring that sources of additional octane result in at least 40% fewer greenhouse gas emissions, the legislation would allow automakers to significantly improve vehicle fuel efficiency through advanced engines. The legislation builds on our nation’s clean energy progress by advancing higher ethanol blends and new vehicles that work together to deliver greater emission reductions, cost savings and consumer choice. As NCGA has called on the Biden administration to act to prevent a disruption in access to higher blends of ethanol this summer, the Next Generation Fuels Act would also permanently remove regulatory barriers, allowing for higher ethanol blends and advanced vehicles that deliver greater emission reductions and cost savings in order to maintain a wider range of competitive fuel and vehicle choices.",

    "title": "NCGA President to EPA: Ensure Consumer Access to Higher Ethanol Blends",
    "content": "The president of the National Corn Growers Association urged EPA officials today to implement a petition from Midwest governors that would remove barriers to higher blends of ethanol and avoid further delay. EPA’s public hearing reviewed the agency’s recent proposal to implement a plan from eight Midwest governors to require lower-volatility gasoline so drivers in those states continue to have year-round access to fuel with 15 percent ethanol, often marketed as Unleaded 88. EPA has proposed delaying implementation of the governors’ plan until 2024. Haag took issue with the delays to date and urged EPA to avoid further delays in implementation. He also highlighted the emissions reduction benefits of E15 and the current cost savings of up to 20 cents or more per gallon when drivers choose E15. “We are disappointed with EPA’s delayed response to states,” Minnesota farmer and NCGA President Tom Haag told EPA officials during the public hearing. “Governors submitted their initial request a year ago, allowing sufficient time for EPA to respond and implement for 2023. However, given the delayed response, we now strongly urge EPA to implement this rule with an effective date of April 28, 2024 -- as proposed --without further delay.” Haag also took the opportunity to renew the ask for the Biden administration to also again act as summer approached to prevent a disruption in E15 availability in 2023 and increase the fuel supply, the same successful action EPA took last year.",

The 2023 event broke the previous Commodity Classic record of 9,770 attendees, which was held in New Orleans in 2016. “The excitement in Orlando was energizing,” said George Goblish, a Minnesota farmer, ASA member, and co-chair of the 2023 Commodity Classic. “We knew going into the event that registration was up 30% over last year, but to have a record-breaking show just blew us away.” Kenny Hartman, an Illinois farmer, NCGA member, and fellow 2023 co-chair, said, “There’s nothing like connecting in person, and it just felt like everyone was so excited to come together again to see the best agriculture has to offer. I can’t wait to see everyone again at the 2024 Commodity Classic in Houston.” This year’s event featured more than 30 educational sessions, a sold-out trade show with over 400 exhibitors, a keynote address by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, and policy meetings of the sponsoring commodity associations. Attendees enjoyed a wide variety of presentations from top farmers and well-known industry leaders along with tours of popular Orlando attractions. Guests were also treated to the Saturday night Evening of Entertainment with legendary rock band .38 Special. The 2024 Commodity Classic will be held February 29 – March 2, 2024, in Houston, TX. For information, visit CommodityClassic.com. Established in 1996, Commodity Classic is America’s largest farmer-led, farmer-focused agricultural and educational experience.

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association looks forward to seeing the next steps that will be taken as a part of the Farmers for Soil Health. NCGA is a founding member of FSH, which was awarded the $95 million grant from the USDA’s Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program that makes this work possible. “This grant provides technical and financial resources to mitigate the risk farmers increasingly face due to severe climate events,” said NCGA President Tom Haag, a farmer from Eden Valley, Minn. “It is exciting to see that this effort to promote cover crops will reach acreage producing over 85 percent of the nation’s corn and soybeans.” The program, which will help double acreage nationally by 2030, will offer farmers three years of declining cost share payments to help them transition to cover crops. FSH will work with data insights and publishing company DTN to develop a digital platform that will use satellite imagery, allowing farmers to receive an “eco-score” for corn and soybeans produced with cover crops and conservation tillage. This platform will facilitate the marketing of crops to parties interested in securing a documented source of sustainably produced corn and soybeans. FSH is a collaborative effort of the American Soybean Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Pork Board and the United Soybean Board with the mission to advance conservation practices to improve soil health across the U.S. The grant will fund cost share and technical assistance for cover crops to 8,000-10,000 farmers on 1.44 million acres of corn and soybeans. To execute this grant, FSH will receive technical assistance from the National Association of Conservation Districts, The Sustainability Consortium, Soil Health Institute, University of Missouri Center for Regenerative Agriculture, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, DTN, National Center for Appropriate Technology, and Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural America. For more information, contact FSH Executive Director Dr. Ben West at bwest572@gmail.com or visit Farmers for Soil Health.",

Over 20 corn state grower affiliate associations also signed the letter with NCGA. “We write to express our strong support for providing the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and House Committee on Agriculture with sufficient budgetary resources to write a new bipartisan, multi-year, comprehensive, and meaningful piece of legislation,” the letter read. The letter noted that farm bill budget resources are needed for “protecting and enhancing crop insurance to assist with volatile weather and crop loss, improving access to voluntary conservation incentives, addressing rural development needs, investing in research for innovation and competitiveness, providing opportunities to help the nation become more energy independent and food secure, and supporting solutions to address logistics challenges.” Congress is working to reauthorize the Farm Bill before it expires on September 30, 2023.",

    "title": "Bills Providing Permanent E15 Fix Introduced in House and Senate",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association today applauded members of the House and Senate for reintroducing legislation that would provide a permanent, nationwide solution to ensure uninterrupted market access for low-cost, low-emission E15, often marketed as Unleaded 88. Led by Sens. Deb Fischer (Neb.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Reps. Angie Craig (Minn.), Adrian Smith (Neb.) and Dusty Johnson (S.D.), 35 bipartisan Senate and House members introduced the Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act, which has again drawn support from a wide range of agriculture, fuel and retail stakeholders. “The choice of cleaner and less expensive E15 at the pump saves drivers millions of dollars a year and increases the fuel supply to improve our energy security,” said Tom Haag, National Corn Growers Association President. “We thank these bipartisan members of Congress for once again leading on this needed solution to resolve an outdated barrier to consumer choice. There’s no reason for market access to a safe, clean and affordable fuel option to remain in question, and we urge Congress to pass this commonsense legislation.” Despite EPA approving E15 for use in all 2001 and newer vehicles, 96 percent of vehicles now on the road, and a 2019 update to regulations, a 2021 court decision would have ended year-round market access to E15 last summer without the Biden administration using emergency authority to keep E15 in the market. The administration’s temporary action increased the fuel supply and reduced fuel prices, but fuel choice is again in question for 2023, even though E15 has now been available year-round for consumers the past four years. Most recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed to implement a plan from eight Midwest governors to require lower-volatility gasoline in their states aimed at ensuring drivers in those states continue to have year-round access to fuel with 15 percent ethanol. However, EPA has proposed to delay implementation until 2024. NCGA supported the governors’ plan and expressed serious concern over the one-year delay in implementation and the market uncertainty the delay creates for 2023. NCGA also supported the recent bipartisan request from 17 U.S. Senators to President Biden, asking him to direct EPA to again use the agency’s existing authority to increase the fuel supply through uninterrupted access to E15 this summer. Last year, as the nation faced fuel supply challenges, President Biden directed EPA to use existing agency authority to prevent a disruption in E15 availability between June 1 and Sept. 15. As a result, continued availability of E15 increased the nation’s fuel supply and saved drivers an average of 16 cents per gallon nationwide during those three months, for a total savings of $57 million. “We urge the Biden administration to use this existing authority to keep this fuel choice in the market and increase the fuel supply, but we also call on Congress to resolve this fuel market uncertainty once and for all by passing the legislation introduced today,” said Haag. Retailers have increased availability of E15, often marketed as Unleaded 88, to offer consumers choice and lower fuel costs, as well as increase the fuel supply. Ensuring continued E15 sales year-round keeps a lower-emission fuel choice in the marketplace that costs less. E15 cuts evaporative, carbon and tailpipe emissions compared to standard 10 percent ethanol blended fuels. Blending more ethanol to make E15 displaces more toxic components in gasoline, reducing exhaust emissions for cleaner air.",

    "title": "Ag & Bioscience Groups: Its Time for Action on Mexicos Biotech Corn Ban",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association, along with a broad coalition of national and state agriculture and bioscience organizations, sent a letter to President Biden this week to thank the administration for beginning technical consultations with Mexico concerning its action to ban imports of biotech corn. The letter calls for those consultations to start without delay. “We support your administration’s request for consultations with Mexico regarding its treatment of agricultural biotechnology and denying the use of certain crop protection tools, to provide a framework and timeline to resolve this issue,” the 62 groups wrote. “We look forward to these consultations beginning promptly.” Technical consultations bring leaders from the involved countries, which now includes Canada as well, into formal discussions to resolve the dispute. If the talks are not successful, the U.S. can initiate a dispute settlement under USMCA. The organizations expressed appreciation for the administration’s efforts over several months to resolve the issue through negotiations but indicated that the results, including a revised decree that Mexico issued Feb. 13, 2023, are inadequate, and now it is time for action. The new decree, which the groups said drew a non-science based distinction between corn for food and corn for feed and industrial uses, is inconsistent with USMCA obligations. The new decree “continues to limit the use of innovative agricultural tools, extends restrictions on safe crop protection products, and enacts barriers to trade,” the groups wrote, and it “fails to establish a science- and risk-based regulatory approval process for all agricultural biotechnology products and ignores the immediate need to establish a risk assessment process for gene editing technology.” The agricultural and biotechnology groups reiterated the importance of beginning the legal process to not only resolve the dispute with Mexico but also prevent other countries from following suit. “The United States must use the dispute mechanisms afforded in trade agreements like the USMCA to ensure trade barriers or domestic policies do not limit the tools U.S. farmers have to sustainably produce food for our ever-growing world population,” the letter concludes. “Sending a strong signal on enforcement will serve as a critical precedent for other trading partners.” Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador issued a decree in December 2020 to phase out imports of genetically modified corn by 2024. Mexico’s revised decree, issued last month, clarified that the ban applied to corn for food use effective immediately and could apply to feed corn in the future. Mexico is a top market for U.S. corn exports, which are mostly genetically modified corn.",

    "title": "U.S. Trade Representative Initiates Consultation with Mexico Over Biotech Corn, Putting U.S. Closer to Dispute Settlement Under USMCA",
    "content": "The U.S. Trade Representative today initiated a technical consultation with Mexico, a move that puts the U.S. one step away from filing a full dispute settlement under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement over the aggressive steps Mexico has taken to ban biotech corn. Mexico is a top market for corn, the number one agricultural export from the U.S. The National Corn Growers Association, which along with affiliated state associations, has been leading calls for the Biden administration to act, applauded the development and urged USTR to expedite the process. “We are pleased USTR is taking the next step to hold Mexican officials accountable for the commitments they made under USMCA, which include accepting both biotech and non-biotech commodities,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “Mexico’s position on biotech corn is already creating uncertainty, so we need U.S officials to move swiftly and do everything it takes to eliminate this trade barrier in the very near future.” A technical consultation will bring leaders from both countries into formal discussions. As part of the process, which can happen in person or virtually, both countries can tap their experts to share information on agricultural biotechnology. If this step does not resolve the impasse, the U.S. can then initiate a dispute settlement under USMCA. Once a dispute settlement is filed, a group of experts are empaneled to hear the case and make final determinations based on the commitments both parties signed as part of the free trade agreement. The dispute over biotech corn stems from a 2020 decree by Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador that sought to ban imports of biotech corn beginning in January 2024. Mexico issued a revised decree in February that banned biotech corn for food usage and left the door open for a future ban on biotech corn for feed, effective immediately. Most corn grown in the U.S. is biotech corn, and Mexico has historically been one of America’s top customers. The ban raises concerns for U.S. farmers and rural economies, but also for the people of Mexico. According to a study by World Perspectives, Inc., the decree would raise tortilla prices in Mexico by 40% in the first year and 16% over time. Given the high stakes, NCGA and corn grower leaders across the country began to sound the alarm last fall and have been calling on the Biden administration to initiate a dispute settlement under USMCA. Mexico’s decree is not based on sound scientific evidence. Regulators and health organizations around the world, from the World Health Organization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, have confirmed the safety and benefits of biotech crops for decades.",

    "title": "NCGA Expresses Concern with Delayed Implementation of Governors Effort to Ensure Year-Round E15",
    "content": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today proposed to implement a plan from eight Midwest governors to require lower-volatility gasoline in their states aimed at ensuring drivers in those states continue to have year-round access to fuel with 15 percent ethanol. However, EPA proposed to delay implementation until 2024. The National Corn Growers Association supported the governors’ plan and expressed serious concern over the one-year delay in implementation and the market uncertainty the delay creates for E15 in 2023. “These governors took the initiative and used authority under the law to ensure their consumers could maintain access to low-cost, low-emissions E15,” said National Corn Growers Association President Tom Haag. “These governors did the right thing, but EPA’s proposal delays this solution. Higher ethanol blends lower emissions, save drivers money and allow for consumer choice. With the proposed delay in implementation, we now urge EPA to use existing authority to prevent a disruption in E15 availability this summer.” EPA approved 15 percent ethanol blends, or E15, in 2011 for use in all 2001 and newer vehicles, which account for more than 96 percent of vehicles on the road today. Retailers have increased availability of E15, often marketed as Unleaded 88, to offer consumers choice and lower fuel costs, as well as increase the fuel supply. E15 has been sold year-round for the past four years, but outdated regulatory barriers continue to hinder permanent full-market access to E15. Last year, as the nation faced fuel supply challenges, President Biden directed EPA to use existing agency authority to prevent a disruption in E15 availability between June 1 and Sept. 15. As a result, continued availability of E15 increased the nation’s fuel supply and saved drivers an average of 16 cents per gallon nationwide. In April of 2022, several Midwest governors informed EPA of their decision on lower-volatility gasoline. The Clean Air Act gives governors the authority to act on these matters as they consider their states’ consumers and air quality. The Act gives EPA 90 days to approve the governors’ plans. However, EPA took 10 months to issue the proposal, which now includes a delay in implementation until 2024. On Tuesday, 17 U.S. senators called on President Biden to direct EPA to again use the agency’s existing authority to allow for the continued use of E15 through this summer. NCGA supports the senators’ request and strongly urges EPA to use its authority to increase the fuel supply through uninterrupted access to E15.",

    "title": "Senators to Biden: Direct EPA to Prevent Disruption in Consumer Access to E15",
    "content": "A group of bipartisan U.S. senators, led by Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), sent a letter today asking President Biden to direct the Environmental Protection Agency to use existing authority to prevent the disruption of sales of E15, often marketed as Unleaded 88, again this summer. NCGA expressed strong support for the senators’ request and urged the Biden administration to take this needed action to bring certainty to the fuel marketplace. “We appreciate the senators getting ahead of the problem and proposing a solution to prevent a disruption in E15 availability this summer,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “Ensuring continued availability of low-cost, low-emission E15 increases our domestic supply in the face of ongoing global energy uncertainty. The Biden administration took the same action last year, successfully boosting the fuel supply while lowering costs for drivers. We support the senators’ timely request for this no-cost energy security solution.” The Senators letter to President Biden (link to letter) states, “Taking early action on E15 will send timely and necessary signals across the energy supply chain so that fuel producers and retailers will have the certainty they need to ensure affordable, reliable and cleaner fuel options for American consumers throughout the year. Further, U.S. use of E15 will continue to displace Russian oil and finished gasoline products, ease domestic and global supply constraints, and lower net domestic fuel prices.” Nearly 3,000 retail locations offer consumers the choice of E15. This action from the Biden administration last summer increased the fuel supply and saved consumers an average of 16 cents per gallon nationwide. In addition to Sens. Thune and Durbin, the letter was signed by Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.).",

Caskey will assume the role on Monday, February 27. NCGA board members say they are pleased to name someone of Caskey’s caliber to the top job. “Neil’s experience in agriculture is extensive, and he is well known as someone who gets the job done well,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “The board and I are certain that Neil will usher in new ideas and take the organization to new heights.” Caskey has served as NCGA’s vice president of communications and industry relations for over four years and spent over a decade promoting agricultural issues as executive vice president at OBP Agency, a leading advertising and public relations firm. His professional background also includes work for the American Soybean Association and as a legislative aide for a U.S. member of Congress. Caskey said he is looking forward to leading the organization. “It is quite an honor to lead an organization that I care so much about,” said Caskey. “We have a great team in place, and I look forward to forging full-speed ahead and pushing for wins on some of our top issues, like the Next Generation Fuels Act, fighting Mexico’s ban on genetically modified corn and securing reauthorization of the farm bill. NCGA is on the move.” As vice president of NCGA, Caskey has been at the forefront of some of the organization’s top issues. Most recently, he has played a leading role in challenging Mexico on its efforts to ban genetically modified corn. Thanks to the efforts of NCGA on that front, the Biden administration has threatened to file a dissent decree if Mexico doesn’t reverse its actions. Caskey holds a B.A. in political science from the University of Missouri-Columbia and an MBA from Webster University.",

    "title": "As Mexico Implements New Decree, NCGA Amplifies Call for Biden Administration to Initiate Dispute Settlement Under USMCA",
    "content": "Mexico officials issued a new decree on Monday calling for a ban on imports of biotech corn used for certain purposes, effective today. The decree also indicated the Mexican government would continue to allow imports of biotech corn used as animal feed while exploring substitutes. NCGA expressed serious concern with the accelerated implementation timeline. “The Biden administration has been more than patient with Mexico as U.S. officials have sought to enforce a rules-based trading system and stand up for American farmers,” said National Corn Growers Association President Tom Haag. “The integrity of USMCA, signed by Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador himself, is at stake. Singling out corn – our number one ag export to Mexico – and hastening an import ban on numerous food-grade uses makes USMCA a dead letter unless it’s enforced.” President López Obrador initiated a decree in late 2020 that would ban imports of biotech corn effective January 31, 2024. The Biden administration and Congress have worked closely with Mexican officials over the last several months to head off the ban, which would be catastrophic for American corn growers as well as the Mexican people, who depend on corn as a major staple of their food supply. Those talks culminated in a letter from a Biden administration official late last week calling for Mexico to provide further explanation and justification for the original decree. While the Mexican government had appeared to be seeking a more pragmatic position to promote food security in recent weeks, the latest decree sends a message that Mexico is doubling down on its original position. Biotechnology has revolutionized farming, allowing farmers to grow more corn and other crops to feed more people using less land, chemicals and resources. U.S. regulators and leading science and health organizations around the world have determined and long maintained that biotech products currently on the market are safe and beneficial.",

    "title": "NCGA to EPA: Higher Renewable Fuel Volumes Good for Economy, Energy Security and Environment",
    "content": "Higher renewable fuel volumes over the next three years would go a long way in improving energy security, lowering gas prices and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, according to recent comments the National Corn Growers Association submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS, requires that U.S. transportation fuel contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel each year. NCGA’s comments were in response to EPA’s proposed volume requirements for 2023, 2024 and 2025. “NCGA supports EPA’s proposal of annual increases in volumes, including an implied conventional biofuel volume of 15.25 billion gallons, and recognition that ethanol plays a critical role in cutting GHG emissions and our energy security,” stated NCGA President Tom Haag in the comments. “With continued pressure on energy security and costs, and the need to accelerate GHG emission reductions, however, biofuels can contribute even more. We ask EPA to continue working with us on complementary policies to advance higher ethanol blends, enabling ethanol to do more to cut emissions and costs.” NCGA also noted that renewable fuel adds more than 20 billion gallons to the nation’s fuel supply annually, lowering consumer costs, creating rural jobs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 1 billion metric tons since the RFS was enacted. As producers of the primary feedstock for low carbon ethanol, corn farmers contribute to the success of the RFS through higher corn yields and enhanced sustainability. Haag noted that by producing more corn with less land and fewer resources, famers cut the carbon intensity of ethanol while meeting food, feed, export and fuel needs. NCGA also urged EPA to adopt the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Lab GREET model for lifecycle GHG assessment. “EPA acknowledges that its 2010 modeling framework is old and requires updating,” said Haag. “Yet instead of adopting the federal government’s most robust and updated analysis, EPA uses outdated estimates in the proposal while continuing modeling reviews.” Additionally, NCGA strongly urged EPA to separate the proposal for renewable electricity, or eRINs, from the volume proposal, allowing additional time for consideration because the proposal is inconsistent with the way the RFS functions for other renewable fuels. NCGA members also weighed in directly with EPA on the proposal, with 2,164 farmers submitting individual comments. With the RFS comment period now closed, EPA faces a June deadline to issue a final volume rule.",

    "title": "Reduced Ethanol Demand Drives Corn Ending Stocks Higher",
    "content": "The following is a brief analysis by Krista Swanson, the lead economist for the National Corn Growers Association. Projected corn ethanol use for the 2022/23 marketing year declined by 25 million bushels from last month, according to this week’s UDSA World Agriculture Supply & Demand Estimates report. As the only change on the supply or demand side of the corn balance sheet, it resulted in a corresponding increase of 25 million bushels in projected corn ending stocks for the current marketing year. Despite a return to the post-COVID normal in 2022, fuel ethanol produced using corn trailed the years leading up to the 2020 COVID disruptions. From 2017 to 2019, the average annual fuel ethanol production was 15.9 billion gallons, calculated using data from the U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA). After dropping to 13.9 billion gallons in 2020 and recovering to 15.0 billion gallons in 2021, production in 2022 was 15.4 billion gallons. This is 88% of the 17.4 billion gallon per year total of U.S. ethanol production capacity. The EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook, released earlier this week, projects a 2023 fuel ethanol production of 15.2 billion gallons, a 1% decline from 2022. Though not a significant reduction from 2022, the sector is falling about 5% short of the pre-COVID production levels. Among the factors that impact ethanol production are motor gas consumption and ethanol blend rate. Motor Gas Consumption – Motor gas consumption fell to 123.4 billion gallons in 2020, a 13.7% decline from the 2017 to 2019 annual average of 142.9 billion gallons. Consumption improved to 135.1 billion gallons in 2021 before falling to 134.6 billion gallons in 2022. The EIA outlook projects further decline in motor gasoline consumption in 2023 and again in 2024, dropping to 133.8 billion gallons. Statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation shows that vehicle traffic volume for 2022 was back to pre-COVID levels, indicating that miles driven is not a factor in lower ethanol use. An increase in vehicle fuel efficiency or increasing adoption of hybrid or electric vehicles may be contributing factors now and into future years. Given ethanol is an input in motor gasoline, the decline in motor gas consumption is another factor in declining ethanol use. Ethanol Blend Rate – The ethanol blend rate, the amount of ethanol blended relative to the amount of motor gasoline consumed, has moved incrementally higher annually but still would round to 10% for the past decade. This is not surprising given nearly all gas sold in the U.S. contains 10% ethanol. Higher blends such as E15, marketed as UNL88 and E85, are available in various markets across the U.S. Expansion of and availability of higher ethanol blends is needed to break through this 10% blend wall. The capacity for greater corn ethanol production is already available, and the U.S. could be using more of it. Corn ethanol is an immediate climate change solution as a low-carbon, clean energy source and an affordable, homegrown fuel. Corn ethanol is uniquely positioned to play a larger role in the future of transportation fuels. Last year, the Next Generation Fuels Act was introduced in the House and Senate, which would remove barriers to blends of ethanol up to 30%.",

    "content": "The unnecessary ban on biotech corn would take effect next year, cost 32,000 U.S. jobs annually, and worsen food insecurity in Mexico. A major disruption to the market for U.S. corn is set to take effect in one year, as a decree by Mexico’s President would ban the import of GMO corn effective January 31, 2024.

Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to the Cobcast: Inside the Grind with the National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway, we're making sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you're following the show on your favorite podcast app and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. A major disruption to the market for US corn is set to take effect in one year as a decree by Mexico's president would ban the import of GMO corn effective January 31st, 2024. Historically, Mexico was the number one market for US corn, and so it should surprise no one that the NCGA has been active in pushing back, with strong support from the Biden Administration in Washington. The NCGA is urging the administration to hold the line and file a settlement dispute under the USMCA to hold Mexico accountable to their obligations under that trade agreement. And so, in order to build awareness of the issue in Congress, on January 31st, we held a well-attended briefing for congressional staffers with an all-star panel of experts. Joining us were Congressman Adrian Smith from Nebraska, the Chair of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Trade in Foreign Agricultural Affairs, Jason Hafemeister. NCGA President Tom Haag was there to offer leadership's perspective, and Nebraska grower Andy Jobman gave us the view from the farm field. The discussion was moderated by NCGA Vice President of Communications, Neil Caskey. Neil Caskey: Let's go ahead and get started. Tom, from a grower point of view, help us understand what Mexico means to US farmers. Tom Haag: What it means for us is that they're neighbors, therefore, importing our corn to theirs is less distance than we have to worry about going to China or whatever. But there are also our largest importer of our yellow corn and white corn, which is $10.3 billion a year. And if we would happen to lose some of that over this issue, it would be huge for the American farmer because 90% of the corn that we grow is GMO corn. That would be the first major thing right there, Neil, that would be a big impact to the US corn farmer. At NCGA, we represent 26 affiliated states and a little bit less than 40,000 members, but we have 300,000 corn farmers that pay checkoff dues to their estate, so it would be a big impact. Neil Caskey: Andy, anything you want to add to that from your perspective? Andy Jobman: Yeah, so on our particular farm, we raise a lot of food grade white and yellow corn. Actually, all of it is food grade, white and yellow. Most of it stays domestic for a major domestic corn ship processor, but we do have extra white corn that we do sell to a vendor that ships that corn to Mexico and to Central America. This last year, about 50% of that extra corn that I grew on my farm went to Mexico. So when we hear rumors and threats of that market shutting down, it definitely hits really home for me and a lot of producers in Nebraska. Nebraska's the number one white corn producing state in the nation, so that's a little bit unique for Nebraska. But overall, the impact of this decree really would set a precedent that we do not want to be set, and that's this stigmatism against GMO crops. We've been producing GMO crops on our farms for over 20 years, and the science is solid behind it in terms of the safety, in terms of what we can do for conservation and stewardship, and I think we'll talk a little bit about that later. You think about the American corn farmer's role in protecting our environment, leaving a very small environmental impact and very small carbon footprint, we can't do that without GMO crops. I think GMO technology is extremely, extremely important to agriculture in the US and the rest of the world too. Neil Caskey: So shifting gears just a bit, I want to talk a little bit about the US-Mexico-Canada agreement. So Congressman Smith, obviously you were on the committee that helped with that trade agreement. And so, tell us what that agreement did for agriculture in general and in corn I guess in particular that helped put us in a better spot. Congressman Adrian Smith: It strengthened our position. Certainly, when you look at the broader context of what NAFTA had done for agriculture, more specifically though, agriculture had done so well under NAFTA that when there was a renegotiation, it did make a lot of agriculture a little bit nervous, but it showed that we can get this done. And so, it updated NAFTA, added biotechnology, for example. Imagine that given the events of the day or of these few months of how Mexico is treating us. And so, yes, there is a dispute settlement, but that was updated as well. I hope that we won't need a dispute settlement ultimately, but I'm just hoping that this tension between Mexico and the US specifically on white corn can be resolved. As Andy mentioned, we do not want dangerous precedents to be set that give other countries other ideas when it's politically motivated, it's not scientifically based. It's politically motivated, and it's very damaging I think ultimately to trade generically. We don't need more challenges with trade especially when we face, I think, an unlevel playing field around the world. I think it's just so helpful. I think getting USMCA done was a result of really leaning in on trade issues to get that done. The world was watching. A lot of folks said it could never be done, and yet USMCA was done, it was done for the right reasons. I think it was the most bipartisan trade agreement in modern history. There were more Democrats who voted for it than Republicans. Of course, the Democrats had majority at the time, but that's not always the case. And so I just think we should use this as leverage now moving forward, but obviously to make sure we enforce what we have. Neil Caskey: Deputy Undersecretary Hafemeister, this question is for you. So 10 months, I guess, after that agreement was ratified, then we got a curve ball out of Mexico with this decree. Can you help us understand what happened and what they're trying to do with this ban on GM corn? Jason Hafemeister: Yep, for sure. In January of 2021, Mexico instituted a decree related to corn in particular, but more broadly about biotechnology. The objective of this decree was to set up a phase-out of the use of biotech in food products and particularly for corn. This phase-out would be implemented by January of 2024, so a little over a year from now. And in the interim, Mexico, their government was charging the country to find an alternative to the use particularly of herbicide-resistant traits, but also to biotech products in general. And so, while trade has continued in the interim, so Mexico continues to be a big market for us, we've had problems that they have not been approving new traits. New seeds that are being developed by companies that have new positive traits that our farmers want to have access to, they're not being legalized for sale in Mexico. The Mexican government under this decree is preparing to eventually ban the import of any biotech corn products. So, this is a big problem for us for several reasons. One, Mexico's an important commercial market for us, not just for corn, but for a lot of products. We want to make sure that commerce is not unfairly burdened. So we have a commercial interest in making sure that the market stays open as was promised to us under NAFTA and then USMCA. Second, there's a particular need we have to really show that we're serious about trade. There's a lot of concern in the public in the US that trade agreements are unfair, they're not delivering for America, that other countries are taking advantage of us. This is really creating a lot of resistance to trade, which is a problem for us in agriculture since trade is so critical to our livelihood. We want to make sure that we make the point that we are enforcing trade agreements, that these agreements that are benefiting our farmers we're going to keep them in place and be respected. Third, there's a real technology issue here. We're really banking on these genetic modifications, old school and new school, to help improve farm income. These can help increase yields and reduce costs for our farmers. This can help increase the food availability globally. We think that's critical for global food security. And third, we really think these technologies are going to be pivotable to addressing the climate challenge. And so, if these technologies are stifled because a key market is making it illegal to market that crop, that's going to have a lot of negative repercussions. Even if we can keep the market open for old-style seeds, that's not going to address all these promises that we see in the new technology going forward. Finally, we're worried about Mexico. They are big importers of corn. Their livestock industry depends on corn. This helps feed Mexicans. This helps spread the dollar in a Mexican pocket. We're not interested in seeing the cost of living go up in Mexico. So for all those reasons, we've really jumped on this one. Neil Caskey: So Andy, when I think about the farm gate implications, I think about the impacts on your particular farm. And so, could you talk a little bit about why that is and maybe even go beyond just the effects of your farm and just talk about the broader US corn industry as well, the effects of this proposed ban? Andy Jobman: Yeah, so I'll walk everyone through a short timeline of what it takes to put in a crop. The crop that we're going to plant here in a few months in April for the 2023 crop, a lot of those seed decisions, what hybrid to plant, how much of it, et cetera, et cetera, I've made all those decisions already. A lot of times that's coming in the fall before. A lot of that is just driven by various market forces and opportunities to purchase at a discount. But a lot of times I'm set by the time January one rolls around with pretty much what I'm going to plant. Walking that back even further, that seed that I'm purchasing from a retailer, a seed company or a local cooperative or whatever, that was grown in the season prior to that. The season prior to that is when the seed companies or our retailers were making decisions on, \"Okay, what kind of seed will our farmer want to plant two seasons from now?\" And so, I hope that illustrates the complexity of the whole grain channel. From developing seeds clear to delivering a final product from the farm gate to an end user, it's three to four years in one turn, in one cycle. And so, to simply flip a switch on and off between wanting non-GMO or wanting GMO from our trade partners is just simply logistically impossible because it takes so long to develop these lines of corn, it takes obviously a whole growing season to raise it, and then it's going to stay in the grain channel, in the supply channel for another at least a year. So this is a very complex industry. And then you throw on top of all of that the requirements that you would need to isolate non-GMO grain from GMO grain from the farm gate clear to the end user, wherever that end user may be, that's a whole nother complicated situation too. That's why you see farmers and associations really, really step back and say, \"Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, we can't just do this on a whim.\" In a lot of cases, it undermines the technology and the advancements that we've seen already in our crop production when it comes to improving soil health, using less energy, being more environmentally friendly, and also raising a much higher quality product. I mean, we can't do that without GMO technology today. I've drawn the similarity of we're moving backwards if we would do that. It would be getting rid of electricity and going back to candles, basically, if we get rid of GMO technology. Neil Caskey: Yeah, thanks, Andy. We've been grateful to have wonderful support on Capitol Hill, and Congressman Smith, that's a big credit to your leadership and all the things that you've done. Could you just help us understand all the activity, all the bipartisan support that we have on Capitol Hill for this particular issue and maybe where that might be going into the future? Congressman Adrian Smith: Yeah, I appreciate the support of many of my Democratic colleagues who are sharing the same concerns about what we're talking about. This issue is not just about us, this is about feeding the world. Andy just talked about taking a step back from electricity back to candles. Imagine if we didn't have GMOs, I mean, we'd need more water, more chemical. So it's actually good for the environment to head in a direction utilizing a biotechnology for the future and that we can all benefit from that. What is lost all too often in terms of trade discussions is the impact on consumers. I've heard from Mexico actually some folks concerned about the president's policies there in Mexico, that this is not friendly to consumers in their own country. I would hope that we would all be sensitive to that because trade policy, whether it's us, whether it's consumers in another country, it impacts all of us. Neil Caskey: It does indeed. I know that we're grateful for the support of the administration as well. This next question is for you, Deputy Undersecretary Hafemeister. I know that this has been going on for some time, but the talks, the negotiations have certainly heated up in recent weeks. I don't know if you could just shed some light on where we've been and where things are on that end. Jason Hafemeister: Yeah, I'll put in some context. So in 2021, Secretary Vilsack made his first international trip down to Mexico, met with the Mexican government, including the president, and heard back from them some of their priorities. Some of it was heritage related. Mexico says, \"We are the cradle of corn. We don't want to have these new strange varieties coming in and contaminate the pure Mexican corn. So that's why we don't want it.\" Some of it is health, that there's some belief in some places, Mexico and US, that biotech or some of the herbicides used around it are not healthy. And so, that's part of the reason. Part of it is a generalized fear of biotech. These were some of the things that are in the air down there. Secretary Vilsack was able to make the case both in 2021 and he went back in 2022 to talk about the safety of these products, the legality under the trade agreement where we're obligated to have access, the economics for American corn farmers as well as Mexican consumers, and the importance to the relationship that Mexico really needs to take a hard look at this decree. And so, we've been in conversation with Mexico since then. There's really, I guess, three things to keep an eye on. One is the overarching decree. This is a regulation, something that comes out of the office of the president down there that sets out this vision of transitioning away from biotech. So that decree on its face is problematic. Second is the approvals of new varieties have been stopped. And so, that's stopping the commercialization of corn and some other grains that could be sold down there and stopping our farmers from planting them. And then the third is any related trade regulations that might go in place to try and otherwise restrict or channel these products. So those are the three tools, the three instruments that we're paying attention to. We've been clear with the Mexicans that this really needs to be solved. It's not the kind of thing that is easily compromised because it's about science, it's about law, it's about economics. And so, we're asking them to look at those instruments and to reform them. We're in conversation in December, the Mexican government sent up four of their ministers, agriculture and trade and foreign ministry and health ministry, they came to Washington. Secretary Vilsack again encouraged them to dig deep and make the reforms. And so, those conversations are ongoing. Last week, our new undersecretary for trade, Alexis Taylor, went down there with our new trade ambassador from US Chair, Doug McCaleb, and really reaffirmed that some of these halfway measures that Mexico had been floating really don't do it, we really need to see reform. So that's where we're in our talks with Mexico. Neil Caskey: Oh, very good. So just one final question relates to President Obrador. We know that his term will be ending in 2024, and I guess this is for anyone that might want to field it, any speculation on what that might mean on this particular decree? Congressman Adrian Smith: I'm not a political scientist internationally, but just watching this issue with the various countries around the world, and let's face it, Europe, UK more specifically I should say, the UK, they say they left the EU because of too many regulations, but then they want to keep them on agriculture. This seems to be perhaps a poultry issue more than others, but they keep coming and wanting to visit with me saying they want a trade agreement, but they expect to exclude agriculture. I'm like, \"I don't know how you pass a trade agreement in the US in the Congress here without agriculture.\" The number one trade constituency, I think, here in these parts of America anyway. So it's a political football. I do worry that not enough is being done to actually get some movement from the president of Mexico because it seems to center around his personal preferences there. I haven't even studied all of the political dynamics associated with it, but imagine... A long time ago, I don't know if you guys saw that Jimmy Kimmel did Man on the Street, interviewing 10 people, you probably watched this, asking them what GMO stood for. I think one out of the 10 kind of got it right. So that's what we're up against. We've seen the politics of different aspects of food production and livestock agriculture as well, animal agriculture. It can get out of hand really quickly, and who suffers the most? Consumers. You would think there'd be a little more understanding these days just with the cost of eggs. Now that's different reason perhaps, but there's just so much that goes on that I hope that we can have a discussion with stakeholders that can elevate the back and forth. Now, to Undersecretary's point earlier about the negative connotations of trade, it's interesting because I agree that over the years there have been developing negative connotations in discussions about trade. And then circa 2017, here comes some tariffs. The coffee shops across America blew up about tariffs. \"What do tariffs do? What do they not do? What could be the results? What's the leverage attempt here?\" And so there was all of this concern about tariffs. I get it, I'm not a big fan of tariffs either. But I do believe that it elevated the discussions in coffee shops across America about trade, and that helped us get some things done in the previous administration as it relates to trade. And so, I hope that we can push forward by leaning in on these trade issues, whether it's with Kenya or whether it is holding UK's feet to the fire on how badly do they want a trade agreement and other opportunities. We hear a lot about labor and environment and how these other countries unfairly engage with labor and environment. Well, imagine if we had no trade agreements whatsoever. What would be the state of labor and environment around the world in other countries? So trade agreements actually give us more leverage to set the standard, I think a positive standard with how employees should be treated and what is good for the environment. That becomes a win-win when we can level the playing field and being able to sell more of our products around the world when we know we're really good at feeding the world. We don't want to see unnecessary, unreasonable regulations stand in the way. Neil Caskey: We'll bring it home with some final thoughts. We'll start down on that side of the table, Deputy Under Secretary with you. Anything that we didn't cover that you would want to bring up? Jason Hafemeister: Nope. Just to say appreciate the chance to talk about this, a big priority for us. We know it's real important to our stakeholders and just important for the relationship with Mexico, the technology. A lot's at stake here. We're we're very much doubling down on it. This is going to be a big year. Farmers are getting ready to plant in the spring for a crop they'll harvest in the fall and sell into the winter. And if Mexico doesn't change this regulation, they won't be able to sell these in January in Mexico. So now really is the time for Mexico to make the change. We're definitely using all the tools we can to try and convince them of that and just appreciate the help we've gotten from stakeholders from the Hill and from everybody. Andy Jobman: Well, I would, as a corn farmer, just want to voice appreciation for administration and the USDA and USTR for getting engaged on this. It is a huge issue, like you said, Under Secretary. The science and the truth are definitely on our side. We would really encourage administration to really hold the line on this issue. Secretary Vilsack I think recently said that there is no compromise that is acceptable from our standpoint. I think that's a really, really strong statement that we're 100% behind. The corn chips that are in my pantry are the same corn chips that everyone else in the nation buys. I feed GMOs to my family, as do all farmers across the nation. It's safe, it's reliable. You talk about food security, environmental, social benefits, there's just a win-win-win there. There's great synergism between science and the social benefits as well as the environmental, so yeah, a huge issue that we're going to continue to work on and strive for that positive outcome of keeping that trade relationship with Mexico. Tom Haag: I've got a few comments here just as we've been going on. Well, the American corn farmer has been working hard the last seven to eight years on sustainability, and we're gaining more every year. The farmer's doing a better job of taking care of the land every year. 35 years ago when I started farming, 40 years ago when I started farming, complete different practices back then compared to what we do now. At one time back, we had to say it wasn't black and where I lived, you can't plant it. Well, now we can use vertical tillage just because of the technology and all that, and we're proving it can work. The Mexican government would like to say, \"Corn farmers from the US, this is what we want you to do.\" We don't want another country telling us that we should have to farm that way. We know what we're growing. We know we're growing a safe product. Like Andy said, it's been 20-plus years since we've been growing this. The thing that also comes up, and representative Smith mentioned it, it's going to cost us more to grow that non-GMO corn, so that means the price goes up. We've got $7 corn right now, we might need $11 corn in order to break even so. But then we export it to them, it's going to be that much more expensive for that Mexican consumer to buy the product compared to what they're buying it for right now. So we can see more of the pluses going our way, and that's why GMO has been proven itself to be a very, very good product for us. One last thing I would like to chew too is what Andy just mentioned. Back in December, our CEO got a call from Secretary Vilsack saying, \"I just had a meeting with the Mexican entourage with my group.\" And he says, \"We're staying strong.\" He says, \"Let's not give in.\" Well, then last week when USTR and USDA were down there, when they came back home and said, \"No, no deals, we're staying to our rules.\" Let the trade agreement work, that's what we're here for. And with the administration saying the same thing, that is what our NCGA wants to hear, that they're behind us and that they believe in the American corn farmer and what we're doing. Thank you. Neil Caskey: Well, thank you all for a great conversation. Mexico's a great neighbor. They're also a great customer of our corn. I heard it from Congressman Smith and Andy, the win-win term. This proposed ban is a lose-lose for our two countries. We're grateful for the bipartisan support that we have for the administration and Congressman Smith, all you're doing on Capitol Hill. Because of that, we're optimistic that we're going to have a positive resolution soon. We need that sooner rather than later given that the clock is ticking. January 31st, 2024, that is the date that we're working for. And so, with that, I want to say thank you on behalf of National Corn Farmers Association. Thank you for coming here. Thank you for our panelists and our leadership here in Washington. Thanks. Dusty Weis: Once again, a big thank you to all our guests in this Capitol Hill Congressional Briefing, Congressman Adrian Smith from Nebraska, Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, Jason Hafemeister, NCGA president, Tom Haag, Nebraska grower, Andy Jobman.

    "title": "Corn Grower Leaders, Joined by Administration and Congressional Officials, Warn of Consequences from Mexico Decree, Call for Swift Action",
    "content": "During a congressional briefing today, corn growers told members of Congress and their staff that U.S. officials should continue to hold the line with Mexico over a proposed ban that would block most U.S. corn imports into that country. During the discussion, growers emphasized that the ban would land a significant blow to the American economy. The statements included praise from corn growers for the Biden administration’s most recent action, which took a tough position with Mexico over the proposed ban. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced in late 2020 that he would implement a decree banning biotech corn into the country beginning in early 2024. The vast majority of U.S. corn is biotech. The briefing, hosted by the National Corn Growers Association, was held on the one-year mark from the decree’s effective date. “This decree would cut most American corn growers off from what has historically been our largest export market,” NCGA President Tom Haag noted after the briefing. “That’s why it is extremely important that U.S. officials continue to ensure that Mexico lives up to its commitments under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.” Haag was joined on the panel by Andy Jobman, a farmer and chairman of the Nebraska Corn Growers Association; Representative Adrian Smith (R-Neb.); and Jason Hafemeister, acting deputy for trade at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The panelists talked about the important role biotech corn plays in crop production and the harm that would come if farmers were to move away from biotech corn. “It would undermine the technology and the advancements that we’ve seen in our crop protection,” noted Jobman. “When it comes to improving soil health, using less energy, being more environmentally friendly and raising a much higher quality product, we can’t do that without biotechnology. It would be like getting rid of electricity and going back to candles.” Others echoed Jobman’ s comments. “Imagine if we didn’t have [biotechnology],” Smith noted. “We would have to rely more on chemicals, so [biotechnology] is good for the environment.” According to forecasts, the ban on biotech corn would cause the U.S. economy to lose $73.8 billion over ten years in economic output along with 32,217 jobs annually with labor income falling $18 billion. The Biden administration began talks with Mexican officials late last year and Mexico offered a revised decree. Last week, President Biden dispatched senior aides from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the office of the U. S. Trade Representative to Mexico City to meet with officials in the López Obrador administration. In a statement following the meeting, USTR and USDA officials said the revised decree offered by Mexico to date was not sufficient. The officials said they made it clear to their Mexican counterparts that they are considering all options, including taking formal steps to enforce the issue under the USMCA. Hafemeister said the administration is paying attention to the overarching decree, the fact that Mexico’s approval process for new varieties has been stopped and any related trade regulations that might place restrictions or channel those using biotechnology. “We have been clear with the Mexicans that this really needs to be solved,” Hafemeister noted. “It’s not the kind of thing that is easily compromised because it is about science, it’s about the law, it’s about economics. So, we are asking them to look at those instruments and reform them.” NCGA applauded the Biden administration for rejecting the most recent proposal, which would have undermined science-based regulatory principles, violated USMCA and set a negative global precedent. Panelists during today’s briefing echoed that sentiment.",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association joined over 60 groups in sending letters to key decision makers in the Biden administration and Congress opposing cuts to the federal crop insurance program during the upcoming fiscal year 2024 budget and appropriations processes. “The last several years have brought an onslaught of uncertainty for America’s farmers and ranchers – from weather extremes to the disruptions of international markets to COVID-19 and all of its unique challenges,” the letter explains. “During this tumultuous time, one of the few certainties that farmers could rely on was the protection provided by the federal crop insurance policy purchased with their hard-earned dollars.” Protecting crop insurance continues to be a top issue for NCGA and our grower members. NCGA President Tom Haag has provided congressional testimony on the importance of the program. “Our number one priority for the farm bill is to protect crop insurance from harmful budget cuts and reforms,” Haag said.

    "title": "Corn Growers Praise Biden Officials for Stance on Biotech Corn",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association praised the Biden administration today for issuing an official rejection of a recent proposed compromise from Mexico on biotech corn imports into the country. The development came during a meeting between Mexican officials and U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Secretary of Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs Alexis Taylor and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative’s chief ag negotiator Doug McKalip. In a statement that came after the meeting, USTR and USDA said the changes offered by Mexico “are not sufficient and Mexico’s proposed approach, which is not grounded in science, still threatens to disrupt billions of dollars in bilateral agricultural trade, cause serious economic harm to U.S. farmers and Mexican livestock producers, and stifle important innovations needed to help producers respond to pressing climate and food security challenges.” The statement also said that the U.S. officials made it clear to their Mexican counterparts that they are considering all options, including taking formal steps to enforce the issue under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. NCGA applauded the development. “This is a significant development and good news for corn growers,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “Secretary Vilsack and USTR Ambassador Tai are making it crystal clear that they are going to make the Mexican government abide by what it agreed to under USMCA. These leaders understand that banning biotech corn would deliver a blow to American farmers and exacerbate current food insecurity in Mexico by drastically raising prices for corn, basic foods and other critical products derived from corn in the Mexican economy.” Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced in late 2020 that he would implement a decree banning biotech corn into the country, beginning in early 2024. The majority of U.S. corn is biotech. As pressure on Mexico has grown, thanks to efforts by NCGA and the Biden administration, corn growers have become increasingly concerned that Mexico would offer a compromise removing the ban on imports of corn used for livestock feed while moving forward with the proposed ban on corn for human consumption. The Biden administration’s statement today shows there is no room for such a compromise. The administration’s actions come after the presidents of 23 state corn grower groups, joined by the president of the National Corn Growers Association, sent a letter to President Biden in December calling for him to take additional steps to address the pending decree by Mexico that would block imports of biotech corn.",

    "title": "USDA Lowers Expected Corn Ending Stocks for 2022/23",
    "content": "The following is a brief analysis by Krista Swanson, the lead economist for the National Corn Growers Association. The United States Department of Agriculture released the January World Agricultural Supply & Demand Estimates (WASDE) report yesterday. The expected reductions in use were met with notable changes to U.S. production that resulted in lower-than-expected ending stocks for the 2022/23 marketing year. As compared to the December WASDE report, a 200 million bushel drop in total production was spurred by a 1.6 million acre cut in final 2022 harvested acres, more than offsetting a one bushel per acre increase in yield to 173.3 bushels per acre. The downward adjustment to 79.2 million harvested acres brings 2022 harvested acres to the lowest level since 2008. This translates to 89.4% of planted corn acres harvested in 2022, the lowest share of planted acres harvested since 2002. The decline in harvested acres from the December report was highly concentrated in four states, with Kansas (-710,000 acres) and Nebraska (-480,000 acres) accounting for nearly three-quarters of the total and South Dakota (-240,000 acres) and Colorado (-120,000 acres) rounding out most of the remaining quarter. Compared to 2021, 2022 harvested acres of corn silage were 75% higher in Kansas and 65% higher in Nebraska. Given the negative impact of drought on yields and pastures, some acres that would normally have been harvested as grain were instead harvested as silage, particularly in the larger drought impacted livestock-producing states. On the demand side, domestic use was trimmed by 35 million bushels from December, while exports were cut by 150 million bushels. The net result was a 15 million bushel drop in expected ending stocks to 1.24 billion bushels for the 2022/23 marketing year. If realized, this will be the lowest ending stocks since 2013/14 and would put stock levels, relative to use, at 8.9%, also historically low compared to most years. The forecast for tight supply and low stocks-to-use ratio remains. On the global scale, The January WASDE shows foreign corn production also forecast lower than the December forecast, with hot and dry weather in South America leading to cuts in Argentina and Brazil production over the past month. Despite those cuts, 2022/23 corn production in both nations is forecast higher than 2021/22 bringing continued strong competition in the world export market.",

    "content": "As President Biden wraps up meetings with his counterparts in Mexico and Canada, NCGA is praising a key administration official for taking a tough stand on the trade impasse and encouraging quick action to resolve the issue. Secretary Tom Vilsack indicated on Monday that there would be no compromise on Mexico’s proposal to ban biotech corn. The secretary’s statement came as Biden met with Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. The National Corn Growers Association weighed in on the developments. “We appreciate Secretary Vilsack for taking a firm stand on this issue,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “We would encourage the Biden administration to keep this issue front and center and push for a quick resolution, as farmers have already made their purchasing decisions for the 2023 crop year. We also continue to urge the Biden administration to file a dispute under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.” Talks between the two countries started in the fall of last year, as NCGA and state corn grower groups encouraged the Biden administration to act to prevent López Obrador from moving forward with a promise to ban shipments of biotech corn beginning in early 2024. In December, Haag, along with the presidents of 23 state corn grower groups, sent a letter to President Biden calling for him to take additional steps to address the pending decree by Mexico that would block imports of biotech corn. Mexico is a major purchaser of U.S. corn, and 90 percent of corn grown in this country is biotech corn. NCGA has argued that the decree is a violation of USMCA.",

    "title": "NCGA President to EPA: Biofuels Can Contribute More to Lower Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Reduce Fuel Prices and Improve Energy Security",
    "content": "In the face of high fuel prices and global uncertainties, expanding access to renewable fuels may be even more relevant today than it was almost two decades ago when the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was enacted, the president of the National Corn Growers Association told the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today. His comments came during an EPA public hearing on the proposed RFS volume rule for 2023-2025. “We support the growth trajectory in EPA’s proposal; however, with continued pressure on energy security and costs and the need to accelerate carbon emission reductions, biofuels can contribute even more,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “We ask EPA to continue working with us on complementary policies that advance higher ethanol blends, enabling ethanol to do more to cut both emissions and costs.” Haag said corn growers also urge EPA to simply adopt the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Lab GREET model for lifecycle GHG assessment to most accurately account for the GHG emission reductions from biofuels like ethanol and the RFS. Today’s ethanol cuts GHG emissions by 50 percent compared to gasoline. “EPA acknowledges that its 2010 modeling framework is old and requires updating,” he noted. “Yet instead of adopting the federal government’s most robust and updated analysis, EPA included outdated estimates and proposed more reviews.” In addition, he said corn grower leaders continue to review EPA’s proposal for generating RFS credits from biomass electricity to ensure consistency with RFS crediting for other energy sources. “Corn growers are proud to supply low carbon feedstocks for low-cost, low-emission ethanol,” said Haag. “We stand ready to work with EPA to build on the growing biofuel volumes proposed to continue to make the RFS an energy, environmental and economic success.” Read Testimony",

The rule was released as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to decide a case, Sackett vs. EPA, which will provide more clarity on the issue. “We are disappointed that EPA moved ahead with its final rule when the Supreme Court will soon render a decision on this matter,” said National Corn Growers Association President Tom Haag. “The Court’s ruling could negate major elements of this WOTUS rule and will create even more uncertainty for farmers.” This year, NCGA submitted comments to EPA and encouraged corn growers to do the same as the rule was being considered. The group also participated in regional hearings held by EPA. NCGA has made it clear that farmers are committed to the objectives of the Clean Water Act and the protection of water quality around agricultural operations and downstream. But, the organization has argued, achieving these objectives does not require drainage and water features, which are distant from relatively permanent flowing tributaries, be made subject to EPA’s regulations. “As farmers, we are the ones who will feel the impact of this rule,” said Haag. “Yet, it appears that our comments fell on deaf ears.”",

    "title": "Review Commissioned by NCGA Confirms USDA is a Vital Source of Market Information for Corn Growers",
    "content": "Krista Swanson, the National Corn Growers Association’s lead economist, provides an analysis of a newly published independent study on the accuracy and market impact of USDA information on corn markets. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) collects survey data from farmers that is used as a basis for forecasts in several publicly published reports and databases. Agriculture economists, like me, frequently use USDA information in articles and studies that benefit farmers and our industry. In recent years growers have raised concerns about the complexity of the survey process, report accuracy and declining survey participation. The declining survey response rates have left USDA with a growing rate of insufficient data not only limiting what can be published, but also limiting ways data can be of value to farmers in return. As an example, when making the 2019/2020 farm program selection, farmers in counties with unpublished 2019 county survey yields, which would be very close to Agriculture Risk Coverage yields, were at a disadvantage in making an informed farm program decision. In this spiraling cycle, declining survey participation leads to insufficient data, while insufficient data leads to questions of accuracy and value that deter participation. To overcome the spiral, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) established a collaboration with USDA in 2016, by promoting grower participation in USDA surveys and improvements to enhance grower confidence in USDA reports. Continuing that endeavor, the Risk Management and Transportation Action Team of NCGA commissioned a newly published independent study to establish the state of knowledge regarding accuracy and market impact of USDA information on corn markets. The study led by Agriculture Economics Professors Olga Isengildina Massa (Virginia Tech), Berna Karali (University of Georgia), and Scott H. Irwin (University of Illinois), included a review of more than eighty academic reports dating back to 1970 and creation of a searchable public database of the reports and content. Addressing one of the biggest concerns about USDA reports, the authors conclude that USDA reports do cause market volatility, which is not a negative development as volatility does not equate to uncertainty. In fact, the review also shows USDA reports help decrease market uncertainty, which is only possible if USDA information is accurate and reliable. The authors also find strong evidence that market participants find USDA to be a reliable, objective source and a difficult source of information to beat. There is always room for improvement, such as the authors suggestion for expanded communication. But overall, the review confirms USDA as a vital and trustworthy source of market information for corn. As a daily user of USDA data, that’s significant validation I value. In addition to the revolving series of surveys USDA completes throughout each year, we are in the midst of the USDA Census of Agriculture survey that is only completed once every five years. When receiving such surveys, I encourage farmers to remember the value of the data to NCGA and our members is increased when USDA has adequate grower participation.

Aflatoxin can cost corn growers between $52.1 million to $1.68 billion in annual losses, according to a 2016 study. The development was praised by state corn grower leaders. “For years, the Aflatoxin Mitigation Center of Excellence has provided funding to projects focused the mitigation and amelioration of aflatoxin in corn,” said Texas Corn Producers Executive Director David Gibson. “Having Congress recognize the severity of this issue by providing additional funding through the Agricultural Research Service via appropriations is a tremendous step forward in our efforts.” The funding bill also continues ad hoc programs that aid farmers reeling from adverse weather conditions. It includes $3.74 billion to extend the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Emergency Relief Program to assist producers who suffered losses due to natural disasters in 2022, including drought. Also included in the package was an agreement between House and Senate leaders on the Growing Climate Solutions Act and the SUSTAINS Act. The Growing Climate Solutions Act directs USDA to establish a program to register entities that provide technical assistance and verification for farmers, ranchers and foresters who participate in voluntary carbon markets with the goal of providing information and confidence to producers. The SUSTAINS Act would allow corporations and other private entities to contribute funding for conservation projects and authorizes USDA to match the donations. The new law also includes two important pesticide provisions. It reauthorizes the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2022, which includes an increase in registration and maintenance fees to support a more predictable regulatory process and provides important resources for farmworker safety and health care provider training, in addition to other services that advance the safe and effective use of pesticides. Additionally, it requires EPA to comply with numerous registration process improvements to access additional funding levels and requires manufacturers to phase-in bilingual labels on pesticides products over the next 8 years. The legislation extends the deadline for EPA to complete registration review decisions. EPA is facing a significant backlog of pesticide registrations due to a variety of factors over the past several years, which has potential implications for continued access to numerous crop protection tools. The agency will be allowed to continue its registration review work through October 1, 2026, as a result of this extension. President Biden is expected to sign the legislation later today.",

    "title": "NCGA CEO Set to Depart Organization at Years End",
    "content": "Jon Doggett, a forceful and highly successful advocate for agriculture during his 35-year career as a lobbyist and chief executive, is preparing to depart the National Corn Growers Association at the end of the month. While Doggett has said it’s not a retirement, he has indicated he will use his free time to explore some of his passions, including spending more time with his grandchildren and kayaking. Those who have worked closely with Doggett say his legacy will live on in the nation’s capital. “Anyone who knows anything about agriculture and Washington knows that Jon is one of the best lobbyists and leaders in the city,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “He has left his mark through tremendous policy accomplishments, such as the passage of the Renewable Fuels Standard and through his mentorship of up-and-coming lobbyists and leaders in Washington.” Doggett began his career in 1987 as a legislative aide to the late Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Mont.). After an 11-year stint at the American Farm Bureau Federation, Doggett came to NCGA in 2002 as a vice president of public policy. He would later take the helm of the organization, beginning his tenure as CEO in 2018. The Washington he leaves is very different than the one he entered in the 80s. While the three-martini lunch was long gone at the time, vestiges of the Mad Men era lived on. Offices were still male-dominated, minorities and women rarely held positions of political power and business etiquette still resembled aspects of the 60s. For example, people smoked cigarettes openly in their offices, something unheard of today. Doggett spent his career working to change much of that culture, throwing his support behind up-and-coming female professionals and working to create an office culture that was friendly to groups that had historically faced discrimination. “Jon didn’t just push his staff to be better; he pushed NCGA to be better,” said former NCGA staffer Lesly Weber McNitt, who is now senior staff for the U.S. House Agriculture Committee. “He fought for a better maternity leave policy, and I was the first employee to benefit from the improved maternity leave policy when I had my daughter. As a result, I was a better mom and a better employee.” Those working with Doggett say he is as smart as he is blunt. “Jon is effective because he is an excellent visionary and tactician,” said Haag. “He also isn’t afraid to tell you what he thinks. You don’t have to worry about groupthink when Jon’s in the room.” Staffers have noted that Doggett is known for keeping a coffee cup on his desks that reads: “I could agree with you, but then we would both be wrong.” The agricultural community has benefitted from his direct style. For example, when tariffs were placed on fertilizer imports in 2021 at the behest of two major fertilizer companies, Doggett wrote a scathing op-ed taking fertilizer executives to task for their actions. Publication of the op-ed marked a turning point in the debate on the issue and was a topic of discussion amongst top executives at the fertilizer companies. He has spent the majority of his career fighting tooth and nail for ethanol. This year, an op-ed by Doggett touting the benefits of ethanol was published on the Fox Business website. In the piece, Doggett highlighted how important ethanol is to America’s energy security. Doggett was one of the first people to hear from Secretary Vilsack after the USDA leader traveled to Mexico City in late November to meet with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador over a promised decree to end imports of biotech corn. The trip, which was widely applauded by the agricultural community, came after NCGA had called on the Biden administration to act. “Jon gets things done because he knows people and understands how Washington works,” said Haag. “There will never be another Jon Doggett.” The search for a new NCGA CEO is underway.",

    "content": "With roots in farm country, one Congressional freshman says she wants to find common ground in Washington. When she is sworn in on January 3, 2023, Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski will be tasked with representing the interests of farmers in a vast swath of the state, all the way from Champaign to Springfield to just north of St. Louis. It’s the heart of corn country, and she knows that agriculture will factor heavily in many of the issues she will have to address in Washington. But Budzinski, a Democrat, also represents an evenly-divided constituency that previously elected a Republican to the seat. And she recognizes that it’s more important than ever to build bridges, find common ground and strive toward bipartisanship in the Capitol. In this episode, we ask the newly-elected Congresswoman what she sees as the biggest issues that growers face today, how she’s planning to go to bat for America’s farmers, and what it’s like going to a place like Washington as a Congressional freshman. Direct Share Link: https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ncga?selected=PDM2987758403PDM2987758403 TRANSCRIPT: Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski: One of the things I heard consistently I think throughout the campaign were people were looking for fresh ideas. I consider myself a bipartisan member-elect, someone that's looking for opportunities to work across the aisle on issues again that support the families and the communities in my district. I very much believe that is the charge that the voters gave me in the 13th Congressional District. Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to The Cobcast, inside the grind with The National Corn Growers Association. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the field, to the corn belt, to the DC beltway, we're making sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. So make sure you're following the show on your favorite podcast app, and sign up for The National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. In this episode, we'll meet a newly elected member of Congress from the heart of corn country, Illinois representative-elect Nikki Budzinski. We'll ask her what she sees as the biggest issues that growers face today, how she's planning to go to bat for America's farmers, and what it's like going to a place like Washington as a Congressional freshman. I'm Dusty Weis, along with NCGA vice-president to public policy, Brooke Appleton. Brooke, you're someone who's spent more than 16 years in the intersection between Washington DC and agriculture. Since we're asking the Congresswoman-elect the same question, what do you remember about your freshman experience in DC as a legislative assistant? Brooke Appleton: Thank you, Dusty, for that question. I definitely do remember. It was actually my first job right out of college was coming to Washington, and it was an internship that turned into a full-time job. But I remember my internship was in the Capitol, actually, so my first day literally walking up into the Capitol building as a fresh-faced 22, 23-year-old from Missouri was quite an experience. And I will say something particularly interesting about a new Congress and that feeling of a fresh start, new members, everyone's moving around all the offices. There's stuff in the hallways. It's busy. It's crazy. It's always a good time and a lot of anticipation in the air about: What is this new Congress going to be? And how's it going to feel? And what's going to get accomplished in the next couple of years? So I have to assume that's kind of what's going on up there right now. And I know folks are getting excited and gearing up, and I know we're preparing, as everyone across town is, on kind of what January 3rd and beyond is going to bring. So it's no secret that Washington can prove challenging at times. Being a member of the House of Representatives is no easy task. You're representing over 750,000 constituents with competing interests and having to raise a lot of dollars to be sure you can hold onto that. It's not a position that many of us envy. And it's not for everyone. But we're so fortunate that there are people who are willing and great leaders who are willing to step up to the plate and make sacrifices to guide this country, so we're joined by one of those willing leaders today. We're so fortunate to have with us Congresswoman-elect Nikki Budzinski from Illinois' 13th Congressional District. This district grows a lot of corn and is especially important to NCGA's efforts in Washington. We're looking forward to hearing from you about your decision to run for office, what you've learned from the campaign experience, and what opportunities and challenges you see as you enter the halls of Congress officially for the first time here in January. So Congresswoman-elect, thanks so much for taking the time to be with us today. Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski: It's great to be with you, Brooke, and it's great to be with you too, Dusty. I love the opportunity to be on The Cobcast. It's great to be with all of you. Thank you for having me. Brooke Appleton: As I mentioned, being a member of Congress is pretty tough and it's a thankless job for sure. Can you kind of take us through your decision-making process as you considered running for Congress, and how you kind of ended up here? Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski: Sure. Well, first I want to say it's an incredible honor to get elected to the 13th Congressional District, and representing families throughout Central and Southern Illinois, and also knowing that agriculture is incredibly important to this district. My background though is really in public service. I also worked in the labor movement. A part of my decision to decide to step forward to run to represent this great district was my background really in the labor movement. I talked a lot on the campaign trail about how I'm one of the few Congressional candidates at that time, probably now one of the few member-elects that's been on multiple kill floors. When I worked for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, they represent largely meatpacking workers, also retail workers. So I've really been on the front lines of a lot of really critical issues that are still being debated today, paid sick leave, raising the minimum wage, making sure that there are safe working conditions for working families. It really though, that was my background that's a lot of my passion that I bring to some of the issues that I'd love to work on in Congress, but also, the opportunities I've had to be in public service. I had the opportunity to work as a senior advisor to our governor in Illinois, Governor Pritzker. One of the things I talked a lot about again on the campaign trail, I chaired his broadband advisory council. And one of the things that I thought was really important in that experience was it taught me the importance of working together. The farm bureau was on our broadband advisory council, so were Democratic and Republican legislators. And we came together in the state of Illinois when there was a historic investment in high-speed internet access, this was actually pre-COVID, to make about a $400 million investment in high-speed internet access across the state of Illinois. We came together as a council with different opinions on the topic to put together a strategic vision for what that plan looked like so that we could deliver high-speed internet access to families and small businesses throughout the state of Illinois. That type of experience is also something that I think led me to making this decision to run for public office. I think it's something that we desperately need more of, is coming together, collaboration, finding opportunities to work together on issues that impact all communities and support families and small businesses. And so that collective experience I think working on issues that help working people, but also collaborative efforts like the broadband advisory council. And I'd also just highlight as well, the last position that I had before taking on this challenge of running for Congress was I did serve in the Biden administration. I was the chief of staff for the Office of Management and Budget. And one of the things that I helped to set up when I was there as well was the made in America office. I heard a lot about the struggles with the supply chain, US Steel, ADM, those are important businesses and entities that are located within the 13th Congressional District. Manufacturing is critically important. So having a front-row seat to helping to set that up at the federal level also helped to inspire me to run. So really, I can't point to, Brooke, one in particular thing. It's really kind of my collective experience in my career that led me to make this decision. Dusty Weis: Well, and if I may, Congresswoman-elect Budzinski, just heap one more potential motivating factor in there, there's something of a youth movement underway in Congress right now. The 117th Congress, which is finishing up its term, was on average the oldest group of representatives out of the last 20 years. The average age of senators in this Congress is about 64. The average age of a House member is 58.3. So as we transition to the 118th Congress, in the House, we saw Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership voluntarily step down to pave the way for a new generation of leaders. There are a number of new office holders like you, who are gen Xers or even millennials. And having now run a successful campaign for Congress, what would you say are some of the factors that have contributed to that age disparity in Congress? And was it an uphill battle for you to run against that? Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski: Well, I think one of the things I heard consistently I think throughout the campaign were, people were looking for fresh ideas and new approaches to government. I think again, I want to underscore the importance that I think there is in collaboration, finding common ground. I consider myself a bipartisan member-elect, someone that's looking for opportunities to work across the aisle on issues again that support the families and the communities in my district. I very much believe that is the charge that the voters gave me in the 13th Congressional District. They want me to not go to Congress to be a part of the political noise, but to be a part of results and getting things done, and expect that I will work across the aisle and across party ideologies to be able to get those things done. I think one of the things that is exciting is I think that people are looking for a new Congress to reflect the mosaic, I guess if you will, of the American electorate. And I think you've underscored what has happened, Dusty. In the election results, you have gen Xers like myself, but also younger people, the millennials, generation Z. We helped to elect in the Democratic caucus our first African American leader to lead our House caucus with Hakeem Jeffries. So I think there are new approaches, new ideas, new people coming in, and that's good for government. I think that's good for finding new solutions for an ever-changing political world. And so I'm really proud and honored to get to be a part of that. Brooke Appleton: And you mentioned your campaign experience a few times. And we all know there's no doubt that campaigning is extremely difficult work, learning about issues important to votes that you might not have had direct experience with prior, and constantly moving around in a rather large district to maximize your time and get in front of as many voters as possible. What did you learn from the constituents of the 13th District? And you've mentioned that a little bit about solutions and being bipartisan. But what surprised you the most from your experience on the campaign trail? Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski: I think I'd say that consistently, whether I was in Democratic or Republican audiences, that it is people wanting to see me go to Congress to get things done. I will just anecdotally say during my campaign, I was actually stopped by some Republicans. One gentleman that lives in my neighborhood that rides a bike, I see him in the park when I walk my dog, he stopped me to just say, \"I'm a Republican. I'm voting for you. You're a Democrat. But I'm voting for you because want to see someone go to Congress to get some things done.\" And he would acknowledge, he and I would not agree necessarily on all of the same issues. But on some of the fundamentals like infrastructure investments, I think there are some things democracy was something that was underwriting the entire election, believing in good government, not that government is the solution to everything because it's not, but to finding the areas where maybe we can agree and across party line. Another thing, I was really honored on election night. Our former Republican governor, Governor Jim Edgar actually attended my election night party, and I was incredibly honored. I've developed a great relationship with him because of a program he actually started at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign called the Edgar Fellows Program. And the part of that program that really resonates, and the whole point really of the program is collaboration and finding opportunities to work together. It's a fellowship program at the University of Illinois that brings together Republican and Democratic legislative staff to really again find opportunities where we can learn from each other. That overwhelmingly was the message that I really heard that surprised me, and something that I didn't necessarily expect when I was campaigning for Congress, is that even in Democratic audiences or Republican audiences, they're expecting collaboration. I think we were able to make that point successfully during the campaign. And I think it's a learning experience. I spend a lot of time listening to voters and I'm going to be doing a lot more of that this week, actually. I'm spending time later in the district when we're going to be meeting with a variety of folks. I'm meeting with the president of University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. I'm meeting with some faith leaders. I'm meeting with labor leaders. We're doing a listening tour throughout the district to really kind of hear again from voters what they'd like to charge me with when I get to Congress and I'm sworn in on January 3rd. So did a lot of listening during the campaign. Collaboration I would say was the overwhelming theme that I heard throughout that I might not have expected. And that's really what I feel like I'll be doing once sworn in. Dusty Weis: You had mentioned a little while ago the important, particularly of that consensus building and collaboration when it comes to issues of infrastructure. You served as chair of Illinois Broadband Advisory Council. And broadband access is an issue that affects rural areas as much as it affects urban areas. So what did you take away from that experience that you can now use to advocate for your constituents in Washington and on a national level with that issue? Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski: Well, one of the things I think that's so important about this issue, and it continues to be, after the last three years of COVID, if we doubted the importance of being connected, that should really be made very crystal clear for students, for farmers, for small business owners, for community, small businesses throughout the 13th Congressional District. I think that before I took on that issue, I thought it was perhaps just a rural issue. It's actually urban and rural. People struggle with connectivity. What we were able to do in Illinois, as I mentioned, was a historic investment as a part of a larger bill that we did in Illinois called Rebuild Illinois. It was our largest infrastructure bill in the state's history. In there was a lot of horizontal and vertical infrastructure improvements, which were needed in the state. But also, that was where the broadband investment was, over $400 million over five years. And so creating a process with which how are we going to look at having a results-driven process that had all of the key stakeholders, again, Democrat, Republican, the Farm Bureau was at our table, we had the telecom industry at the table to collaboratively look at the issue and say, \"What do we want out of this investment beyond just connectivity?\" We realized at that time that for broadband in Illinois, there had been a lot of investment in middle mile investment, but not last mile. And the last mile actually ends up being kind of some of the most cost prohibitive. So we wanted to prioritize making sure that we were making that final connect in the areas that weren't connected. But we looked also at bigger goals. And one of the things that actually I'd be very interested in continuing to pursue in Congress is telehealth. That's incredibly important I think in rural communities, urban communities, places where there aren't specialty care, and providing access to healthcare through telehealth. That is not possible without making sure that you have the connectivity and the speed rate that you need in order to connect a doctor with their patient. And so I think we saw that as well during COVID. I know in the state of Illinois and at the federal level, there were real expansions of telehealth efforts, but that was really only going to be possible for communities that had again the access to the broadband needs that were required. I think that telehealth is a really important thing to making sure that rural communities have again, access to specialty care when we're looking at: How are we going to tackle substance abuse and substance abuse treatment? How are we going to tackle mental health needs? I think that telehealth could be an important solution to those issues. But again, broadband was the undergirding investment that made that possible. And so when I worked on the Broadband Advisory Council, that was one of the outcomes. We became focused on: What were the outcomes we were looking for? That was one of kind of the guiding principles to where we wanted to see investment. And then basically, after we had a framework collectively, we established the Connect Illinois office, which is the office of broadband that is now housed within the office of the governor. And there was a person hired to lead that effort, and executive director. And then we put out notice for funding. And that has gone very well over the last several years. There have been millions of dollars that have been distributed throughout the state of Illinois. The thing that is also I think exciting with my experience at the state level is: How do you partner that and marry it with resources and funding at the federal level? As you know, Dusty and Brooke, they passed at the federal level a very large bipartisan infrastructure package. As a part of that federal package, there were critical investments in broadband in that bill as well. So I think part of the job that I have is looking at the investments that are being made at the state level and the federal level. Where are the priorities for the communities of Central and Southern Illinois? How do you marry the two? How do you partner with local and state leaders to making sure we're getting the most out of our taxpayer dollars? I think that's incredibly important. And so I think it's maximizing those resources. So I learned a lot from that experience with broadband that I think will be very informative and helpful as I look to serving in Congress. I do think again, one of the things that's unique about the 13th Congressional District, if I could describe it just briefly, it does go to the farthest eastern end of the University of Illinois. I live in Springfield, which is dead center in the state of Illinois, and then it drops down to just outside of St. Louis. The two counties, Madison and St. Clair County are really suburban St. Louis counties on the Illinois side of the river. But we do have the Mississippi River right up against the 13th. So investments that are infrastructure investments that go well beyond broadband are going to be critical to this district as well. Locks and dams investment, there's flooding that happens now pretty regularly in the southern western part of this district. How are we investing in flood mitigation efforts to make sure that we're protecting those farmers that are being impacted clearly by historic rain that we're seeing in this area? And so I think those are kind of some of the infrastructure investments that I'm going to be looking to work on. But also, I wanted to say agriculture is something that is going to be incredibly important. As you know in Illinois, the agrarian economy is one of our biggest economic drivers in the entire state of Illinois. The 13th Congressional District is no different. It is made up of a lot of rural communities, very strong agricultural base. I think looking at opportunities again, like the broadband example I've made is: How are we working together to address some of the issues, expanding bio fuels, making sure that farmers have in these communities the investments infrastructure to support an agrarian economy that we have in this area? So those are the kind of experiences and what I'll be looking to be working on in Congress. Brooke Appleton: And we've talked a lot about already bipartisanship and the importance of bipartisanship and collaborating, which is so refreshing to hear, and I know something that we really put a lot of weight in at the National Corn Growers Association. So congratulations on you having been elected the freshman representative to the New Democrat Coalition. We work with many members of this moderate caucus on issues of importance to our membership from trade, transportation, taxes, you kind of name it, issues important to our membership. So again, we've talked a lot about bipartisanship. And we've talked a lot about it in previous podcasts that we've had. And we appreciate that's still a challenge here in Washington, and kind of cutting through the noise of what is perceived as and can be a very partisan environment and a very challenging environment. Do you want to maybe shed a little light on how you plan to approach that as you make your way into the new Congress as a freshman? Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski: So when I, as a candidate, I came across the New Democratic Coalition, the reason I really liked them, I immediately loved that they were about public policy. They are a coalition of elected leaders that believe that perfect shouldn't be the enemy of the good, that we can be collaborative and bipartisan. So I think that those are really important attributes to finding real solutions and delivering for the communities in this district. And so I've been excited since the November 8th election to actually have the chance to participate in three different new member orientations. Many of them have been bipartisan, have had bipartisan elements to them. And there have been great opportunities to meet with obviously new colleagues on the Democratic side, but also on the Republican side, meeting some of my newer colleagues as well. And I think that the thing that's been so interesting as a part of these new member orientations is how much they underscore the importance of relationships. When we're talking about how we can be bipartisan, how we can work together, we have to build trust. We've got to build relationships. And they will say that really has started for a lot of members at their new member orientation, taking time to have a cup of coffee or visit with someone that is not of your same political party, but is somebody that you could maybe find some common ground with. I'd use as an example, I just recently got back from Harvard. Harvard hosts a new member orientation, which is really fascinating, they bring in a lot of academics, but also current members of Congress to give you pro tips on what to be looking for after January 3rd. I had the opportunity to meet with Zach Nunn. Zach Nunn is a congressman-elect that's going to be representing Des Moines. I too represent a state capital in Springfield, and so Zach and I got to talking about some of the similarities between our districts. And he'd offered and invited me to join him for his state fair next summer. And I thought that was a great opportunity. I said, \"Of course,\" and I said, \"I hope you'll come and visit my state fair, which is also in August.\" I'd also say the Farm Progress Show is something. Decatur is in my district. Decatur hosts and switches with Iowa off and on, off year, the Farm Progress Show. And so I think that there are opportunities like that, and talking to Zach, in particular about agriculture, that I think that we're going to find a lot of issues where we're going to be able to work together to support our communities. It was really important to me that there are seven counties in the 13th Congressional District. All seven of them I will share with a Republican member of Congress. Six of them, I will share with Congresswoman Mary Miller, who's on the House Agriculture Committee, the seventh I will share with Congressman Mike Bost, who is very likely to be in line to be the chair of the Veteran's Affairs Committee. I've reached out and sat down with both of them, including outgoing Congressman Rodney Davis, who's been representing the 13th District now for 10 years, just to get advice, to ask for ideas, what's important to them. Congresswoman Mary Miller in particular serves on the House Ag Committee. As I said, there's a Farm Bill next year. I have made it pretty well known that I'm hoping that I can serve on the House Agriculture Committee. I think if I did have that opportunity, I'm not hiding from the fact that we might disagree. Congresswoman Miller and I will disagree on a lot of issues. But maybe in the agriculture space, there could be an issue or two where we can work together, and I think that's really important. So trying to find those areas where maybe we can find some common ground, I think the Farm Bill in particular is a place where we can potentially do that. Brooke Appleton: I think you make a really good point, and the Agriculture Committee seems to be one of the few places left in Washington where it's really less about Republicans and Democrats. The issues that we face in agriculture tend to be regional. So it's really just kind of about what part of the country you're in, and not so much what party you're in. So we do find a lot of bipartisanship, so it's really good to hear that you already kind of started those conversations with your fellow Illinois members. And I will say, as someone who works for the National Corn Growers Association, hearing collaboration with an Iowan and an Illinois member is already good news to me, as those are two pretty big corn-growing states that we obviously have really active state associations in. So that's good to hear, and our membership will be happy to hear that as well. Dusty Weis: Bridging that Mississippi River, that's an important task, certainly. And you mentioned the importance of collaborating on the Farm Bill, also veterans' issues being two issues that are important in farm country. But we all know that from the perspective of someone who's out in these corn fields every day. What happens in Washington, what happens in politics can still seem very far away from life on the farm. But with everything that's happened in the last year, you've got Russia's attack on Ukraine, the disruption to global food supplies that resulted, supply chain issues. Do you think the impact that we've felt on the farm from those events has sort of changed the way that growers look at Washington? Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski: Absolutely. Input prices is something that I heard consistently throughout the campaign. I think that it is something that we're going to need to be able to tackle in this next Farm Bill. As I mentioned, I think the issues around our supply chain are still very much felt. I talked a lot about making things here again. I think we need to be prioritizing American business, American workers, helping to relieve the supply chain pressures because a lot of the supply chain pressures have really been what has exacerbated our issues around inflation. So when we want to talk about how we're going to address input prices, I think it's really getting to the heart of our supply chain issues. And how are we going to address those? Getting back to the Farm Bill, I think it's incredibly important. I think how we're addressing those issues around the supply chain, are there opportunities for us to do that in the Farm Bill potentially? I think we need to make sure there's a strong safety net for our family farmers within this Farm Bill as well, so that when we do see these pressures around a supply chain, input prices that are not going away, fuel prices, what are we doing to support them? I think we have opportunities to show our support in this Farm Bill. It's why I've always been a very consistent supporter of crop insurance. I think that's very important. I think we need to be promoting voluntary incentives for climate smart agriculture. I think that's something I will be looking to finding opportunities to incentivize within our Farm Bill and maintaining our strong nutrition programs, obviously, will also be very important. But I think the Farm Bill, again Dusty, I think it presents this real great opportunity for us next year to help provide relief to family farmers and address some of these really big issues. Brooke Appleton: I know we've talked about this a little bit already, about kind of what you're looking forward to as you make your way into this new Congress. But what do you kind of see as your biggest challenge ahead for your first year here in Congress? And I guess what are you most looking forward to? Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski: I think that what I'm most looking forward to is getting down to the work of it. I'm excited to find out what committees I'm going to end up being on. As I mentioned, the House Agriculture Committee is my top priority. I've also mentioned I'm very interested in transportation and infrastructure. I'm also very interested in the Veterans' Committee. So I think first and foremost is kind of finding out how that shakes out, what committees I'm going to serve on. Been working really hard to build out a really strong team, so that we are ready to hit the ground running. We'll have offices opened on day one. I participated, as I'm sure you all have heard about the freshman lottery for our office selection, which is this kind of funny cross between the NFL draft and the Hunger Games all at one time. So I ended up with an office in Longworth on the first floor. I'm very excited about that. Dusty Weis: That's good real estate. Yeah. Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski: Yeah, that's a good spot. So I think first and foremost is making sure that we're operational. Constituency service is incredibly important. I've hired my in district director. I have a chief of staff. I think getting those folks in place is really critical. But I am really looking forward to the policy. I do think that again, the Farm Bill is one of the few things that I know is a must pass, even in a narrowly divided Congress, so could potentially one of the few things that we see for sure is going to be able to get done in these next two years. So being a part of that, I've had the opportunity when I served in the governor's administration to work on some really large omnibus bills, whether it's gaming or infrastructure. As a legislator, you learn a lot from those experiences. I have no doubt I'll learn a lot from being a part of this Farm Bill and advocating for family farmers in the communities in this district, so I'm looking forward to that work. Dusty Weis: Representative-elect, when you talk to members of Congress, and I know that you have talked to a lot by this stage, but they'll tell you that two years goes by in the blink of an eye. And so two years from now, when you're looking back on your first term in office, maybe deciding whether or not you want to pursue a second, how do you think your perceptions of the job, your perceptions of Congress, of Washington, will have changed or evolved for you over that first term? Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski: I think that right now, as I mentioned, if I could be a part of again this Farm Bill that I think is going to come up in these next two years, I think that is going to be a very big teaching moment for me, and instructive and kind of moving forward. I think it's going to be interesting to see in a very narrowly again divided Congress, kind of the areas where we are going to be able to work together, certainly even well beyond the Farm Bill. One of the reasons why I have mentioned that I'm interested in transportation and infrastructure is the implementation of the Federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill is going to be happening while I'm here in my first term. And so I think just being a part of making sure that we're able to capture as much of those resources as we possibly can for the families in Central and Southern Illinois, and hopefully being a part of that discussion I think is going to be really important. And so I'd highlight those two areas as the things that I'm really going to be the most focused on, and interested in looking back on in these next two years as being a part of. And so yeah, I look forward to that work and see where we land. Brooke Appleton: Well, Congresswoman-elect, we wish you all the very best as you enter this next phase. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the wonderful relationship we had and we enjoyed with retiring Congresswoman Cheri Bustos, and outgoing member Rodney Davis. They were both champions of agriculture and biofuels policy. We really hope to kind of just continue that as you enter into the 13th District of Illinois. We very much look forward to working closely with you and advocating for corn growers across the country. So thank you so much for your time today. We really appreciate you coming on here and giving us your perspective. Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski: Yeah. Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it, and I look forward to partnering with the corn growers and Congress. Dusty Weis: Congresswoman-Elect Nikki Budzinski from the great state of Illinois, thank you so much for sharing your perspective with us. And Brooke Appleton, NCGA vice-president of public policy, thank you for lending your expertise to the conversation as well. I'm Dusty Weis for The National Corn Growers Association.

    "title": "Corn Grower Leaders from Across the Country Call on Biden to Set Quick, Firm Timeline While Pressing Case on Biotech Corn with Mexico",
    "content": "The presidents of 23 state corn grower groups, joined by the president of the National Corn Growers Association, sent a letter to President Biden today calling for him to take additional steps to address the pending decree by Mexico that would block imports of biotech corn. The letter encouraged the president to raise the issue during upcoming trade talks and to file a dispute under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement if Mexico doesn’t act expeditiously to withdraw the decree. “Corn farmers are right now in the process of making planting decisions for next spring, and any additional uncertainty in the market affects their ability to appropriately respond to multiple market signals,” the corn grower leaders said. “If the decree is not completely withdrawn by the established deadline, we ask that your administration initiate a case under USMCA.” The letter is in response to a promise by President López Obrador to end imports of biotech corn beginning in early 2024. Ninety percent of corn grown in the U.S. is biotech corn. Mexico’s Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard plans to visit Washington this week to discuss the issue ahead of a planned meeting on trade between Biden, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early January. The state corn grower leaders urged Biden to raise the issue at the meeting. “Because the stakes for farmers and rural America are so high, we are calling on you to make this issue a critical part of your January 9th meeting with President López Obrador and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,” the letter says. The letter also detailed specific actions the president could take in the coming days. “We are also asking that you empower Ambassador Katherine Tai to work with Secretary Vilsack to set a firm, quick timeline with Mexico to withdraw the decree or initiate a case under the biotechnology provisions of the U.S-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA), and that you do so without agreeing to a ban of any form of biotech corn, including white corn that is used for human consumption,” the group noted. The letter also emphasized the science supporting the safe use of biotech corn. “Decades of science show that biotech corn is safe for use,” the letter says. “Growers plant biotech corn, which is reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and regulatory agencies around the world, because it saves money, reduces the use of insecticides and lowers carbon emissions. This technology also allows corn growers to plant seeds that are resistant to severe weather conditions caused by climate change.” The letter notes that the ban would have an impact on the Mexican people, noting a recently released study showing that it could lead to increased food insecurity in the country – especially among the working class – for whom corn is a major staple. U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack traveled to Mexico City in late November to meet with President López Obrador about the issue, a development that was widely praised by corn growers. Vilsack emphasized during that meeting that minus a reasonable agreement, the U.S. would take action, including filing a complaint under USMCA. Corn growers have since pushed the administration for faster action.",

    "content": "U.S. farmers not only planted and harvested a large crop successfully in 2022, but they also rolled out some impressive yields in the National Corn Growers Association’s (NCGA) National Corn Yield Contest despite an array of weather challenges. The National Corn Yield Contest is now in its 58th year and remains NCGA’s most popular program for members. “Corn plays an incredibly important role in so many aspects of life in America and abroad,” said Lowell Neitzel, chair of NCGA’s Member and Consumer Engagement Action Team. “This contest offers a unique opportunity for all farmers to take part in the innovation and creativity that move our industry forward. Contest winners, at the national and state levels, find new ways to excel while using a variety of techniques. Ultimately, the data generated and insights found by farmers and input providers enable U.S. farmers to continue to meet the future demand for critical food, feed, fuel and fiber.” The 27 national winners in 9 production categories had verified yields averaging 340.7245 bushels per acre, compared to the projected national average of 172.3 bushels per acre nationwide. For more than half a century, NCGA’s National Corn Yield Contest has provided corn growers with the opportunity to compete with their colleagues to grow the most corn per acre, helping feed and fuel the world. This has given participants not only the recognition they deserved but the opportunity to learn from their peers. Please visit ncga.com/NCYC for the complete list of 2022 National and State winners.",

    "title": "USDA Lowers Expected Corn Exports and Raises Ending Stocks for 2022/23",
    "content": "The following is a brief analysis by Krista Swanson, the lead economist for the National Corn Growers Association. The United States Department of Agriculture released the December World Agricultural Supply & Demand Estimates (WASDE) report on Friday. Most United States grain and oilseeds estimates were unchanged from last month. Citing slow sales and shipments through early December and competition from other exporters, the USDA lowered corn exports for the 2022/23 marketing year by 75 million bushels resulting in an equivalent increase in projected ending stocks with no other changes on the corn balance sheet. To dig into USDA’s assessment of slow sales, here is a look at corn export sales so far this marketing year. With data through Week 14 of the marketing year, weekly exports for 2022/23 are represented by the solid blue line. Exports to date in this year are notably trailing last year and the five-year average pace represented by the blue dashed and dotted lines. The export projection of 54.6 MMT in the November WASDE was very close to the 5-year average of 54.8 MMT, providing a good illustration of a pace to hit the export target. The lower projection of 52.71 MMT in the December WASDE is still beyond current pace, but this early in the marketing year there is time for a rebound in corn exports. Exports to China in 2022/23, represented by the solid red line, are ahead of last year and the previous five-year average as shown by the dashed and dotted red lines. China’s actions early in the week to lift COVD-19 restrictions may help bolster demand for corn and other commodities that use corn. The marketing-year average farm price was also lowered by ten cents to $6.70 per bushel, with no changes made to acreage or yield. Given the projected yield of 172.3 bushels per acres, the change translates to a $17.23 per acre decline in expected revenue for farmers.",

    "content": "Guest Contributor: Rachel Bush - Private Lands Conservation Programs Manager with Pheasants Forever, Inc. and Quail Forever The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) has partnered with Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever for the second year to help increase pollinator habitat on agricultural lands. Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever is a non-profit conservation organization with a 40-year history of working with private landowners to help them meet their on-farm habitat goals. With over 250 field staff providing technical assistance to farmers, ranchers, and other private landowners in 35 states, they are the experts in creating high-quality habitat. Creating high-quality pollinator habitat benefits more than just bees and butterflies. Many species of birds, including upland species like pheasants and quail, along with other wildlife species benefit from these areas, too. In addition, a well-planned pollinator habitat can increase biodiversity, sequester carbon, and reduce erosion which, in turn, leads to greater on-farm sustainability. We are encouraging NCGA members to reach out to their local Pheasants Forever staff here to get started on creating high-quality pollinator habitat on your farm. Along with technical assistance on where and what to plant, Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever staff will assist you in navigating cost-share and incentive-based programs to help you establish pollinator habitat.",

    "title": "Bipartisan Members of House Ways and Means Committee Call on USTR to Act on Trade Dispute with Mexico",
    "content": "Twenty-four members of the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee sent a letter today to Ambassador Katherine Tai, calling on her to act to resolve a lingering trade dispute with Mexico over biotech corn imports. Reps. Adrian Smith (R-Neb.) and Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) led the bipartisan effort. “We have been working closely with Congress on this issue, and it’s inspiring to see congressional champions from both parties faithfully taking up the mantle,” said National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) President Tom Haag. “These members of Congress are now looking to Ambassador Tai to uphold the integrity of USMCA.” The letter is the latest development and response from U.S. officials as the ag community braces for the fallout if President Andrés Manuel López Obrador follows through with a promise to ban biotech corn shipments beginning in early 2024. Ninety percent of U.S. corn is biotech corn. NCGA has been sounding the alarm on this issue for months. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack traveled to Mexico City last week to meet with President López Obrador. During the meeting, the secretary told the Mexican president that absent an acceptable resolution on the issue the U.S. would consider all options, including “taking formal steps to enforce our legal rights under the USMCA.” NCGA has been asking the Biden administration to set a timeline for negotiations and to move forward with a formal complaint under USMCA if the reasonable solution is not reached. In addition to Reps. Smith and Kildee, those singnging the letter included Reps. Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.), Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), Ron Estes (R-Kan.), Dwight Evans (D-Penn.), Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.), Kevin Hern (R-Okla.)

    "title": "NCGA Advocates for Corn Growers in Comments Submitted to USDA and IRS",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) recently filed two sets of comments to help shape implementation of key biofuel provisions from the Inflation Reduction Act IRA major legislation that was passed by Congress and signed into law earlier this year. One set of comments submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture addresses the IRA’s $500 million biofuels infrastructure program, and the other set of comments provides recommendations to the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service for their pending guidance for new tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel and clean fuel production, which will include ethanol. Both sets of comments highlighted the positive role farmers and ethanol play in saving drivers money and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. NCGA’s input for USDA’s biofuels infrastructure program was developed with feedback from state corn grower associations based on states’ on-the-ground experience with prior programs. NCGA President Tom Haag also noted corn growers’ investments in biofuels infrastructure and offered continued partnership with NCGA and state corn grower organizations to support the success of USDA’s biofuels infrastructure program. “NCGA and its affiliated state organizations have promoted USDA’s recent Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program, and corn growers have provided funding to support participants in the application process and cost-share assistance for applicants through our promotion programs,” Haag wrote in the input to USDA. “As such, NCGA and its state affiliates have a vested interest in the continued success of USDA’s biofuels infrastructure grant program and achieving positive outcomes with the $500 million provided in the Inflation Reduction Act. We look forward to partnering with USDA on this program.” In the comments to Treasury and the IRS, Haag encouraged the agencies to work with the U.S. Department of Energy and USDA to implement the new sustainable aviation fuel and clean fuel tax credits. Expertise and data from DOE and USDA will ensure an accurate and effective carbon performance standard that correctly captures and accounts for ongoing carbon emissions reductions in both corn feedstock and ethanol production, expanding agriculture’s clean energy contribution through new fuels like sustainable aviation fuel and clean liquid fuels like ethanol. Specifically, NCGA urged Treasury and IRS to use the best carbon lifecycle measurement within the federal government, DOE’s Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET model, for the sustainable aviation fuel tax credits, in addition to the requirement already in the law to use GREET for the clean fuel production credit. “(Farmers’) production practice improvements will further reduce the carbon intensity of sustainable aviation fuel and other clean fuels with lower-carbon feedstocks, but these and other carbon intensity reductions will not be properly accounted for without an updated and dynamic life cycle analysis, shortchanging sustainable aviation fuel innovation, new production and emission reductions,” said Haag in the comments to Treasury and IRS. “The climate programs and tax credits of the Inflation Reduction Act must work together to support clean energy innovation, reduce emissions, improve energy security, and grow rural economies.” NCGA will continue to provide input to federal agencies to ensure corn growers have a seat at the table when it comes to implementation of these new programs and tax incentives.",

    "title": "NCGA Applauds U.S. House Members for Introducing Bill Ensuring Consumer Access to E15",
    "content": "U.S. Representatives Angie Craig (D-Minn.) and Adrian Smith (R-Neb.), with the support of 21 bipartisan co-sponsors, introduced the Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2022, new legislation that would enable the year-round, nationwide sale of ethanol blends higher than 10%. The legislation would help lower fuel prices and improve stability and certainty in the U.S. fuel market. “We applaud Reps. Angie Craig and Adrian Smith, along with their bipartisan cosponsors, for introducing new legislation to keep higher ethanol blends accessible, saving consumer money at the pump and enhancing our energy security,” said Tom Haag, President of National Corn Growers Association (NCGA). “This bill provides a commonsense resolution to a long-standing outdated barrier to ensure drivers across the country continue to have year-round access to safe, low-cost, low-emission E15.” The new House legislation, H.R. 9455, is a companion to legislation introduced last week by Sens. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and 13 bipartisan Senate cosponsors. Yesterday, a broad coalition of more than 250 organizations and companies, including NCGA and 19 state corn grower associations, advocated for Congress to act on this issue this year to resolve ongoing uncertainty over full-market access for cleaner, low-cost fuel choices like E15, often marketed as Unleaded 88. Despite EPA approving E15 for use in all 2001 and newer vehicles and a 2019 update to regulations, a 2021 court decision would have ended year-round market access to E15 last summer without the Biden administration using emergency authority to keep E15 in the market. The administration’s temporary action increased the fuel supply and reduced fuel prices, but fuel choice is again in question for 2023. This new House and Senate legislation would provide a permanent remedy to the issue on a national basis, even as several Midwest governors have also initiated a state-by-state solution. Just this week, EPA submitted its draft response to the Office of Management and Budget for interagency review, signaling EPA’s intent to move forward with implementing the governors’ notices. “Following roadblocks and uncertainty on federal actions, governors took matters into their hands this year, and their initiative spurred renewed interest in a nationwide solution,” said Haag. “Corn growers support EPA implementing the governors’ notices for summer 2023, unless or until a national solution, like the one now introduced in the House and Senate, becomes law and resolves this issue once and for all.” Ensuring continued E15 sales year-round keeps a lower-emission fuel choice in the marketplace that costs less. E15 cuts evaporative, carbon and tailpipe emissions compared to standard 10 percent ethanol blended fuels. Blending more ethanol to make E15 displaces more toxic components in gasoline, reducing exhaust emissions for cleaner air.",

    "content": "ExoPolymer, Inc., a winner of the Consider Corn Challenge II, recently announced a new partnership with CP Kelco, which takes ExoPolymer’s technology one step closer to commercialization. The partnership with CP Kelco will help ExoPolymer scale up production of a polysaccharide-based biopolymer. ExoPolymer is creating a new profile of customizable, polysaccharide-based hydrocolloids that are domestically produced by microbial fermentation using corn sugar as a feedstock. These new hydrocolloids will meet the growing needs and performance gaps in the healthcare, personal care, food, pharmaceutical and energy industries. “We are thrilled to see one of our previous Consider Corn Challenge Winners, Derek Wells and ExoPolymer, continue to reach key milestones in becoming closer to commercialization,” said NCGA Director of Market Development Sarah McKay. “This is our hope for all of our winners and is the goal of the contest. We want to help bring to light some of the great research that’s happening out there using corn as an industrial feedstock, which in turn increases corn demand.” In addition to the assistance from the NCGA, ExoPolymer raised Seed funding from the Investment Group of Santa Barbara to help with early research for targeted markets. They also received funding from the USDA through a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant.

    "content": "This week, Secretary Tom Vilsack traveled to Mexico City to meet with Mexican Pres. Andrés Manuel López Obrador to discuss Mexico’s promise to block biotech corn imports beginning in 2024. During the meeting, Vilsack spoke of the importance of finding an acceptable resolution on the matter. Pres. López Obrador indicated this week that there might be room for compromise, suggesting the country could allow imports of yellow corn, used for livestock, while blocking white corn, which is imported mainly for human consumption. The idea that white corn is for food and yellow corn is for feed overlooks the fact that yellow corn is also food grade and a nutritious ingredient in hundreds of products consumers enjoy. From bakery products to chewing gum, aspirin to antibiotics, condiments to corn bread, yellow corn also feeds the world. In response to these developments, Tom Haag, President of the National Corn Growers Association released the following statement: “Any decision to block biotech crops by Mexico would be illegal under the U.S.-Mexico Agreement,” said Haag. “Eliminating white corn will in no way resolve this conflict. We are highly appreciative of Secretary Vilsack for going to the mat on this issue for U.S. farmers.”",

    "content": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today released proposed renewable fuel volume requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard for 2023, 2024 and 2025, proposing annual growth in volumes. The RFS requires annual volumes of renewable fuels, such as ethanol, be used in the fuel supply to reduce emissions, expand and diversify the fuel supply, improve energy security and lower costs. “We are pleased with EPA’s forward-looking approach of annual increases in the proposal,” said National Corn Growers Association President Tom Haag. “EPA clearly recognizes that renewable fuels like ethanol play a critical role in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, increasing U.S. energy independence and providing long-term relief to consumers at the pump. With continued pressure on energy security and costs and the need to accelerate carbon emission reductions, biofuels can contribute even more, and we will make that case to EPA for the final volumes.” For 2023, EPA’s proposal includes an implied 15 billion gallons for conventional ethanol, which increases to 15.25 billion gallons for both 2024 and 2025. EPA also followed through on proposing to restore the remaining 250 million gallons from a prior court decision for 2023. EPA did not propose a specific update for lifecycle GHG assessments of biofuels but instead will take further comment and review options for a future update. Such an update is overdue and necessary to accurately reflect the shrinking carbon footprint of today’s ethanol, and NCGA will continue urging EPA to adopt the Department of Energy’s data-driven assessment. The 2023-2025 proposal is EPA’s first RFS volume rule based on qualitative environmental, economic and agriculture factors listed in the statute, rather than specific volumes in law, which afforded EPA greater latitude in proposing these annual requirements within certain guardrails. As such, EPA builds on the strong baseline of the 2022 RFS volumes, which included the full statutory 15 billion gallons for ethanol, providing for future growth with this proposal. NCGA will submit detailed comments to EPA on the proposal, and EPA has agreed to finalize the RFS volumes by June 2023.",

    "content": "Sens. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and 13 bipartisan Senate cosponsors, introduced the Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act today, which would ensure permanent, full-market access to E15, often marketed as Unleaded 88. The National Corn Growers Association applauded the new legislation, which has drawn support from a wide range of agriculture, fuel and retail stakeholders as a new opportunity to address a persistent issue. “Ethanol saves Americans millions of dollars a year at the pump and is a critical part of our nation’s energy security,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “We thank Sens. Fischer and Klobuchar and their cosponsors for introducing legislation today that will ensure drivers across the country continue to have year-round access to safe, low-cost, low-emission E15 and provides a commonsense resolution to a long-standing outdated barrier to consumer choice.” Despite EPA approving E15 for use in all 2001 and newer vehicles and a 2019 update to regulations, a 2021 court decision would have ended year-round market access to E15 last summer without the Biden administration using emergency authority to keep E15 in the market. The administration’s temporary action increased the fuel supply and reduced fuel prices, but fuel choice is again in question for 2023. This legislation would provide a permanent remedy to the problem on a national basis, even as several Midwest governors have also initiated a state-by-state solution. “Following roadblocks and uncertainty on federal actions, governors took matters into their hands this year, and their initiative spurred renewed interest in a nationwide solution,” said Haag. “Corn growers support EPA moving forward to implement the governors’ notices for 2023 until a national solution, like the one senators introduced today, becomes law and resolves this issue once and for all.” Ensuring continued E15 sales year-round keeps a lower-emission fuel choice in the marketplace that costs less. E15 cuts evaporative, carbon and tailpipe emissions compared to standard 10 percent ethanol blended fuels. Blending more ethanol to make E15 displaces more toxic components in gasoline, reducing exhaust emissions for cleaner air.",

    "content": "U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack met with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador today to discuss a looming decree proposed by the Mexican president that would ban imports of biotech corn into the country. The talks come on the heels of an aggressive campaign by the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) encouraging the Biden administration to intervene in the dispute. “We are very appreciative of Secretary Vilsack for taking the lead on this issue that is so important to American corn growers,” said NCGA CEO Jon Doggett. “Today’s meeting shows that the Biden administration is listening to NCGA and American corn grower leaders and that Secretary Vilsack is willing to go to the mat for America’s farmers. This is an extremely important development.” A statement released tonight by USDA showed how strongly Secretary Vilsack feels about this issue. “We must find a way forward soon and I emphasized in no uncertain terms that – absent an acceptable resolution of the issue – the U.S. Government would be forced to consider all options, including taking formal steps to enforce our legal rights under the USMCA,” Vilsack said in a statement. Pres. López Obrador has promised to enact a decree that would end imports of corn grown using biotech and certain herbicides by 2024. Biotech corn makes up over 90% of U.S. corn crops. NCGA has been at the forefront of this issue. In a Reuters article published in September, NCGA called on USTR to intervene in the dispute and then followed up with an op-ed that reached across Washington. NCGA has also worked closely with Congress on the issue. “We will continue to press this issue with the Biden administration and other policymakers,” said Doggett. “But having the secretary of USDA in our corner comes as a great relief, as you can’t ask for a tougher or better advocate than Secretary Vilsack.”",

    "content": "In a letter sent today to U.S. Senate and House leadership, a broad coalition of energy and agriculture organizations called on Congress to quickly adopt legislation that would resolve inconsistent fuel volatility regulations. Specifically, the groups expressed support for legislation that would result in equal regulatory treatment for all gasoline blends containing 10 percent ethanol (E10) or more, including gasoline with 15 percent ethanol (E15). Such legislation would permanently remove the regulatory barrier that has historically made it extremely difficult for retailers to offer E15 in the summertime. The letter, sent to Senate Leaders Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, was signed by the Renewable Fuels Association, American Petroleum Institute, American Farm Bureau Federation, Association of Equipment Manufacturers, Growth Energy, National Association of Convenience Stores, National Corn Growers Association, National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, National Farmers Union, National Sorghum Producers, NATSO, representing truckstops and travel plazas, and SIGMA: America's Leading Fuel Marketers. “Due to the current policy, it is extremely difficult for many fuel marketers and retailers that may desire to offer E15 to their customers in the summer months to source that product,” according to the letter. “Our groups have come together—for the first time ever—to support legislation that would resolve this issue once and for all.” The groups are advocating for a simple legislative fix that would provide equal treatment nationwide to all gasoline blends containing 10 percent ethanol or more, while simultaneously superseding state regulatory action recently sought by a group of governors. “By ensuring uniformity across the nation’s fuel supply chain, federal legislation will provide more flexibility and result in more consistent outcomes than a state-by-state regulatory landscape,” the letter says. “In the absence of such legislation, we could see gasoline marketplace uncertainty and political disputes over E15 that would continue to resurface every summer. Thus, we urge Congress to act quickly to adopt legislation that will bring certainty and consistency to the fuel market, while also finally resolving long-standing differences among many stakeholders about fuel volatility regulations.”",

    "content": "Like other moments of economic uncertainty, this too shall pass... but how soon, and how much damage will it do? Inflationary costs—and rising interest rates—are hitting growers where it hurts worldwide. Add to these worries the impact of the North American drought, transportation and logistics headaches, and other market uncertainties, and growers may feel like the high price of corn is the only good news they've heard in more than a year. But what do you need to know to maintain your operation in this changing economic situation? What tools do we have to keep operating costs from spiraling out-of-control? And how much worse is it going to get before it gets better? In this episode, we’re talking to Todd Van Hoose, President and CEO of the Farm Credit Council, for the answers. Plus, we send our best to Jon Doggett, NCGA CEO and podcast host, as he nears his retirement date. Direct Share Link: https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ncga?selected=PDM7558109330 Transcript Todd Van Hoose: We're coming off a year where if you look at the amount of cash that's floating around out there on farm balance sheets, it's extraordinary. At the same time, you got to look at some of the sources of that cash. We see margins narrowing and we see a much more difficult time coming at us. Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host association's CEO Jon Doggett, from the fields of the corn belt to the DC Beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Inflationary costs and rising interest rates are hitting growers where it hurts worldwide. But what do you need to know to maintain your operation in this changing economic situation? What tools do we have to keep operating costs from spiraling out of control? And how much worse is it going to get before it gets better? In this episode, we're talking to Todd Van Hoose, president and CEO of the Farm Credit Council for the answers. But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also, make sure you follow the NCGA on Twitter at National Corn and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. And with that, it's time to once again introduce Jon, Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. And Jon, I'll admit I'm a little bit of a news junkie, for better and worse, and I know that you are too. And there's one word that I have heard so many times in the news over the last year, I don't care if I ever hear it again, and that word is inflation. Jon Doggett: Dusty, you're right. Inflation's been the biggest economic news story. And the growers don't call it inflation. It always starts with \"Jon, do you know how much I just had to pay,\" fill in the blank. And so it's definitely out there in a very big way. And yes, prices are up, but so are all the costs. And I don't care if you're raising corn in Iowa or cattle in Montana, everybody who's in production agriculture, and everybody in the country is looking at how much things cost anymore. And I was in the grocery store this weekend and the person in front of me and the person behind me both were talking about how much money they were spending to feed their family. And so inflation's here, and the other thing we're hearing a lot about is interest rates. And those two terms create some tough situations for many parts of the North American farm economy. So there's that tug of war between inflation and interest rates, and it feels like growers are on the rope right now. So want to have a conversation with someone who's got a whole lot more economic expertise to try and sort out what growers need to know about these challenging times. So we have Todd Van Hoose on speed dial. Todd's the president and the CEO of the Farm Credit Council with more than 30 years of experience in the Farm Credit System, the world of banking, Capitol Hill and the US Department of Agriculture. So Todd, thanks for joining us. Todd Van Hoose: Jon, glad to be here. You described me as having a lot more economic expertise. I'm worried you may outmatch me in that. Jon Doggett: Well, I'm going to give you a chance to go ahead and talk about that. So Todd, tell us about your background. What happened? How did you end up doing what you're doing and what you've been doing for the last 30 years? Todd Van Hoose: It's interesting, Jon. I grew up outside the front gate of a horse farm in Kentucky. I was in charge of painting fences for a dollar an hour. That was my introduction to agriculture as a 12 year old. Eventually, I found my way to Washington, not really to do policy, but to actually play baseball. And while I was playing baseball in Washington in college, I did an internship at USDA. The baseball thing didn't work out, the ag thing did. So here I am 30 some years later, still being involved in agriculture, loving every minute of it and found my way to the Farm Credit System, which is just an inspirational organization. It exists for a mission. It's owned by farmers. It's been a very happy marriage for me for many years now. Jon Doggett: So Todd, how would you describe the general state of the farm economy right now? Because I've heard it described to me by farmers and ranchers around the country. What's your take? Todd Van Hoose: I think we're in a very interesting time right now, Jon, because we're coming off a year where if you look at the amount of cash that's floating around out there on farm balance sheets, it's extraordinary. At the same time, you got to look at some of the sources of that cash and then you got to project forward. And you talked about it a little bit in your introduction, we see margins narrowing and we see a much more difficult time coming at us. We think by and large, and it's dangerous to make big generalities about the ag economy because every farm is different and every circumstance is different, but by and large, farmers are coming into what we expect to be a more difficult time with some room on their balance sheet. And they've had a couple years of good income, but boy, it's going to be a tough thing to manage moving forward. Jon Doggett: When I talk to growers, again, I'm hearing about what it costs to do business, the availability of spare parts, availability of equipment, all of those things are out there. Then the interest rates, and talking to a producer the other day about having to go in and redo his loan with the banker, and he kind of choked when the banker started quoting him what it was going to cost. Then we have the drought. I was in central Montana the last two weeks, and I don't know if it can rain in central Montana anymore, but it's across the country. Then you take a look at all these transportation issues. We have the rivers to load up float barges. We have the situation with the railroads and are they going to go on strike? Truckers are complaining about the high cost of diesel. We have all of these other issues with Mexico and trade issues. We have a lot going on right now. What does the banking industry look at when they look at all of this uncertainty? What are you talking to your folks in your system about and what are they talking to their borrowers about? Todd Van Hoose: Well, all of the things you just mentioned, but especially because we're banks fundamentally and interest rates are a big part of our business and we've seen them go up in almost an unprecedented way. Now, a lot of us of a certain age have seen these levels of interest rates before, but maybe not the suddenness with which we've seen these interest rates rise across the last year. To give you a little bit of a sense of it, in January of 2022, the one year treasury interest rate was less than half a percent and had been for a long time. As of today, that same interest rate is almost 5%. So I'm not much of a math student, but that's a heck of a big increase. Now, we have seen a lot of our customers lock in those low interest rates on land loans looking backwards. You've had a long time to lock in a lot of those longer term interest rates on your land. But when you're talking about renewing operating lines, when you're talking about corporate agribusiness finance, all of that's done on a short term basis and these short term interest rates are spiking and that's making a big difference for everybody. At the same time, cost is one thing on inputs, and we're hearing a ton about that, but we're also hearing availability, people being worried about, \"Gosh, I wonder if I can get it at any cost.\" And that's a first in my experience. And so I agree with you, the level of uncertainty out there is really exceptional. And what I keep telling everybody is all of these things combined, whether it's transportation, interest rates, inflation, certainly the weather, trade difficulties, everything you can imagine, imagine how difficult it is today to manage a farming operation, and imagine the skill set farmers have to have today to make a successful go of it. I think farmers are today the most sophisticated we've ever seen in history and the greatest managers we've ever seen in history. And boy, they better be because this is going to be tough. Dusty Weis: I wanted to build on that point, Jon. And Todd raised some great points there. But one thing that I've always liked about working in agriculture is the fact that farmers are by their nature kind of an optimistic group. So Jon, you talk to these folks all the time, how are they adjusting to all these inflationary pressures that they're feeling? Jon Doggett: They're optimists, but they do know how to complain. I have noticed that just a bit. Like I say, a lot of conversations I've had with growers over the last year, it starts with, \"Do you know how much I just paid for...?\" There is a lot of concern, there's a little nervousness, maybe here and there a tad bit of fear. But I think by and large, it's they're looking at, \"What do I need to do to change my operation in order to deal with this uncertainty?\" I had several growers in the last few months say basically the same thing is, \"I have issues, I have problems, but it's the uncertainty. How many variables are going to be out there that I have to deal with?\" Getting back to Todd's comment, these are really good managers. The people who are poor managers, they're not in the business anymore. So the good managers are there, but boy, they're managing at a completely different level than they were even three, four years ago. So it's going to be a real challenge for everyone in agriculture, and I don't care what part of agriculture you're in. It's going to be one where we're going to have to be very adaptive and we're going to have to be bold and we're going to have to be brave. I think there are some really great things out there on the horizon, but boy, we've got some short term issues that we got to deal with in between now and then. Todd Van Hoose: Jon, I absolutely agree with what you said. I had our board in here last week, that was a whole group of farmers sitting around. And the entire discussion was, \"How can I economize moving forward given what these margins are expected to do? Even the face of some pretty decent commodity prices, wow can I trim my organization's expense side? It's certainly not interest rates, you're getting hit there, but can I use less inputs? Can I put off a new piece of equipment until next year?\" All of those are just significant decisions that farmers are having to make right now. Jon Doggett: In the high prices make that in some ways better, and in some ways make it more difficult. You look at the price of corn today and had you talked about, \"Well, would corn be pushing seven bucks?\" If you'd said that three years ago, folks would say, \"Gosh, we get to $7 corn, everything's going to be pretty great.\" Well, are they getting that great? So again, it's a lot of adjustments that growers have to make. So how are your lenders working with those growers to make those adjustments within their operations and to be able to continue to get operating money and to continue to farm? Todd Van Hoose: The good news is that Farm Credit's seen this all before. 106 years in agriculture, and we've seen a lot of cycles come in, a lot of cycles go. And so if this is 40 years ago, people are sort of lending to farmers based on the value of their collateral. They're based on land values and how much space do you have? Well, today it's a much more sophisticated decision making tree. And so farmers have a farm plan, they understand their budget, they understand their inputs, they understand their opportunities in the marketplace. And so we're sitting down with farmers as we head into the end of this year and the beginning of renewal season next year and looking at those farm plans and saying, \"Okay, how can we support you? Where do you need money? But keep in mind, you've got to be able to deal with this uncertainty.\" And you talked about corn prices where they are today. I think we'd all have taken that deal at any time. But at the same time, we sort of understand if you're looking at that farm plan, you can sort of have some expectation on your receipts. You can sort of have some expectation about what you're going to sell your crop for. But we know prices historically have come down a lot faster on the commodity side than they have on the input side. And how are you going to balance that toward the end of the year when things get a little sideways potentially? And so having lots of operating flexibility, a good grasp of your costs, a good grasp of your marketing opportunities is going to be critical. Jon Doggett: Looking at both sides of the ledger is really important. My dad used to say that he made more money when times were tough than when times were good. And I think that's part of the challenge right now is, how do you get that operating cost down and at the same time still get the work done you need to do? So Todd, having lived through the '80s, and I know you did and watched agriculture in a just horrible mess that we had in the '80s, what did we learn from the '80s and what do we need to do to keep from going back to the eighties? Todd Van Hoose: Jon, I think we learned a lot, and it's now 40 years later, but we learned a lot. And one of the things we learned was cash flow is king and you cannot finance things and farmers cannot take for granted the value of the underlying assets. Everybody thought they were going to go up forever and maybe they will. But when you see spiking interest rates, when you see changes in demand, a lot of uncertainty out there. So lenders especially have learned from the 1980s. And if you look at the farmers' balance sheet right now, agriculture is leveraged, and this is sophisticated financial stuff, but farmers are leveraged at about 14%. And if you look at all other industries out there, that is a fraction of the leverage that other industries have. And so farmers, there's a lot of talk about, they borrow a lot of money and they do, but as a percentage of their assets, they don't borrow all that much. And so we don't see farmers really leveraging to the hilt anymore. We don't see lenders encouraging that behavior by lending them a lot of money. And so we think that both the lending side and the farmer's side have learned valuable lessons. Now, one of the things we're facing right now, and Jon, your upcoming transition is a symptom of it, there's a lot of us who are around in the '80s that aren't going to be around for very much longer. Jon Doggett: You're talking only in the professional sense though, right Todd? Todd Van Hoose: In the professional sense, of course. Yes, yes, yes. But when we bring in new loan officers, we're bringing in 25, 30 year olds, they weren't even born then. And so we haven't had that period now for a long time. And memories can get short. And so we constantly walk through, \"Here's what happened, here's the bubble that got created. Here's what happened when it popped. And we got to work really hard not to allow that to happen again.\" So I think there's been valuable lessons. Jon Doggett: One of my mentors many years ago said, \"One of the things we need to remember in agriculture is it's not always going to be the way it is today. It's not always going to be the way it is today.\" And that was the problem in the '80s is we all thought that it was never going to get better, and in the last 10 years it was only going to get better. And so that's kind of the way we've had to learn some things. And sometimes that's been a hard, hard, hard lesson. So Todd, you mentioned farmers, ranchers have a lot more equity to deal with than they did back in the '80s And as an aside, I repossessed farm equipment for a short period of time back in the '80s and it's something that I will always remember, my knees aren't any good, so I can't run 50 miles an hour in a low crouch, in a zigzag pattern anymore. But those land values, they're so high and they're beyond what really, if you're a farmer going out and buying ground right now, how do you pencil that out with some of these prices the way they are? How does that affect what your industry does when you look at these loans? Farmer comes in as the next generation with them, they're saying, \"We don't want to own all the land in the county, just everything that adjoins us.\" And you're talking about buying a section of ground at 15, 16, $17,000 an acre. Where does that fit into the family operation? How does that fit into what the banking industry looks at? Todd Van Hoose: Well, look, land values are really, really important. They're the backbone of agriculture. If you look at the farm balance sheet, that is the basis for stability out there. But we all know it's a double edged sword. These land values run ups that we've seen across the last 20 years have been great for people who own land. That made people pretty stable. At the same time, if you're trying to get in right now or if you're trying to make a particular purchase cash flow, you just can't do it. And that's the reality of where we are right now. And so everybody hears that story about that one place in the county that went for some outrageous amount of money. Everybody out there listening could go, \"Oh yeah, I know about that.\" But let me tell you what that means. That means somebody had cash. And so when we see a lot of farm ground turning over out there, we're seeing cash purchases. We're not seeing people leveraging those purchases with a lot of debt. And whether it's been a lot of federal payments, whether it's been good profitability years, for whatever reason. We look at it as, look, if a farmer wants to pay that for their ground, that's their choice. Absolutely their decision. They can do whatever they want to. But for lenders, we have to continue to keep an eye on, is there cashflow? Can you pencil that out in your operation? Now, some of these large purchases we are seeing some investors come in, non-farm investors because the stock market been a little bit questionable here lately so that'll drive some people into alternative investments including agriculture. But most of it, we're seeing larger operations just add on. As you said, nobody wants anything but the farm that touches theirs. And so we're seeing, as you enter period where you've got these elevated prices, if you've got an operation that has the cash flow, you can add that in there and continue to cash flow it. But boy, for a family trying to transition right now, I would hate to sit at that dinner table and try to work that out because the kids can't afford to buy it and the parents can't afford to sell it at a discount. That is a tough situation. Dusty Weis: Todd, I recently had the opportunity to buy a piece of ground myself, and what I wound up paying for it is not something that 10 years ago I would've looked at and said, \"Oh, this is a reasonable price for land.\" And looking at it now, I actually feel like I scooted away with a little bit of a bargain there. But while I was in the process of negotiating over this whole thing, I was working with a realtor and he said, \"They're not making any more land. It's the rule of supply and demand.\" And certainly that factor is still in play, but there are a lot of other factors now. And I guess all that is a really roundabout way of asking you, have those values plateaued now? Are we going to see them continue to rise? Or where do you see the future of land values going and how can farmers work to prepare for whatever that future might be? Todd Van Hoose: I don't think anybody quite has that crystal ball, but we have seen the increases slow down. Now with that said, there's still these one off situations everybody hears about where three people get in and try to bid against each other and there's a big number. But for the most part, the big steep increases have plateaued a little bit. So we think there's some stability there. I would just remind people that fundamentally, all of us in this country won the geographic lottery when we were born here, because you're exactly right, they're not making more ground and we've got the best and the most in this country. And so I think that's always going to be a very, very valuable asset. And going into the future, it'll be even more valuable. Now, are we going to see the rate of increase that we've seen across the last 10, 12 years? Probably not. At the same time, you don't see a situation where suddenly nobody's going to want that ground. And so look, as lenders, we really value stability in land values because spiking land values and dropping land values increase risk, so stability's very important. But farmers need to factor all of that in when they're thinking about, \"What's my time horizon? How am I going to make this pencil out?\" Like I say, today's farmers are the most sophisticated managers we've ever seen in agriculture. This is another part of what they have to manage. Jon Doggett: So Todd, and I'm going to ask you to dust off your crystal ball just a little bit, what are your predictions for the next 12 months? What are the things that we know to be true for 2023? What are the knowns that may not be known? And what are the unknowns for 2023? What do you think we're going to look at, say in November of 2023, looking back at the 12 months behind us? Todd Van Hoose: There's some big picture things and some small picture things. Big picture things, certainly as you look around the world geopolitical situation, Russia, Ukraine, there's real questions about food supply in some parts of the world, climate change, drought. Those are really big things that are impacting agriculture right now. And then you start to look at a little more micro level, what are the commodity prices going to be? We think they're going to continue to be pretty good. We think demand is continuing to be very, very strong. At least that's what all the farm economists tell us. But what we don't know is, what's that supply chain going to do? Are we going to be able to keep equipment repairs? I can't tell you how many farmers I've talked to about, \"I couldn't get a part during harvest season this year.\" That was just the story of the harvest. And so things that we never really had to worry about because it was always on the next truck to the supply dealer, well, suddenly that's a big deal. And I think those are the big unknowns out there. Everything from what can I get to my farm to how are all these things going on in the world going to impact overall market access? Jon Doggett: I'm going to take just a little side trip and ask a question, Todd, about climate change. And I worked that issue many, many years ago at the American Farm Bureau, and certainly farmers' view of climate change has changed a lot in that time period. Because your operation lends money across the country, not just row crop agriculture, what are you seeing concerns about climate change and how people want or are dealing with that? That's that variable that doesn't depend on the Fed, It doesn't depend on the Board of Trade, it doesn't depend on inputs from Morocco. What are you doing in your industry to address that? Todd Van Hoose: We're working really hard to understand the impacts of it. Farm Credit is never going to push farmers for certain production practices. We're not going to be telling them, \"Oh, you've got to do this, that, or the other thing with your carbon.\" That is not our role and we never want it to be our role. But at the same time, we and farmers both have to understand what the risks are out there. And we've all been dealing with weather-related risks for our entire lives. We understand that, but those risks are getting much more acute. You look in California where historically massively valuable production areas, some of the highest dollar crop places you could ever be, are they going to have water next year? Are these coastal areas going to continue to get hit just like we had in Florida last month? And those are real risks that farmers have always had to deal with, but they're just a little more acute now. And when you talk about the changing drought conditions someplace, climate change actually makes it rain in more places if you listen to the scientists, and how will that affect agriculture? There's a lot of farmers in Illinois right now who are saying they've had some pretty good yields because they've had some pretty good rain. And so all of those things are very much a part of what financial institutions are trying to better understand so they can work with customers to identify the risks and make sure people are making prudent plans out there. Jon Doggett: So Todd, the NCGA and our state associations really appreciate the partnership we've had with the Farm Credit System for many, many, many years. So as we look forward to the 2023 Farm Bill, the Farm Credit System and NCGA has some shared priorities. Todd, can you talk about some of the places we're working together on? Todd Van Hoose: Well, certainly crop insurance is at the top of the list. Crop insurance has become the backbone of risk management and agriculture. It is a great program and we never want to see that go backwards and we'd like to see it pushed forward a little bit. Are there some tweaks out there that we can get done in this Farm Bill to make it more attractive for farmers? At the same time, I think there's going to be some challenges to the Crop Insurance Program depending on how this election comes out, depending on who's running things next year. I think we could have some challenges on crop insurance, but we will stand shoulder to shoulder with you on that. The other area is climate change, and we're all working as part of the Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance. I know NCGA is in there, we're in there, a lot of farm groups are in there. That is a really important place where agriculture can come together, and I call it reality test, because the view of agriculture in Washington in a lot of places is about two generations old. And they don't understand modern agriculture in Washington for the most part. They don't understand the management challenges we're facing. And so having something like FACA, the Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance, that can take a look at some of these, what we expect to be kind of out there proposals maybe, and reality check them and say, \"Here's what that means to agriculture.\" And if you start to put unreasonable burdens on already tightening margins out there, what are you really going to do? You're going to push more agricultural production into places around the globe that do it a lot less ecologically friendly than we do in the United States. And so calling those kinds of things to question, really rallying agriculture to make sure that some of these very well intentioned member of Congress, I don't doubt they're intentioned, I doubt their understanding. And so that organization I think is going to be really important in this Farm Bill as we fend off some of these more esoteric proposals and hopefully come to something that says, \"Here's some incentives that we can make available for farmers out there to help them deal with the climate change reality they're facing. Jon Doggett: Certainly FACA has been a really good group for all of us to be involved in. And we have ag groups, we have the lending industry, the environmental community is well represented in that. And it's great to watch what that organization has done because they're coming up with solutions or they're dealing with proposals to make those proposals work rather than not work. And so it is the bright spot, I think recently of how we're going to deal with some of these policy issues, and hopefully we can replicate them again and again. Todd Van Hoose: Let me just add one gratuitous compliment here, and that is in agriculture, we're a minority in Washington and a small interest group collectively in Washington. And we've got a bunch of really talented people working in this area on behalf of farmers. And certainly Jon, your upcoming transition in retirement is something that should be very noticeable in Washington because your long experience and great dedication to agriculture has had an impact for farmers across the country. And we're grateful for everything you've done and all the effort and passion you've brought to supporting agriculture in a long career in DC. It's been hard at times. And so we really appreciate that and certainly congratulate you on your fantastic career and wish you well as you transition. Jon Doggett: Well, thank you so much, and I greatly appreciate that. And it's nice to hear that from a banker too. Some of those conversations years ago wasn't so great, so thank you very much. But nobody's done this by themselves. And one of the great things about agriculture is that we've stuck together. We can have our battles, and we generally have those behind closed doors and then come out with the room with a black eye and say, \"Everybody's getting along really well,\" and we've done that over and over again. I hope we can continue to do that. That's going to be what's really going to be important going into the future. I'm terribly impressed with all of the young people that are coming up behind the Todd Van Hooses and myself and John Gordley and Dale Moore and all of those folks that have been around for a long time. There's some really neat, wonderful young people who are every bit is dedicated, and in a lot of cases, a whole lot smarter than some of us. And when I get nervous and when I get down, I start looking at those folks and say, \"Gosh, we brought a good new crop of folks to come up and deal with some new problems.\" And those young folks that are coming along, they're going to have an industry that's seen hard times before and have been much harder in the past. And we have measures in place today that are going to help farmers get through some of this unsettledness that we have right now in our economy and our country, and certainly in agriculture. So we are, at NCGA, so appreciative of having great partners like the Farm Credit Council to work with to do some great things for American agriculture and great things for the country and the world. So Todd Van Hoose, president and CEO of the Farm Credit Council, thank you for that partnership and thank you so much for joining us on this podcast. Todd Van Hoose: Thank you, Jon. Dusty Weis: And as Todd departs, now, Jon, we would of course be remiss here if we didn't take a moment to note the passing of another major milestone, and Todd certainly hinted at it there, but that is your upcoming retirement as the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. So first and foremost, congratulations and good luck with what's next, certainly. But also from the ranch in Montana to your career on the business side of agriculture since the 1980s, to 25 years working on behalf of the National Corn Growers Association and these last four years as the CEO, you have seen and done some remarkable things in your career. What do you take away from that experience? Jon Doggett: Oh, what I take away from it is that there are a lot of people who grew up in farms and ranches around this country who came to Washington DC to do good. Some of us did well as well as did good, but there's a lot of people who really are passionate about agriculture, who a lot of times people don't see. A lot of times they don't recognize that ag LA working in the bowels of the Rayburn building to get something done, that's a really important person. And there's just been so many wonderful people that I've been able to come to know and to work with throughout these years. It's just really remarkable how many folks there are. Dusty Weis: And there was a time in this country when everybody knew someone who worked in agriculture or everybody was just a generation or two removed from the farm. And certainly the world has changed in that way, and it can make it feel a lot more disconnected from what happens out in farm country. But I've got to say, I've only had the pleasure of knowing you for the last few years here since we started doing this podcast. And that was one of the things that you wanted to address with this podcast is to reconnect those two worlds a little bit. This is episode 39 that we've got here. We have recorded on Capitol Hill, we have recorded at the Kentucky Bourbon Museum, at Commodity Classic in New Orleans. We have talked to Gold Medal Olympians to CNN correspondents, retired MLB stars, members of Congress. I don't want to ask you to pick your favorite kid here, but what are some of the podcast experiences that you'll take with you when you go? Jon Doggett: I think my favorite kid on this are the two segments we did with Abigail Spanberger and Dusty Johnson, a moderate Democrat and a conservative Republican talking about how we can do better in this country by reaching across the aisle, by listening to people, by putting down the rhetoric and instead start thinking about solutions. Those two episodes were the ones that, in fact, I came back to one of them here a couple months ago. It was one of those days where you go, \"Gosh, is there anybody out there listening to some of the concerns that a lot of people in this country have?\" They're there, we just need to help them along. And I don't care which party you support, but as long as we bring people who come to Washington looking for solutions rather than looking to fight, I think that our country will be much better. So those two I really, really, really enjoyed. And those are the ones that resonated with a lot of people that listen to this podcast of, hey, it's not as crazy or as bad as we might sometimes think it is. Dusty Weis: You provided a platform for the middle, and that's not necessarily something that happens a whole lot. I said it then, I'll say it now, I think it's neat that you had the opportunity to do that. But be honest with me Jon, Neil Caskey is your vice president of communications at the National Corn Growers Association, when he came to you with the idea to put you behind a microphone as a podcast host, is this something that you had any interest in doing whatsoever? Jon Doggett: No Dusty Weis: I knew it. Jon Doggett: Neil said, \"You ought to do a podcast.\" And I said, \"Why?\" He said, \"No, this would be a good thing for us to do.\" \"Are you sure?\" And I kind of was brought into this thing kicking and screaming. I did not think it was going to be as fun as it's been. It's been fun. I've thoroughly enjoyed this podcast and I've enjoyed the guests we've had, I've enjoyed the conversations we've had, and what I've really enjoyed is that I've had people say, \"Hey, I listened to the podcast. It gave me a different perspective,\" and that was what I was looking for. So Neil had a great idea, I'm going to give him that, and I'm going to give him kudos for pushing me into this. And Dusty, you have been such a great mentor to me and kind of shown me the ropes of how to get through some of this. I've had a little bit of experience in radio many, many years ago, and I've touched back on some of that. But you have been a great host. And of course, Larry is a great, great producer and helps you and I both sound smarter than we really are. Dusty Weis: Well, thank goodness for Larry, let me tell you. Jon Doggett: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. What will we do without Larrys in the world? Dusty Weis: But in that vein, thank you for your kind words. And I consider you a mentor from where I'm sitting too, because of those discussions that you have helped curate and because of your thoughtful and patient approach, not just to politics, not just to the world of agriculture and the world of Washington DC, but to everything in life. And you've exposed me to some new perspectives and some new ideas that I probably wouldn't have come across otherwise. And so thank you for that as well. You said early on in this podcast project that you wanted to use conversation and stories to bridge that gap between farm life and life in the heart of DC. What are some of the lessons these three years later that DC can take away from rural America, would you say, and vice versa, that we've learned over the 39 episodes that we've done in this podcast? Jon Doggett: I think the main thing that we continue to uncover is the need to be kinder with one another, to be more patient. We have gone in our body politic from, if you get half and I get half, that's great, and we'll come back and we'll battle again tomorrow and do it again. Anymore, it's not only should I get everything that I need, but I should get everything that I want, and you should get absolutely nothing. Dusty Weis: And I'm going to burn your house down. And I'm going to say some really unpleasant things about your mom on Twitter. Yeah. Jon Doggett: Yeah. And I live in a very contested congressional district here in Northern Virginia, and it's just absolutely astounding to me the nastiness. And a lot of this is coming in the form of Super PACs, you don't know who's funding them, all of those things. I just think if we could all just take a deep breath, be a little kinder to one another, practice what we hear in the pew on Sunday, maybe to be a little bit better mannered as our grandmothers attempted to teach us. We live in the greatest country in the world. We work in the greatest industry that we possibly can work in. We have so much going for us, and we just need to be reminded every day of the goodness that exists in this country and the goodness that exists in agriculture and with one another and with one another. We're all we have. Dusty Weis: To those ends, in farming as in much of life, the imperative is always leave it better than you found it. And so as you look back at your tenure with the National Corn Growers Association, these decades that you've served, what are some of your proudest accomplishments? How'd you leave it better than you found it? Jon Doggett: I'd say definitely is the great staff that we've put together. We've worked really hard to get the absolute best people we could do. And I have to give a shout out to Sam Willett who worked for me. He was at the DC office when I started. And as we started to fill the positions that were coming open, Sam worked with me hand in glove, and we really had a great opportunity to build a good team into a better team and a better team into a great team. As I leave now, I am more than confident that the people I've had the great honor to work with are going to continue to do a great job for the nation's corn growers. And that's the thing I'm most proud of, is just the ability to hire, mentor, and work with really super people. Dusty Weis: We called the podcast Wherever Jon May Roam, because you're a man that roams a lot, goes on a lot of professional adventures, sees and does a lot of really incredible things. And I just need to ask you, you might be sick of the question by now, but what's next? Where does Jon Roam next? What adventures does retirement hold for Jon Doggett? Jon Doggett: There's the underlying, as people say, \"He's going to go spend more time with his family.\" But people say, \"Well, where do you live?\" And I said, \"Out of a black Samsonite suitcase.\" And that's what I've done for the last number of years. I'm looking forward to spending more time with my family, more time with my wife, my mom who turned 92 last week, with my brothers, working with cattle, being around my kids, and really most importantly, being around my two granddaughters. I'm looking forward to that. That's the main thing I want to do. But I also want to keep my hand in the policy arena, Maybe not in the DC policy arena as much as just work on trying to find some solutions to things and work with people who are like-minded and want to resolve some issues. I have some things I've been doing, some volunteer work with Big Brothers and Sisters of America that is really, really cool. I have some other things. I have some adventures I want to continue to do. I want to get back and paddle more. I haven't been in my kayak nearly as much as I should the last few years. And I talked to one of my coaches over the weekend and she is pushing me very hard to go and get back into pursuit of my skydiving license. So there's going to be some adventures. And I'm looking forward to those adventures, I don't know exactly what they are. And some days that's kind of cool that I'm going to have these adventures and I know they're out there, but then there's other days I go, \"Oh gosh, this is scary. I've known what I was going to do every morning when I woke up for the last 35 years. I'm not real sure what I'm going to do when I wake up come January 1st.\" But whatever it's going to be, it'll be fun. And I hope to do it with a lot of great people, which has been the secret of what success I've had. Dusty Weis: And Jon, retirement is scary for some people because they worry about just not having enough to keep them busy and settling into that chair and growing roots like a potato, as my mom would say. And that's certainly not something that I worry about happened into you. You've got a full docket, and from the skydiving to the paddling and everything in between, I have no doubt that you're going to stay active and make the most of it. And I've got to say, it's been a rare pleasure to be able to have these conversations and tell these stories with you. In your absence now, I'm going to be muddling on in the role of NCGA Podcast host, along with some great guests who are going to help me out as well. It doesn't make sense to call it Wherever Jon May Roam anymore, and so we're going to be rolling out a new brand, a new logo, all of that, but still carrying on to tell those stories that are so important to this industry and its growers. So I thank you for your candor and your honesty, your friendship, and your commitment to preserving the way of life that we all hold dear. Best wishes for what's ahead. Certainly don't be a stranger. Stay in touch. But for old time's sake, you want to lock us out one more time, Jon Doggett? Jon Doggett: I'm Jon Doggett. I'm the NCGA CEO. And we hope you'll join us again real soon for the next episode of the National Corn Growers Association podcast. And thank you. Dusty Weis: Thank you, Jon. Congratulations. Best wishes. Take care.

    "title": "Meet the Action Team Helping to Bring STEM to Classrooms Across the Country",
    "content": "Today is National STEM Day! The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) believes that agriculture is a vital partner in engaging students in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) concepts which directly—and indirectly—impact their lives. Not only does teaching an ag-based curriculum in the science classroom spark students to solve real-world science issues, but it also familiarizes them with ag-related careers, many of which go unfilled. NCGA is committed to growing a more sustainable future—which includes carving a legacy for future generations. Today’s students will be tomorrow’s decision-makers and stewards of the land. NCGA’s Sustainable Ag Research Action Team (SARAT) recently led the charge in impacting change by partnering with DonorsChoose—a teacher-founded nonprofit which helps bridge the gap and create equity for underfunded schools. Through matched funds with donors, NCGA’s 2022 project supported 122 STEM-based projects at 107 different schools across 26 states, impacting over 19,000 students over the course of just two months. “Being socially sustainable is an integral pillar for us as corn growers,” said Minnesota dairy farmer and Sustainable Ag Research Action Team Vice Chair Dana Allen-Tully. “NCGA knows sustainability is essential to feeding and fueling our growing world. And sustainability isn’t just limited to how you treat the land; it also includes the people who work it, the investments we make, and how we prepare for the future. That is what SARAT is concentrating on—the future—and how we cultivate relationships and strive for continuous improvement within the arenas of education and research.” To learn more about some of SARAT’s educational and research initiatives: Find activities and lessons on biotechnology, biofuels, water quality, soil and sustainability by visiting the Nourish the Future's (NTF) curriculum page. And for science teachers looking to take their STEM knowledge and skills to the next level, consider applying for NTF’s Teacher Learner Community IV.

    "title": "After Calls for Action Over Dispute on Biotech Corn Exports, USTR Discusses Issue with Mexican Counterpart",
    "content": "Following repeated calls from the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) asking the Biden administration to respond to plans by Mexico to block imports of biotech corn, United States Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai met virtually on Thursday with Mexico’s Secretary of Economy, Raquel Buenrostro. During the meeting, Tai talked about the importance of avoiding a disruption in U.S. corn exports. “We applaud Ambassador Tai for listening to corn grower leaders and sharing our concerns with the leadership in Mexico,” said NCGA President Tom Haag. “But, given the magnitude of Mexico’s threats and the fact that the embargo is set to be fully implemented by 2024, we need USTR to resolve the impasse as soon as possible by filing a dispute under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).” The dispute centers around Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s decree that would end imports of corn grown using biotech and certain herbicides by 2024. Biotech corn makes up over 90% of U.S. corn crops. One recent estimate projected a 30% increase in the price of tortillas in Mexico from the embargo. NCGA has strongly encouraged USTR to file a dispute under the agriculture chapter of USMCA, which calls for cooperation between members on an individual government’s regulation of imports. An op-ed by Haag was recently published in The Hill, a newspaper widely read by Washington policymakers and decision-makers. Corn grower leaders also continue raising the issue with lawmakers and major media outlets. A USMCA dispute settlement would allow for extensive debate and mediation that could head off a calamitous outcome.",

    "content": "Viewers of Cattlemen to Cattlemen on RFD-TV will get a firsthand look at the value of corn and beef exports at the Port of New Orleans. The episode will re-air on Tuesday, November 1 at 8:30 PM ET. National Corn Growers Association's (NCGA) Market Development Action Team (MDAT) funded this initiative. In 2021, beef and pork exports accounted for 537 million bushels of corn usage. “The U.S. is the world’s leading exporter of corn and when you pair that with the success of exports of the beef industry, it is an important demand driver for corn farmers,” said National Corn Growers Association President and Minnesota farmer Tom Haag. “Being at the Port of New Orleans for this episode was a great backdrop because of the amount of agricultural goods and product that goes out of this port.” Panel participants include Tom Haag, NCGA President and Minnesota farmer; National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) President and Minnesota farmer Don Schiefelbein; NCGA Market Development Action Team Chair and Colorado corn and beef producer Troy Schneider; and Kyla Hamilton, a Texas corn and beef producer who also serves on MDAT. Special interview segments are also a part of the show this year, with Janine Mansour who is head of business development for the Port of New Orleans and Dean Meyer, Chair-Elect of the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF).

The response from corn growers comes as Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s promises to enact a decree that would end imports of corn grown using biotech and certain herbicides by 2024. Biotech corn makes up over 90% of U.S. corn crops. An opinion piece by NCGA President Tom Haag was published over the weekend in The Hill, a newspaper widely read by Congress and other Washington decision-makers, calling on USTR to file a settlement dispute under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement over the matter. “If the decree is enacted, the negative impact will be felt by farmers in the U.S. and by the people of Mexico,” Haag noted. “We’re now looking to the Biden administration to intervene to ensure that corn exports to Mexico don’t come to a sudden stop.” NCGA has been at the forefront of this issue. In a major Reuters article published in September, NCGA also called on USTR to intervene in the dispute. A USMCA dispute settlement would allow for extensive debate and mediation and would head off a calamitous outcome. Noting bags of seed purchased this fall will be in grain channels as late as 2025, Haag says that Mexico’s demands are not only a non-starter, but that they would also have to be made years in advance. “We need USTR to act soon and the problem to be resolved quickly, because while some might think the clock is ticking, in reality, we’re already out of time,” he says.",

    "content": "With the Department of Energy’s announcement to release 15 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) called on policymakers to advance ethanol as a solution to increase the nation’s fuel supply and lower prices for American consumers at the pump. NCGA also highlighted a new report that found nationwide E15 sales would save drivers over $20 billion in annual fuel costs. “We welcome the administration’s continued focus on energy security, but we can’t lose sight of the need for long-term solutions,” NCGA Vice President of Public Policy Brooke Appleton said. “While a further SPR release may provide some short-term relief, expanding access to higher biofuel blends and advancing fuel policy solutions help extend fuel supplies, lower costs for consumers and shore-up America’s energy security for the long run.” Ethanol adds nearly 15 billion gallons to our fuel supply every year, lowering demand for high-cost oil while increasing the total fuel available to consumers. Ethanol also costs less than gasoline. When gas prices climbed to all-time highs during the summer, NCGA reminded policymakers that ethanol was priced $1 per gallon less than unblended gasoline at wholesale and drivers are still saving up to30 cents or more per gallon where retailers offer E15. A new study by Growth Energy conducted by ABF Economics found that nationwide E15, a 15% blend of ethanol, would save consumers $20.6 billion in annual fuel costs and put an additional $36.3 billion of income into the pockets of American households. Additionally, a new analysis by the Renewable Fuels Association found that the Biden administration’s decision to allow E15 to be sold during the 2022 summer driving season saved American consumers $57 million. NCGA supports policy solutions to ensure full market access for E15 going forward. NCGA also supports the Next Generation Fuels Act, legislation that would establish a clean, low-carbon high-octane standard for fuel and future vehicles, cutting fuel costs and emissions and increasing efficiency to provide long-term energy security.",

The bipartisan group, led by Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), also encouraged the administrator to use the pending rulemaking to optimize the RFS to deliver greater environmental and economic benefits from renewable fuels such as ethanol. In a change from prior years, EPA will now determine RFS volumes based on a set of environmental and economic factors and guardrails in the statute. Biofuels such as ethanol cut greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions and lower prices at the pump, benefitting the environment and consumers. As senators stated in their letter: “Through this rulemaking, EPA has a historic opportunity to not only reinforce its efforts to restore integrity to the RFS, but chart a new course for biofuels that will help meet America’s diverse energy demands while further decarbonizing numerous sectors of our economy.” NCGA has also weighed in with EPA on RFS volume obligations in 2023 and beyond. NCGA President Tom Haag said corn growers appreciate the Senate support for biofuels as a key energy and environment solution and agree EPA has new opportunities to capitalize on biofuels through this RFS transition. “Corn growers are grateful for the senators’ bipartisan advocacy for renewable fuels as EPA prepares to open a new chapter of the RFS,” Haag said. “EPA has a prime opportunity here to use the RFS as an even stronger tool in efforts to cut emissions, address climate change, increase our domestic fuel supply, hold down prices and continue to grow rural economies.” Through 2022, the RFS statute specified annual volume targets for renewable fuels, reaching an implied volume of 15 billion gallons for ethanol. Beginning with 2023, EPA will determine RFS volumes based on a set of qualitative environmental, economic and agriculture factors, providing EPA with paths to grow the RFS and renewable fuel use. EPA is expected to issue a proposed rule by November 16. In addition to Senators Thune and Durbin, those signing the letter to EPA were: Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Tina Smith (D-Minn.).",

    "title": "EP. 38 - Winning in the Margins for Corn, with Outgoing NCGA President Chris Edgington",
    "content": "As Chris Edgington wraps up his term as NCGA President, we look back at the meaningful progress corn growers made in 2022. 2022 has been another one of those years that throws a lot of curve balls at you. But in the world of agriculture, you can’t just hit home runs all the time. It might not get the headlines, but the real work gets done in the singles and doubles that you hit, and you’ve got to hit those reliably. And so in this episode, we look back at some of the wins for the industry that you might not have heard about, with outgoing NCGA President Chris Edgington as he winds down his term in office. From tariffs on inputs to new regulations, the association has battled back against developments that would have cost farmers dearly. At the same time, new support for ethanol fuel is moving forward in Washington and could be a huge boon to growers. Make sure to REGISTER YOUR CONCERNS WITH THE EPA about its plans to revise registration for atrazine, which would effectively limit the effectiveness of this critical crop protection tool. Also, the Next Generation Fuels Act is one of NCGA’s top legislative priorities. CLICK HERE to ask your congressional representatives to cosponsor it. Direct Share Link: https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ncga?selected=PDM3106386273 Transcript Chris Edgington: One individual in agriculture, for the most part, can't accomplish much. You have to have people working with you. And in our organization, National Corn can't get it all done all by themselves. They need the states to work with them. We need the agri-industry to work with them. And quite honestly, we need the other commodity groups. Dusty Weis: Hello and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, Growers and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host, Association CEO Jon Doggett. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway. We're making sure the Growers who feed America, have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. It's been another wild and unexpected kind of year for Growers. Big headline grabbing issues have dominated the conversation even as the NCGA continues to work nationwide on behalf of its Grower members. And as his term as Corn Growers President winds down, we thought it would be a good time to go back and revisit some of the wins for the industry that you might not have heard about with outgoing NCGA President, Chris Edgington, who's joining us from his farm in St. Ansgar, Iowa. Dusty Weis: But if you haven't yet make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also, make sure you follow the NCGA on Twitter @NationalCorn and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter@ncga.com. And with that it's time to once again, introduce, Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. And Jon, I got my first introduction to Chris Edgington about a year ago when we had him on the show to welcome him to his term as NCGA President. Now that year has flown by and here we are already thanking him for his service and sending him on his way after a job well done. Jon Doggett: That year really did go by very fast. And Dusty, it's another one of those years that we had a lot of curve balls, a lot of curve balls, and I've been around Washington and agriculture my whole life, and been around DC for 35 years. You can't hit homeruns all the time, in fact, you don't hit him very often. It might not get the headlines, but the real work gets done in the singles and the doubles that you hit and you got to hit those reliably. So it's been a relief to have someone like Chris Edgington at the head of the table this year. He's the kind of guy who rolls up his sleeves and gets the work done. So, Chris, thanks again for joining us from your home in St. Ansgar, Iowa. And for the very last time as the NCGA President. Chris Edgington: Absolutely, it's a pleasure to be here. And when you reflect back on the year and where we went and how it happened, and some of the things that happened that really weren't on the radar, Dusty, when you asked me a year ago, \"Where were we going and what were we going to do?\" And on some of those, we had some success, but a muted type of success that a lot of Growers probably don't totally grasp. And actually in one case, maybe even the general consumer. It's been a really great year to be at the helm as far as the honor and the tradition that come with this organization and the people involved in it. And I will look back and say, \"I really enjoyed that.\" Jon Doggett: So Chris, I wanted to come back to something you said when we talked a year ago and we've talked about it a lot and your top priority was facilitating the teamwork that supports the corn industry. So why is that so important to you and how has your understanding of that teamwork evolved over the last year? Chris Edgington: Well, not to be a total sports metaphor type of guy, but one individual in agriculture, for the most part, can't accomplish much. You have to have people working with you. And in our organization, National Corn, can't get it all done all by themselves. They need the states to work with them, we need the agri industry to work with them. And quite honestly, we need the other commodity groups to work with them. And one of the small successes I had this year was starting something for the very first time. And that was a National Commodities President meeting along with policy people. And I think it's something that went over really well and we are probably going to continue that as they move forward. And will it make any headlines? No, absolutely not. What it was, was the opportunity for that networking, that teamwork piece. As we move forward to the farm bill, that's going to be front and center. Chris Edgington: There's been some things going on there already, but there'll be a lot more go once this election gets out of the road and we get into a new Congress after the first of the year. And laying the groundwork with other commodity presidents about how we can work together on so much of this is something that I think will pay dividends for us as a Corn Organization going forward. Jon Doggett: So let's take a look at a few of those critical, but maybe not so flashy wins. And you've talked about a couple of them that we've racked up over the year. And what would you say in your mind as you look back at 2022, what were the most meaningful wins that you think NCGA has achieved? Chris Edgington: There's probably a couple that come to forefront. One of them actually started before I was president and that involved with the Estate taxes and a meeting that goes back to May 2021 or April 2021, I forget, with Congressman Scott and talking about stepped up basis and Estate tax changes and small business implications that could have been very devastating to not just agriculture, but any other small family run business in the United States and the coalition we built around that. And then for those things to not happen, we kept that all at bay, in the various tax provisions and tax fundings and tax things that came out of Congresses as they were trying to still recover from COVID. We kept that increased tax deal at bay, very quiet, most people don't think about it. That was a big one. Chris Edgington: And another one that has gotten some attention, but it's the whole deal around tariffs and not so much the tariffs on nitrogen fertilizer, which we did have a win on, and the phosphate is still out there and there's still potential for that. But more of the win that the general consumer can make a difference. More of the win that the general consumer should maybe be... They call it means tested because a lot of these tariffs are countries versus companies or countries versus countries. And they never asked to the general consumer who in the end is the one that pays the final bill. The nitrogen fertilizer, yep, they went through consolidation, but they only talked to the distributors about it. They never really talked to the farmer, \"What do you think about consolidation?\" They never talked to the farmer about supply and demand on our inputs in any type of level. Chris Edgington: We now have their attention. They, as an industry are talking directly to farmers. Still, maybe not as much as we would like, in comparison to some of our other industry partners that we work with weekly, but we're making progress in an area that we've never been before. Jon Doggett: So one of the other issues, and I was reminded to the timing of this just yesterday at the very height of the gasoline price situation this year. The administration comes out with an emergency fuel waiver for E 15, so that we could actually use E 15 year round for this last driving season. How big a deal was that? And what are you hearing from other farmers and ethanol plants and other folks? What are you hearing about that E 15 situation? Chris Edgington: It was a great win for the consumer. One of the biggest things that happened ism people were asking, where can I get it? Where are the pumps at, to supply E 15 and how do I access it? Because it was worth 50, 60, 70 cents a gallon difference in some markets, compared to traditional fuel. And so the consumer was actively looking for it. So the ethanol industry was happy about that. They had maintained that demand during the summer, the corn farmer was happy, because the grind continued to go and move bushels. The cattle industry was happy because the supply of distillers grains going into the livestock feed was unabated because of the demand for ethanol and the process that happened. And we really have to thank our friends at the USDA and interestingly enough, our friends at the EPA who both were behind that decision, they totally supported that. Not only are elected officials, but also some of those appointed officials that recognized A, ethanol is good for the environment. And B, we could save the consumer a significant amount of money during the summer driving season. Jon Doggett: A second hand, I heard a week or two, or maybe it was a month ago from a fairly senior official in the Biden Administration said that, a lot of people were astounded that the president who had some real misgivings about E 15 early on, actually took to the administrator, the EPA administrator and said that was a really good decision. So when a good decision goes. Well, the president likes it when E 15 is 60 cents a gallon cheaper, consumers like it as well. So the other went from the administration on ethanol was for the first time, since the last energy bill was passed. We got the whole 15 billion gallons in the renewable fuel standard in an RVO. That was a big one too. Chris Edgington: Yeah, it's a big one for a couple ways. A, it's big for current because of the fact that it's the target and the number we've been trying to get to and we got there. But also it's a great indicator of the future and where we need to be. And the fact that as the EPA looks to make more RVO numbers moving forward, that they know that that number is achievable, attainable and reliable. And so they don't have any real misgivings about using that number as they move forward. And one of our goals obviously is as we continue to produce more corn is to make sure that our demand sectors are alive and well and working at full speed. Jon Doggett: So shifting maybe to an area that's a little bit more sticky, we all know that the Congress hasn't achieved a lot of things in the Ag space this year. But the introduction of the next generation fuels act in the United States Senate, that's been in the House, it lowers fuel prices, it reduces carbon emissions, it deals with our energy security, it's a big thing for rural economies. What do you see for the next year when we have a new Congress and reintroduce the legislation in both chambers, we're going to lose Cheri Bustos, the House member, who's been the champion on the House side. How you feel about where we're going to be this next year on the next generation Fuels Act? Chris Edgington: Really positive. I think we've got a great opportunity here. The fact that it's introduced in both the Senate and the House and by both parties is bipartisan introduction, shows both parties find value in this. They find value in the energy security that comes from having a homegrown fuel. They find value in the climate improvements that come from having a homegrown fuel. You can look at studies from Harvard or studies from the Department of Energy or Argonne labs. And they all show that ethanol is part of this solution for energy in the United States, has been and will continue to be. Not only that, but we continue to develop byproducts for that industry that other consumers are wanting. Distillers grains comes to the top of mind, but there are other byproducts that have come out of that process. So the fact that we've got senators and representatives, both chambers, some of those people will be around next year. Chris Edgington: And that they've introduced, it means they're expecting to get it moving forward. Senators just don't introduce bills to watch them hang in the wind, they want things to get done. The house has a little bigger challenge sometimes just because of the dynamics of that chamber and how fast sometimes they turn people over, because they're getting elected every two years and the Senate's a little more stable. But we've got champions in both chambers, in both parties and they recognize that it is part of the solution, whether you're talking about climate, whether you're talking about energy, whether you're talking about economics for the consumer. Jon Doggett: It's a win-win and amazing opportunities there, if we can continue to push and continue to get that political support. And the bipartisan nature of the Senate bill was really part of the thing that gives me some hope that we can really get something done next year. Dusty Weis: You know, Chris, as you talk about building up support for the next generation fuels act here, everything in DC is all about leverage. And you talked earlier about some of the things about 2020, that weren't really on our radar. I don't know about you, but I didn't have war in Eastern Europe on my bingo sheet for 2022. But I remember back in early May, at that point Russia's invasion of Ukraine had been going on for about two months then. And here in the upper Midwest, my wife and I were driving through some unplanted corn fields because it was too cold and too wet to get out and plant yet. And I looked at her and I said, \"Boy, if those farmers can't get out there and get their crops in the ground soon, we're going to have a real famine on our hands, globally speaking.\" Dusty Weis: Now we did, we got out into the fields, we got those crops planted and it's looking to be a pretty successful harvest all across north America with a few challenges here and there, but not to try to force a silver lining on this war in Ukraine and everything, but did this new attention to food security, remind people how important agriculture is? Chris Edgington: You know, Dusty, it did and that's an interesting topic area. We probably could do that all on one whole episode. Most consumers are very busy, they got their head down, they're doing their job. They're trying to take care of their family. They want to know when they go to the grocery store, to the gas station, that they can just fill up, buy what they want and go, because they've got other things on their plate that they're trying to deal with. And when you get a situation like the war in the Ukraine, it obviously heightens that whole thought process. Even for here in the US, where food security is probably not really a major concern in a lot of instances because we are such an agronomically agronomy production juggernaut, when it comes to producing commodities of all forms in a lot of places. And so we're going to have stuff in our shelves, but there's other places in the world that aren't, and that's still playing out today about some of the issues where the Ukrainian products were going in Africa or the Middle East and some of the challenges they got. Chris Edgington: And when you have countries that count their boats, because of the amount of wheat they need for the amount of bread and they strategically plant it out for, we always carry this much wheat on hand, in case there's a boat issue or this or that and that got disrupted, food security does come right to the front. We've got a lot of allies in agriculture and people don't always look at it this way. But we've got South America, we've got parts of France and some of the other parts of Europe, we've got Canada, we've got South Africa, we've got China, India, and everybody has been very focused this year on making sure they could get as much crop as they could because we don't want anybody in the world to go hungry. Hunger in the world creates unrest, civil unrest. And so yes, it did bring a heightened awareness. Chris Edgington: Fortunately, we got our crops in the ground. We're going to have a pretty decent crop year. Mother nature is still one of the biggest wild cards that we have no control over. And she wasn't happy with some of my friends' farther West, apparently, because she was pretty hard on the amount of rain she gave them. But we'll still have a decent crop here, we're still feeding livestock. We're still producing eggs and broiler meat and the vegetable world and all the other things that we enjoy are still alive and well. But it absolutely heightens the awareness when you have a war going on in what is a large agricultural region. Jon Doggett: There's another fight we have brewing and it's the battle to protect Ag chemicals, particularly in this case, atrazine from the proposed regulation, by the EPA. Chris, why is this such an important crop protection tool and what can Growers do to make sure it stays in the toolbox? Chris Edgington: Well, let's start with what they can do. NCGA has got a Call-to-Action going on to the EPA to talk about this regulation and why we find it detrimental. So why is it detrimental? Atrazine has been around for over 60 years and it is in over 60 corn chemistry products because of the synergistic effect that it provides. We're able to use a little bit of atrazine in some sort of formulated product that allows us to not have to use full label rates on some of these other products. It's in over 90 products across the country. Chris Edgington: Sorghum/milo has some different chemicals that they use compared to corn. It's just a valuable tool in the toolbox. It's been the most studied product that we probably have ever utilized. It has always come back positive. But what they're trying to do today is take, then they measured in parts per billion in water, which is currently the standard is at 15 and they want to drop it to 3.4. That will affect over 70% of the corn acres in the country with the amount of product they're able to use. Which means that the synergistic effects will go away and they'll be using more of some other product and probably not with as good of effect. And they want us to do more no-till, more strip-till, more cover crops. And yet they want to take tools out of the toolbox that help us manage our farms through that. Chris Edgington: Glyphosate is another one, that they keep trying to take that out of the toolbox. Glyphosate and atrazine have revolutionized corn production as well as other crops. And we will go back to more tillage. I mean, if we don't have the proper chemistries to be able to utilize because tillage also kills weeds, but what does tillage bring? It brings soil erosion from wind, it brings soil erosion from water and it's not beneficial to the soil. So it is a big deal. And so our farmers have the opportunity to reach out, send a response to the EPA, talk about why this affects their farm, what they will have to change in their farming operation. I believe our Call-to-Action goes till the 6th or 7th of October, as the EPA has a comment period. And it's very easy for people to just go to ncga.com and find the link. Dusty Weis: I think we'll make it even easier than that, Chris. We'll just take that link and put it right in the episode description. So anyone listening can just click on that link and get your public comment filed right now. Chris Edgington: Perfect. So it's a big deal, Jon. Jon Doggett: It is a huge deal and I went to the link a week or so ago and it did personalize it just a little bit. I think it took maybe 35, 40 seconds. So it's pretty easy to do, but it's really important that it gets done. So again, Chris, thank you for your leadership in pushing this really hard because we need to have as many comments. We need to have as much excitement about this as we possibly can. And I know that you've worked hard with your fellow Growers to get them to that spot. Chris, is your term winds down, Tom Haag from Eden Valley, Minnesota is getting set to succeed you as President. And he was your Vice President last year and you got to know him a little bit better and maybe mentored him a bit. What advice have you given him? Chris Edgington: Well, if you know Tom, you know that Tom's got a mind of his own, comes from living in Minnesota and farming him with the cold tundra. One of the things that you have to remember is assume good intent on most issues and topics and try to find the background story if somebody is really not happy with what's going on or where you're at. And how does that affect the issue that they presented to you or the challenge they brought. And at the end of every day, try to feel good that you accomplished what you could for yourself and for the organization, but lean on people as well. And Tom has some coaching experience in his background and he's another guy that believes in the team. He believes that we get way more done, if you work together as a unit. Chris Edgington: He will lean on myself, he'll lean on Harold, he'll lean on the staff and the other Grower members. He'll lean on the state of Minnesota, just like I've done some things with Iowa. And part of it is, don't totally expect what you're going to get to have happen because you don't know. I had a past President send me a text the other day and said, \"What would you call your accomplishments?\" And that particular president got to go to the white house three times for bill signings. Very unusual circumstances, that's not going to happen to me. It wasn't on my list of have to dos because I knew that the timing was not right, it's an opportunity of circumstances. The other thing is, you need to be prepared for the unexpected because we've had several things come up, many of them positive, a few of them not, that were unexpected when the year started. And you just have to work your way through it and resolve that you feel good about the decisions you made because you're trying to look at the organization as a whole, not at any one individual or issue, in particular. Jon Doggett: So legacy is a word that comes up in the world of agriculture or just about any part of society. So when you were starting out as NCGA President a year ago, you said your goal was to just leave it better than you found it. So if you look back on the last year and you've done a little of that, how do you feel about that legacy leave for Tom and the rest of the organization? Chris Edgington: From the organization side, I definitely think that we are in a better spot. We have streamlined some things. Our communication between Grower leaders is better. We got out of COVID, that was part of it. We actually had a year full of meetings. When I look back to what Jon and Kevin had to go through, and both of them had to deal with COVID, where things were completely shut down. And we basically just like the rest of society, we have figured out, we're having meetings. We will show up, people are going to be there now, will somebody be missing? Yeah, it happens. So some of that happened from the Grower side and it would depend on the Grower you ask. Some of them feel that this fertilizer deal is just driving them nuts. We haven't done anything for fertilizer, so we haven't done anything right. The fact that corn is still six and a half dollars or more, and soybeans are $13 or $14. It has helped with that fertilizer situation. Chris Edgington: But did I get everything done? Did it all come out smooth and sailing? No, I knew it wouldn't. You always hope for that. I became President of another organization a few years ago and I thought it was going to be a pretty calm and safe year. And then that local organization's pack made its announcements of who it endorsed. And that all blew up in my face like you wouldn't believe. But what I do feel good about Jon and you and the staff are such a huge part of all this is our communication, our transparency, our decision making process is solid. We work through issues, we resolve things, we communicate with each other. It's always interesting, I am fairly engaging, I will ask people questions, even when they're wanting to be silent and people have gotten used to that. But they've also gotten used to, it's okay for Growers and staff to talk on a regular basis on whatever topics they're working on versus only during board time or only during special meetings. Chris Edgington: If you got a question in the middle of the day, I picked up the phone and called whoever it was, because if I tried to remember for a special time, I forgot it, because something else came up to replace it, probably. That to me, shows an organization that's working well together, where people understand that we're all working towards the same thing. We've all got different roles and different responsibilities, but at the end, we are working to produce more corn, create more demand, more markets, and be productive for both our Grower members, as well as the 300,000 checkoff members that invest their funds into our programs, to work on projects that are dear and near to the Grower leaders. Jon Doggett: It is a really nice legacy that you're leaving and you should be proud of it. And one of the other things you should be proud of Chris is the support that you've had from your family. So what are you looking forward to the most about getting to spend a little bit more time back on your farm in St. Ansgar, Iowa? Chris Edgington: Well, obviously one of the things is just getting back into the farming operation that I never really left, but I kind of was stepping sideways while they were trying to move forward. And I really enjoy producing crops. I keep learning more about what I'm doing and how to do it. And the fact that I share that with my dad, my brother, my son, our daughter, sometimes. And then all the other extended family. My wife has been a huge supporter. She will enjoy me being home a little bit more. Although, she does know that I still have one year of quite a bit of travel and activities. And Jon, when I got into this and my lady asked me a month ago, how I got to be in this seat and it took me two and a half hours. Now there were a couple interruptions and a few things. But it all goes back to the premise who better to talk about agriculture and production, than the actual people doing the producing of it. Chris Edgington: And I get thanked a lot. I got thanked this weekend, after I got done being chewed out by a guy on a topic, but I got thanked for being on the radio, for talking about our issues, for being engaged in that and taking care of that. And producers, a lot of them don't want to do it. They don't want to leave the farm, they don't want to get on the radio or write a letter to the editor or anything. And I guess I kind of got past that a long time ago. I really enjoy telling Ags story. I really enjoy talking about all of the innovation and all of the things we do. And I just got off of a call with a bunch of companies. And one of the things they're talking about is sustainability and environment. And they all got all these goals, but very few of them actually have Grower members on any form of advisory council trying to help them talk about practices. Chris Edgington: They might have a test farmer, they might have this, but they actually don't spend a lot of time across the entire country with Grower members, Grower leaders, that may or may not be their suppliers, because one of the challenges we face and I've said this in front of Congress, around the farm bill is, we produce corn in 48 states, or maybe it's 49. It's Texas to Minnesota, it's California to Maryland and Maine in the domestic plus obviously Hawaii and if you want to throw Puerto Rico in there. But the weather's not the same, the soil's not the same, the markets aren't the same. And so when somebody wants to paint the entire ag corn production area with one brush, they do not understand what's really going on. And some of our companies that we sell to, have some of those same challenges. Chris Edgington: They are getting better, I will say that, but they want to paint corn production is with one brush. So whether you're in South Texas or Northern Minnesota, you guys should be able to do it exactly the same. That would be fine if mother nature treated them both exactly the same, but they don't. And the soils are different, you've got glacier soils in Minnesota and you got something else in South Texas. It's an interesting deal, but going home, it will be a challenge for me to be a little less outgoing at the same time. I have some goals for our operation at home that I'm probably the driver behind and some of its things that I've been exposed to. That's like, \"Yeah, we need to look into some of this stuff\". And by being home, I'll be able to implement some of those. Jon Doggett: Well, Chris, I would say having worked with you all these years, I do know that you have a lot of energy that is needing a little bit of direction, and you've always been very focused on that. So I am sure the rest of the family is going to have a few interesting moments over the next few years in translating that energy you've used for the industry to the energy that you're going to spend at home. So that ought to be a really interesting thing to watch from afar. Chris Edgington: Jon's heard me say this more than once, as I've got up and gave a few retirement type comments to people. And it is truly an honor to sit in this seat, when you walk into the National Corn Grower's office and you look at the pictures on the wall, there's not very many faces there, for an organization that's close to 60 years old. In the early years, some of those guys did this for two or three years in a row, and then maybe even came back as they were trying to get it organized. And simply, the honor to lead, what is the largest, most dynamic commodity organization in the US has been a privilege. It was not something I had on my radar 10 and 12 years ago, I can guarantee you that. Chris Edgington: And now that it's come and it's happened, it's like, \"Why would I have ever missed this opportunity to have done this and to represent American farmers both domestically and internationally\". When you travel international and you're representing agriculture in the US, it is amazing, the conversations you get in with people, because some of them have a better idea where Iowa is in the US, than some of our East or West Coast citizens. Do I get every state right, every time? No, but I do know where the Midwest is. And I do know the East coast and the West coast. So the respect that American agriculture has around the world is probably part of the reason that it feels so good to represent American agriculture around the world. Jon Doggett: Well, we've been visiting with Chris Edgington, from St. Ansgar, Iowa. And he is NCGA's outgoing president. So Chris, thank you for your service to the organization.

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is encouraging growers to join its call-to-action and submit comments to the EPA on the important role atrazine, a popular herbicide, plays in their work. The call-to-action was launched over the summer as EPA began revising its registration for atrazine. EPA is proposing a level of concern for atrazine at 3.4 parts per billion, down from the current level of 15 parts per billion. The move would significantly impair the effective use of atrazine on farms, according to NCGA. “Atrazine allows corn growers to experience higher yields using less land with fewer inputs, which is good for the environment and saves growers money,” said Brooke S. Appleton, vice president of public policy at the National Corn Growers Association. “Reducing the effectiveness of this important herbicide will hinder the work of farmers and turn the clock back on our conservation efforts.” Since the organization launched the call to action on July 20, more than 3,000 growers have taken action through NCGA’s website. The response on this issue needs to reflect its importance to our industry, according to NCGA leadership. EPA’s open comment period closes on October 7. You can join NCGA’s effort by clicking here.",

NCGA’s comments came after Taylor testified before the Senate Agriculture Committee as it considers her nomination. “Alexis is someone with a deep understanding of agriculture, and she is widely respected by policymakers on both sides of the aisle,” said Brooke S. Appleton, vice president of public policy at the National Corn Growers Association. “We are very excited by the prospect of having someone of Alexis’s caliber serving in this role.” During her testimony, the nominee told the committee that “ag is not just what I do, but who I am.” Taylor, who currently serves as director of the Oregon Department of Agriculture, has served as a policy expert on ag issues for several members of Congress and managed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services. An Iraq veteran, Taylor grew up in Iowa on her family’s 160-year-old farm. Once approved by the committee, Taylor’s nomination will move to the Senate floor for a vote. NCGA encourages swift approval of her nomination.",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) hosted a group of Agriculture Future of America (AFA) student delegates in the Washington D.C. office as part of AFA’s Policy Institute. NCGA staff provided a tour and overview of the work the organization does and led discussions around how the national and state associations work collaboratively across the country to increase opportunities for America’s corn farmers. NCGA staff were able to engage with the student delegates through different workshop and roundtable opportunities including an office tour followed by an “NCGA 101” to help provide students with some visibility of all of the different opportunities and skillsets needed within a trade association. Brooke Appleton, NCGA Vice President of Public Policy, participated in AFA’s ‘Careers in Policy’ roundtable, Angus Kelly, Director of Public Policy, Trade and Biotechnology, was a panelist for the ‘Foreign & Domestic Affairs’ discussion, and Michael Granché, Market Development Manager, facilitated the ‘Leadership Competency Connection’ session on Tuesday. “AFA does incredible work, helping equip the next generation of agriculturalists with the tools and networking experience they’ll need to have successful careers and impact positive change,” said Granché. “I was fortunate enough to be one of the first Hokies from Virginia Tech to get involved with AFA during my time on campus and it strongly impacted my career trajectory! I went from wanting to be a livestock veterinarian to knowing I belonged working for farmers and helping advance the industry through association work. AFA gives students not just refinement for their soft skills but also the confidence to walk up to a stranger and tell their ag story.” Through the Membership and Consumer Engagement Action Team (MCEAT), NCGA will also be a sponsor of AFA’s Leaders Conference in November held in Kansas City, Missouri where students across the country will have a chance to network with experts from the agriculture and food industry.",

    "content": "Later this month, viewers of Cattlemen to Cattlemen on RFD-TV will get a firsthand look at the value of corn and beef exports at the Port of New Orleans. In 2021, beef and port exports accounted for 537 million bushels of corn usage. “The U.S. is the world’s leading exporter of corn and when you pair that with the success of exports of the beef industry, it is an important demand driver for corn farmers,” said National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) incoming President and Minnesota farmer Tom Haag. “Being at the Port of New Orleans for this episode was a great backdrop because of the amount of agricultural goods and product that goes out of this port.” Panel participants include Tom Haag, incoming NCGA President and Minnesota farmer; National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) President and Minnesota farmer Don Schiefelbein; NCGA Market Development Action Team Chair and Colorado corn and beef producer Troy Schneider; and Kyla Hamilton, a Texas corn and beef producer who also serves on MDAT. Special interview segments are also a part of the show this year, with Janine Mansour who is head of business development for the Port of New Orleans and Dean Meyer, Chair-Elect of the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF).

Appleton, vice president of public policy at the National Corn Growers Association. “It is critical to farmers, who are approaching harvest season, that rail service remain fully functional and reliable. The agreement, announced by the Biden administration on Thursday morning, appears to end a months-long stalemate between union leaders and the rail industry. The dispute prompted President Biden to establish a Presidential Emergency Board to broker agreement between the two sides. As the Friday deadline for agreement approached, preparations were being made for major disruptions to the nation’s rail system. NCGA, in partnership with other agriculture industry organizations, actively encouraged industry officials and members of Congress to resolve the dispute to head of a strike and rail closures.

The funding will support Farmers for Soil Health, which works to advance conservation practices to improve soil health across the U.S. The collaborative is comprised of commodity groups, including the National Corn Growers Association, American Soybean Association, the National Pork Board, and the United Soybean Board. The group also includes the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, National Association of Conservation Districts, the Sustainability Consortium, the Soil Health Institute, the Center for Regenerative Agriculture and DTN. “We are appreciative of the USDA for recognizing the important role farmers play in combatting climate change,” said NCGA Vice President of Production and Sustainability Nathan Fields. “These funds will help us identify and support practices that work for corn growers, expand the use of cover crops and build on our efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions.” The funding will help NCGA reach 30 million acres of cover crop by 2030, Fields noted, by funding cost share and technical assistance. USDA has credited the Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance, of which NCGA is a member, with providing recommendations that served as a guidepost when developing Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities.

    "title": "NCGA: Rail Disruption Would Affect Farmers, Congressional Involvement Needed",
    "content": "As the country braces for a possible large scale interruption on Friday to freight rail service over a dispute between unions and industry, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is reminding leaders that the agricultural sector relies heavily on a consistent and reliable rail service and calling for Congress’s involvement. “Rail is an essential piece of the agricultural supply chain, particularly as we approach harvest season, so any disruption to rail services would have a negative and lasting impact on our growers,” said Brooke S. Appleton, the vice president of public policy at NCGA. “Given the effect this could have on farmers and the nation’s economy, we urge both sides to do whatever it takes to resolve this issue by the end of the week. If an agreement is not reached soon, Congress needs to act.” Appleton noted that NCGA has spent the summer actively encouraging industry officials and members of Congress to resolve the dispute. NCGA has also partnered with other groups to communicate the importance of expeditiously resolving the impasse. And today NCGA and its partners sent a letter to Congress again emphasizing how critical rail is to the agricultural community and encouraging Congress to prepare to intervene. The issue began earlier this year as industry officials and union leaders failed to reach a contract agreement. As a result, President Biden established an emergency board, comprised of industry and union officials, which was charged with developing a resolution. Last month, the board recommended several resolutions, including raises for rail workers. While most unions agreed to the proposal, two of the largest unions held out, citing the need for improved working conditions for rail workers. This Friday marks the end of a 30-day cooling off period. If the two sides don’t come to an agreement, freight rail services across the country could come to a halt. Such an outcome, say experts, would have far-reaching ramifications for the supply-chain and the U.S. economy.",

    "content": "The California Air Resources Board today approved standards for model-year 2026 and later vehicles. In response to this development, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) released the following statement: “California regulators missed an opportunity to allow for more innovation and broaden low- and zero-emission solutions, additive to electric vehicles, to maximize emissions reductions while improving equity for consumers. As NCGA told regulators during the rulemaking process, constraining the vision of a zero-emission future prevents the state from tapping into the immediate and affordable environmental solutions that come from replacing more gasoline with low-carbon and low-cost ethanol, in both current and new vehicles, including new plug-in hybrids. Ethanol is on a path to net zero emissions, and NCGA will continue to work with and urge California to use all the tools in its toolbox as it addresses climate change and cuts harmful tailpipe emissions. As recent University of California, Riverside, vehicle testing for CARB found, higher ethanol blends, like E15, significantly reduced most criteria air pollutants compared to standard 10% ethanol blends.”",

    "content": "U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced today that USDA is now accepting applications for $100 million in competitive grants to increase the sale and use of higher blends of biofuels like ethanol. The funding, made available through USDA’s Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program, will help more fuel retailers and distributors offer consumers lower-cost and lower-emissions fuels, like E15 and E85, by sharing the cost to expand infrastructure such as pumps, dispensers and storage tanks. “Higher blends of ethanol, like E15 and E85, are homegrown fuels that save consumers money at the pump while cutting emissions and improving the nation’s energy security,” said Iowa farmer and NCGA President Chris Edgington. “That is why corn growers applaud USDA for investing in additional infrastructure to help more retailers reach more consumers with clean, affordable biofuels.” USDA will provide cost-share grants of up to 50% of total eligible project costs and expects to fund approximately 200 grant awards with the allocated funds. Applications will close November 21 at 4:30 ET, and interested applicants can find more information from USDA here. NCGA and state corn grower associations are also offering technical and other support for retailers interested in applying for these infrastructure grants",

    "title": "Shared Core Values through the Lens of Sustainability",
    "content": "Last week, members of National Corn Grower Association’s (NCGA) Corn Sustainability Advisory Group (CSAG) came together in Philadelphia. NCGA formed the CSAG in 2019 to proactively drive U.S. corn’s sustainability story and to build consumer trust and to grow competitive market demand. Eighteen months after its formation, in June 2021, members of the group—largely corn farmers from across the U.S.— launched the U.S. Corn Sustainability Goals and the first U.S. Corn Sustainability Report. CSAG members were involved at every step of the process and made all decisions, including setting U.S. corn’s 2030 environmental sustainability goals. Since the launch of the report and goals, the advisory group has grown and now includes grower representatives from NCGA’s Ethanol, Market Development, Member & Consumer Engagement, Sustainable Ag Research and Stewardship Action Teams; 2 state staff and the 5 national staff leads for each of the four Action Teams; plus, an ex-officio member from the NCGA Corn Board, bringing the group to a total of 17 members. With the environmental goals solidified and launched, CSAG came together to begin formulating the next steps for impacting positive, authentic change in the arenas of economic and social sustainability. FMC Corporation graciously hosted the advisory group at their corporate headquarters; the opening, given by their own Global Sustainability Director Rachel Greengas, outlined the approach and goals of their company vision: Greater than Green. Next in the agenda lineup, social sustainability panelists, Roxi Beck from The Center for Food Integrity, and John Fowler, professor at Oregon State University and chair of Maize Genetics Cooperation, Inc. Committee on Outreach, Diversity, Inclusion and Education (CODIE), offered up concrete ideas and examples surrounding social trust and relationship-building. To round out the day, Shelby Meyers from the American Farm Bureau Federation gave a comprehensive overview of environmental and economic sustainability progress being documented through Farmers for a Sustainable Future. CSAG spent the second day in open discussions and brainstorming paths forward to appropriate and achievable benchmarking, milestones and goals. The group will reconvene in the fall of 2022 to continue progress. To learn more about NCGA’s commitment to environmental sustainability, visit Growing a More Sustainable Future.",

    "title": "Meet Corey Schultz, NCGA Research Ambassador",
    "content": "University of Georgia Bioinformatics doctoral student, Corey Schultz has focused on finding way to improve yields by understanding how corn interacts with beneficial microbes. Through the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) Research Ambassador program, Corey has recognized farmers’ concerns and learned how to proactively communicate research results. With a saturated market of beneficial-bacteria products, Corey began to realize that different corn lines reacted differently to the same microbes. This concerning realization led Corey to study both how microbes affect corn and how corn affects microbes. “I used three different growth-promoting microbes on a variety of genetically-diverse corn lines in the greenhouse. I found variable growth promotion among the different types of corn, with some corn lines showing improved growth above ground, some below ground, and some not responding at all,” shares Corey, concluding that the best way to tailor microbes depends on the corn variety. To understand corn’s influence on microbes, Corey designed a cocktail that increases potassium intake. The purpose of this solution was to identify the microbes corn inherited during stressing times. The data from this experiment helped Corey create a more beneficial environment for corn by first understanding microbial needs. As a part of the Research Ambassador program, Corey was able to learn more about the impact his research will have on growers. The opportunities that came with being a part of the program has opened his eyes to the diversity of the corn industry. “As someone with no prior agriculture background, learning about the life of farmers, economics, and politics of corn has been one of the most valuable experiences of my PhD. Understanding the impact of my work and the field outside of academia has been important,” notes Corey. “And I just plain had fun meeting with vendors, producers, and the wonderful people at NCGA.” Corey began his studies at Clemson University where he earned his Bachelor of Science in Genetics and a minor in Biology. Throughout his schooling, Corey has developed a passion for scientific communication and diversity awareness. He serves as an officer to the Athens Science Café, which brings together his two passions. The NCGA Research Ambassador program was developed by the Sustainable Ag Research Action Team and supported by Valent. The program is designed to create a network of young leaders passionate about the agriculture industry. Participants are given the opportunity to interact with corn growers, participate in Capitol Hill visits, attend NCGA meetings and connect their lab to the farm.",

    "title": "EP. 37 - UAN Fertilizer Tariffs Rejected by the International Trade Commission: A Big Win for Growers",
    "content": "Two key players who argued their case on behalf of NCGA discuss the win and what it means for farmers. Over the last several years, tariffs and trade have been a major pain point for growers. But this summer, the NCGA has helped bring home a huge win for America’s farmers in a recent International Trade Commission case involving proposed tariffs on imported Urea Ammonium Nitrate fertilizers. So in this episode, we'll talk to Andy Jobman, a Nebraskan corn farmer, and Jared R. Wessel, an attorney with Hogan Lovells in Washington, D.C. These two played major roles in arguing NCGA's case at the ITC hearings. Andy and Jared will discuss how they argued their case, why this win was so important, and what the industry needs to do next to continue to fight unnecessary trade restrictions. DIRECT SHARE LINK: https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ncga?selected=PDM7121861421 TRANSCRIPT Andy Jobman: The fact that CF industries said that farmers aren't their customers and that they're going to apply whatever they need to raise a crop regardless of price, I think spits in the face of the American farmer. I think we threw a punch back here and said, \"Hey, you're not giving us the due credit that we deserve.\" Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the national corn growers association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host association CEO, Jon Doggett from the fields of the corn belt to the DC beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: Over the last few years, tariffs and trade have been a major pain point for growers. So we couldn't be more pleased to tell you that the national corn growers association has helped bring home a huge win for America's farmers in a recent case involving imported urea ammonium nitrate fertilizers. Dusty Weis: In this month's episode, we'll hear from two key players in NCGA's case before the international trade commission and discuss what it means and how the win is going to help growers bottom lines. But if you haven't yet make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also, make sure you follow the NCGA on twitter @nationalcorn and signup for the national corn growers association newsletter at ncga.com. Dusty Weis: And with that it's time to once again, introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the national corn growers association and Jon it's a hot summer, we're trying to keep cool here and maybe cool some tempers down here. We're also celebrating a recent win on fertilizer tariffs with the international trade commission. What can you tell us about that? Jon Doggett: You know, Dusty, it's nice to get a win in the summertime when it's so hot or anytime, but certainly the fertilizer issue has been an important thing in our industry for the last year or so. And just recently the international trade commission rejected a petition by CF industries, a fertilizer company in the US to place duties on urea ammonium nitrate fertilizers imported from Russia and Trinidad and Tobago. Jon Doggett: This decision's going to prevent fertilizer prices from going up even more in this coming planting season. And that's a big, big win, but we need a few more wins on this front, but two of my guests today played a major role in this decision and I want to thank them and I want to welcome them. First of all, welcoming Andy Jobman a Nebraska corn grower and Jared Wessel. Jared's an attorney with Hogan Level here in Washington, DC. Jon Doggett: Now Andy spoke to the commission on behalf of the national corn growers association at a hearing in June. And Jared's an expert on these kinds of trade cases and he represented NCGA in the legal proceedings. So welcome gentlemen, let me start by asking you how you came to be involved in this issue, Andy, and why is this so important to Andy Jobman, a corn grower for Nebraska? Andy Jobman: Yeah. Well, thanks Jon, for having me. Really, it came about a few years ago, actually it started with some phosphorous problems that we had at that point, and we are still fighting at this point with another company called Mosaic. Nebraska brought a resolution to our corn congress session that asked for an investigation and some research into what was going on with the increase in phosphorous fertilizer prices. And a year later, about, CF industries who like you just described is involved in the nitrogen fertilizer side of things, took a page right out of Mosaic's playbook and asked to have tariffs placed on imports. Andy Jobman: One thing led to another and all of a sudden we're paying higher prices for phosphorus fertilizer, paying higher prices for nitrogen fertilizer. And really the only really reason behind that is corporate greed, right? These companies have huge control over the market. Some would argue it's a monopoly and you have a big company like that, that tries to limit competition then there's really no control over price. And so prices skyrocket, and it's been a long fight over the last few years. We've had a lot of good input from our producers across the country that are up in arms over what's going on with higher prices. As a producer, we really have no other place to turn. We only have a few places we can buy fertilizer from, a few companies and we're kind of backed into a corner. That's a dangerous place to put somebody is backed into a corner and we really had no other options, but to fight this. Jon Doggett: Jared, you're obviously coming at this from a different angle, but certainly you've been very helpful and we appreciate your good work on our behalf. Talk about the legal side of this issue. Jared R. Wessel: Well, thanks Jon, it's a pleasure to be here today. My law firm Hogan Levels has a long history of supporting US agriculture. Actually one of our founders of the trade practice was a name that I think you'll probably recognize, Clayton Yider, who was the former USTR and also the secretary of agriculture. Jared R. Wessel: So the intersection of trade and agriculture's really a bit in the firm's DNA. It's also in my DNA. My grandfather was an Ohio corn farmer. He's got a couple fingers that he would like to have returned to him from some corn machinery. We've worked on a number of cases where our trading partners have brought cases against our agricultural exports, everything from corn to ethanol and DDGs as well. Jared R. Wessel: When the US fertilizer producers started bringing these trade cases really trying to keep foreign imports of fertilizer out, we were a natural fit to help both the importers, as well as the farming community to fight back before the various agencies that hear these type of cases. Jared R. Wessel: So in the particular case we're talking about, and I'll just call it the UAN case, because that's easier to pronounce. We helped Andy prepare for the hearing before what's called the US international trade commission and the US international trade commission is a group of five independent adjudicators who decide if the import's coming from Russia, as well as Trinidad and Tobago, if they're harming the US industry, which in this case was CF industries. Jared R. Wessel: Thanks to the testimony of Andy, as well as the testimony of a number of other farmers, importers and various other constituents, the commission voted 5-0 that such imports do not cause injury. So literally each and every commissioner that looked at this case decided that CF did not deserve the type of tariffs that it was advocating for. Jon Doggett: Well, and I think since Andy's on with us, we need to point out that Clayton Yider was from what state? Andy Jobman: From Nebraska and even wilder yet a little town called Eustis which is about a 10-minute drive from my house. Dusty Weis: I'll be darned, tiny little old world. Huh? Jon Doggett: It is a small world and Clayton Yider was a big, big figure in agriculture for many, many, many years. I got to know him early on in my career here in Washington and always an interesting guy to talk to. So Andy, talk about what has this done for the Jobman farm in Nebraska. How's it affected you and your bottom line and really importantly, how do you farm with those drastically increased input costs? Andy Jobman: Yeah. We went through a really crazy 18 months where we went from fertilizer prices being about as low as I can remember, which is great, right? You have a low input price that helps your bottom line, increases your profit margin, helps these family farms stay profitable and bring back the next generation. We went from really comfortable prices to an extremely uncomfortable position in which we had fertilizer prices that were 300% higher within 18 months. Andy Jobman: It was almost like a run at the banks that you hear about from the '30s when supply is short and all of a sudden you have your distributors telling you, \"Hey, I don't know when the next time I'll be able to sell you fertilizer is.\" All of a sudden, every farmer in the county wants to go and make a purchase to secure at least a little bit, right? Because you know the next time that offering was going to come by, the price was going to be even higher. It honestly changed purchasing behavior and purchasing timing. A lot of times my distributor and I aren't even really talking about fertilizer until the early winter months, like maybe November and December, I had my fertilizer distributor coming to me in the fall of '21 saying, \"Hey, we need to get something bought now, because I can't tell you when I will have another shipment of fertilizer.\" And I hadn't even harvested my 2021 crop yet and I was already being asked to put down a major down payment on fertilizer for next year's crop. Andy Jobman: So that really changes the dynamics when you start to think about cash flows on family farms and when you have money coming into the operation from harvest and when it needs to be going out for purchasing inputs. At the same time we have this whole issue in the Ukraine where US farmers are being asked to fill that void of production in the world to add a little bit of stability. But at the same time, we're getting asked to pay much, much higher prices to even produce that grain at the same time. Right? So we felt like we were getting both sides of the fight here. Happy to fill the void to help the rest of the world out, but at the same time, we're getting stretched really thin when it comes to what our profit margins are looking like. Jon Doggett: Well, we certainly have seen the concern express that we need to produce more food. We need to do it a more environmentally friendly fashion, we need to sequester carbon in the soils, but we're still having problems holding onto the existing tools that we have and let alone finding some new ones. Despite the win here Jared, tariffs are still in place for other fertilizers. Can you talk more about those? Jared R. Wessel: That's correct Jon, there are currently tariffs being applied on phosphate fertilizers, like MAP and DAP. In that case, in contrast to the UAN case, we lost that case at the international trade commission by a 4-1 vote. I would say that the one-vote dissent I think was a very powerful dissent. That case was brought by a company called Mosaic. That's a Florida-based company and it targets imports from both Morocco as well as Russia. Jared R. Wessel: The good thing though, is that the tariffs in that phosphate case were significantly lower than the tariffs that were potentially at stake in the UAN case. It's also important to note that decision is currently on appeal to the US court of international trade. And that's a special court in New York City that just hears trade cases. I was pleased by how the hearing went. I think the judge asked a lot of really good questions about the ITCs decision. If the judge does find that the ITC made a mistake in that case, he can remand it back to the international trade commission to essentially do a do-over of the case. If that happens, it would really be great to see the farming community, once again, come out in droves to fight against the phosphate tariffs like they did in the UAN case. Jon Doggett: Jared, let's talk about that. How susceptible are the courts there with outside comments from farmers and from others? Is it a political decision or is it a, \"Hey, we really need to know what's going on out in the countryside.\" And extra weight is given to folks that are actually physically impacted by this? Jared R. Wessel: I think it's really important for the international trade commission to hear from the farmers in these cases. In the types of cases they're going to hear from the foreign exporters, they're going to hear from a lot of the companies that import the product and then resell it. But I think at the end of the day, it's really important to hear from the farmers about the impact that this is having on their daily lives. Jared R. Wessel: I think one of the really effective things that Andy did at the hearing was to talk about the shortages in the market. The international trade commission does not want to hear that the US industry is essentially unable to serve parts of the industry when it's trying to decide if that industry needs protection from foreign imports. Jared R. Wessel: So I think one of the things that Andy did that was really effective in his testimony was talk about some of the shortages, talk about some of the demand destruction that was happening. From my perspective as somebody who litigates these cases and as somebody who worked at USTR trade policy, always incredibly important to hear from the farmers. They are important in the abstract for what they do, feeding Americans and the world, but they are a powerful lobby. They sometimes I think don't fully recognize how powerful they can be. So I think whenever there's any kind of trade issue, I think hearing from the farmers is always imperative. Jon Doggett: You know, one of the big concerns we have had with some of our friends in the fertilizer industry is that we've had some of them say, \"Farmers aren't our customer, our customer is the retailer or the co-op.\" Andy, how do farmers react to that statement that you're not the customer of the fertilizer company? I imagine you probably have picked up on that a little bit, but what was the reaction from you, and what's the reaction from your fellow growers when that gets discussed? Andy Jobman: I think the first reaction was just kind of total disbelief that there's this disconnect or this straight up arrogance, that they think that farmers and ranchers are not their customers. That'd be like saying people that purchase the corn chips that are made from the corn on my farm are not my customers, or not the people that are eventually using my product. So just a crazy comment I think, to make and one, I think that really got a lot of folks across farm country up in arms over. Jon Doggett: So this issue's played out like a... Well, not a horror movie, but maybe a suspenseful movie. The commission was going to rule against us, and then it seems that was that 11th hour change of heart. So Jared, give us again, what's that winning strategy. What's that argument that helped turn the corner on this from your perspective and how can we continue to work on that success? Jared R. Wessel: So the way these cases work is that the international trade commission makes a preliminary determination if there's a reasonable indication of injury and CF industries was able to meet that standard initially. Jared R. Wessel: After that, the ITC really digs into the case. I think the factual development testimony, et cetera, that all greatly expands into the final and it's that expansion of the information that I think really kind of turned the tide for us. I have to caveat that we haven't seen the ITCs reasoning yet. The only thing that we know is that the vote was 5-0. But just kind of observations from the hearing, I think it was really hard to see how CF industries, which again, was the only company that showed up to prosecute the case, it was really hard to see how that company was being harmed by imports. If you looked at their public financial statements and the statements that they were making to their investors, they made a billion dollars last year and they bought a billion dollars back of their own stock. That's billions with a B that's not millions. Jared R. Wessel: As somebody who's been a long time practitioner in the trade area, those numbers were astounding to me to see from a company that is essentially asking for trade relief when they're making a billion dollars of profits and buying a billion dollars back of their shares. So if you take how well CF industry was doing, and then you really contrast it with, I'd say both the inflationary environment, as well as the fact that we have 13 million children in the United States that are facing food insecurity, and you've got corn growers like Andy, who are telling the international trade commission, \"Hey, I'm having trouble getting this material in order to feed Americans and the world, essentially.\" If you contrast that, a billion dollars in profits with people just trying to do their job, but they can't get the materials to grow crops, I think it's really hard for somebody to look at that objectively and find that the US industry deserves trade protection. Jon Doggett: So why did they bring the case, do you think? Jared R. Wessel: I don't want to overly speculate about why somebody would bring a case, but I would suspect that they probably saw that Mosaic was successful in the phosphate fertilizer case and attempted to essentially tag along on Mosaic's success. Other than that, I don't have a great idea. I do think again, the case was a 5-0 decision. So they couldn't even get one commissioner, I think, to buy into the story that they were selling. Jon Doggett: So Andy, what was giving testimony to the ITC? What was that like from your perspective as a farmer from Nebraska? You're speaking on behalf of the industry, what was it like for you to do that? Andy Jobman: Can I say it was fun and scary at the same time? You know, I think back to my days in 4-H and FFA in high school, and I would've never guessed that a small town boy from central Nebraska would be testifying in the ITC court for the American farmer, basically. So it was a great learning experience. Andy Jobman: I was really taken back by the genuine interest the ITC had in what we were talking about. They asked really good follow up questions on both sides. They asked great questions to CF industries, they asked great questions to us on the other side of the argument. You could really kind of start to see their wheels turning in terms of the type of questions they were asking that were really kind of trying to get down to, like Jared said, the nut and bolt of the issue of how is these tariffs necessary when CF industries is doing so well financially. Andy Jobman: I have a background in agronomy and crop science. I think that brought some really valid points forward when I talked about how producers are at this decision point where we're trying to lean down what we apply in terms of fertilizer, because it costs us so much, but there's also going to be producers out there that cut fertilizer costs just to cut them. T. Andy Jobman: Hat's going to put a huge amount of risk in terms of what we can produce as a crop, right? Because if you're stretching that crop thin on nutrients, just like if you were stretching a professional athlete on their diet, there's going to be some inherent risk there in terms of performance. So that's a major concern is if we have producers that are starting to reduce fertilizer rates, because it's just too expensive to apply, then all of a sudden we're going to have less production. If we have less production, that's going to impact food prices that are already going up, because of inflation in general. Andy Jobman: That's a really delicate position that we put not only our country in, but also the rest of the world. So high prices are the cure for high prices. I think this is a really good example of that. That farmers are going to leverage technology to try to make that pound a fertilizer go that much farther and the fact that CF industries said that farmers aren't their customers and that they're going to apply whatever they need to raise a crop regardless of price, I think spits in the face of the American farmer. I think we threw a punch back here and said, \"Hey, you're not giving us the due credit that we deserve.\" Dusty Weis: Well, Jon, you described this as a suspense movie, but it sounds a lot like Mr. Jobman goes to Washington from where I'm sitting here. And definitely some Jimmy Stewart drama inherent in that. But Jared, now that the ITC has rendered its decision, what's the next step? What can we expect to see happen next? Jared R. Wessel: Two things, one, CF industries has the ability to appeal the case to the US court of international trade. In the same way that we appeal the phosphate case, they have the right to appeal the UAN case to the same court. I would just note though, the decision was 5-0, so I'm hopeful that they choose not to do that given the overwhelming signal that the international trade commission sent about the merits of this case. Jared R. Wessel: Second, CF industries has filed something with the department of commerce, which is the other government agency that runs these trade cases that we're talking about. They have essentially argued that because Russia lost its preferred trading status, that it is no longer a WTO member and because it's no longer a WTO member, they can implement the countervailing duty tariffs, even though they lost at the ITC. We don't think that has merit, but obviously that's something that we will continue to watch as the department of commerce handles that allegation by CF industries. Jon Doggett: So Andy Jobman, a lot of folks that listen to this podcast are not farmers and they're not closely tied to agriculture, so help us out. What's the difference between nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizers? What do they each do? How are they applied? What does it do to your crop? Give us a fertilizer 101 for a moment. Andy Jobman: You bet, I'll put on my professor hat and we'll take a stroll down this road. We'll try to keep it a fairly simple description, but when anybody goes out and buys a bag of fertilizer for your lawn that you want to apply, it's going to have three numbers on it. The first number is nitrogen, the second number is phosphorous and the third number is potassium. They're in that order, because nitrogen is by far the most important nutrient for most crops, for most plants. Phosphorus is kind of the second most important and potassium kind of comes in at a third and we call these are macronutrients. Right? They're the most important, the ones that are needed the most for growth, for production of grain or forage or whatever the particular crop is going to be. Andy Jobman: So nitrogen is by far what I, as a farmer, spend the most amount of my fertilizer dollars on when it comes to corn production. I would say it's almost over 50% of my total fertilizer budget is just on nitrogen. The next one is phosphorus. So these two are really, really big expenses when it comes to producing our grain crops. So when we had these tariffs put on these particular inputs, all of a sudden that made a really big portion of our budget, even bigger. That's why you saw farmers get up in arms over this so quickly. Andy Jobman: So UAN, which is the nitrogen case is a liquid form of nitrogen that we can apply. I can apply it with my planter, I can apply it with a host of different implements. I'm applying it right now through my center pivot irrigation systems to spoon feed my crop throughout the season and be as efficient as possible. Think of it like how we eat three times a day and sometimes snack in between. That's the same thing I'm doing with my fertilizer when I split apply it. It makes the use of that fertilizer so efficient, versus trying to eat all the food that I need to eat at breakfast. Right? Andy Jobman: You could never do that and make it to the time you go to bed without getting hungry. So we have all these different tools out there that farmers are using that increase the efficiency, that help us become really, really sustainable and also minimize our impact on the environment. So when we start to mess with the pricing of these unnecessarily with tariffs then all of a sudden it really changes the mindset of producers. Like I said, if it's going to be really expensive to apply nitrogen fertilizer, farmers are really going to leverage technology to try to stretch that nitrogen fertilizer unit even farther. Jon Doggett: So that plant absolutely has to have nutrients and we can apply it in a variety of ways, we can apply it in a variety of forms. Right now you're applying it through your center pivot in the water that you're applying to that crop. So I have heard from farmers over the years, well, granddad, it took two pounds of nitrogen for a bushel of corn and then dad used a pound in a quarter to pound and a half. And now a lot of growers are below a pound. In your part of Nebraska, what's the historical movement of that reduction? How much are you applying versus how much was applied 10, 20, 50 years ago? Andy Jobman: You know, when I was growing up, I would say that 1.2 to one and a half pounds of nitrogen per bushel was kind of a standard. When I was in college, you saw a lot of research that was starting to suggest getting closer to that one pound per bushel. Now with how we're spoon feeding and split applying the nitrogen, most years, we're less than a pound of nitrogen per bushel. I would say I try to plan around 0.85 to 0.9 pounds of nitrogen per bushel. I think you'll continue to see that creep down as technology improves, as our corn hybrids become more efficient through advanced breeding practices. Andy Jobman: It's just like anything else, especially like sports, high-performance athletes are always trying to beat that world record, whether you're talking about swimming in the Olympics or trying to beat that four-minute mile, everybody's trying different things, whether it's technology, different diets, and the same thing is true with corn farming and farming in general, I would say. We're always trying to beat our previous personal best. Jon Doggett: So that old adage sums good more is better doesn't really apply to application of fertilizer. Andy Jobman: No, definitely not. I would say more importantly is the placement of it. We can place things on a sub inch accuracy level now with our GPS equipment and then the timing of it too. A lot of this equipment allows us to apply it precisely next to the plant, but also precisely in terms of timing of when that plant actually needs it. Jon Doggett: How much good does it do you to have that fertilizer that you've applied down the creek down the river and in the Gulf of Mexico? Because I keep hearing these farmers purposefully pour on the fertilizer and they don't care if it goes down to the Gulf, do you care about whether it goes down to the Gulf or not? Andy Jobman: Yeah, absolutely. If I have a pound of fertilizer going down the river or blowing off in erosion, it's not doing what it was supposed to do. It's money leaving my pocket, money leaving my operation. It costs money to grow a crop. It costs money to run these farming operations and we don't take our inputs lightly. You'll see a lot of guys, I think probably would rather err on the side of under applying rather than over-applying simply because they're looking at the financial side of the situation. So yeah, the claim that farmers are just dumping it on and trying to maximize yield, we're certainly trying to maximize yield, but we certainly want to do it on an economic and environmental sustainable way. Jon Doggett: So of your major costs, your land cost, your equipment cost, your input cost, where's fertilizer fit into that ranking? Andy Jobman: Oh, when you're talking about purchasing land, land is always very expensive to acquire. They're not making any more of it and there's less farmable acres out there all the time just due to urban expansion and all that. Fertilizer's pretty high. It's probably one of our top two or three expenses. Jon Doggett: Jared, we're about to run out of time, but I want to ask you, what would you say to that government official or that regulator considering tariffs or regulations right now on fertilizer and the import of fertilizer? What would you say or what have you been saying? Obviously, you've been en engaged in this conversation quite a bit over the years. What do you tell them? Jared R. Wessel: Well, Jon, it's a pretty simple story for me and I think for the farming community. Any official face is a question of, do you want to increase food insecurity and contribute to the inflationary environment only to increase the profits of fertilizer companies that are already making frankly obscene profits? I think the answer to that question is clearly no, and we're going to fight to make sure that regulators and others know that trade off. I began talking about Clayton Yider I have his biography in front of me. That's going to be my summer reading and it's Clayton Yider rhymes with fighter. And I think in that spirit, anybody who tries to blame imports for any problems in the US fertilizer industry, I think is dead wrong and we'll continue to make that case going forward. Jon Doggett: Well, Jared Wessel, and Andy Jobman, thank you so much for being with us today. You know this has been an important issue in NCGA, I'm really proud of the work we've done. We came out swinging on the nitrogen front, on the phosphorus front. We're going to continue to do that. As we come out swinging and as we come up pushing back really hard, we have to go to the resources we have and we have a great resource in Jared and his firm and all the good legal work that has been done on corn grower's behalf by them. Jon Doggett: Then of course we have to go to our strength and our strength is our grassroots. It's the farmers out there who can come in and talk about what it means to their farm, to their family, to their community, to their ability to produce food and fiber and fuel for this world that is needing it so much. Jon Doggett: So thanks to both of you for being part of that big fight that we've been engaged in and we're going to continue to be engaged in that.

    "content": "Matthew Runyon is a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Illinois at Urbana – Champaign and is a part of the National Corn Growers Association's (NCGA) Research Ambassador Program. After seeing how drought affected his family’s farm, Matthew sought to find sustainable ways to improve yield during dry times. Matthew focused his research on aquaporins, which are proteins that help facilitate water movement, as well as other small molecules like CO2, between plant cells. By characterizing mutants with altered aquaporin expression profiles, Matthew hopes to change water-use efficiency (WUE) and photosynthetic parameters. “In principle, overexpressing CO2-permeable aquaporins should increase the rate of carbon uptake,” shares Matthew. “This will reduce the amount of time the stomata need to be open to allow CO2-rich air to enter the leaf, consequentially reducing the amount of water transpired.” Matthew’s research is divided into two pieces. First, he is studying the natural expression profiles of proteins in diverse corn lines and identifying patterns among different heterotic groups. Secondly, he is working to target the key pathways components of stomata in response to varying CO2 levels. He has found non-functional mutant plants take nearly 40% longer to respond to environmental conditions with a significant decrease in WUE. These findings will guide his next step in creating a hyperresponsive mutant with increased WUE. Through the NCGA Research Ambassador program, Matthew was able to advance his science communications skills. Being given the opportunity to meet growers from diverse backgrounds, Matthew had to learn how to accurately communicate his research in an easy-to-understand manner. Matthew kept his studies to the University of Illinois at Urbana – Champaign, where he earned his bachelor’s degree and is currently pursuing his PhD. He also had the opportunity to intern at the Corteva Agriscience Princeton, Ill. Research Station and AgReliant Genetics Champaign, Ill. Research Station. During his graduate career, Matthew has held both the university’s Department of Crop Sciences Dow Agrosciences Fellowship and Illinois Corn Marketing Growers Fellowship. One of his favorite things to do is training undergraduate and high school students who are working with the lab, encouraging them to consider a future career in agricultural research for themselves. The NCGA Research Ambassador program was developed by the Sustainable Ag Research Action Team and supported by Valent. The program is designed to create a network of young leaders passionate about the agriculture industry. Participants are given the opportunity to interact with corn growers, participate in Capitol Hill visits, attend NCGA meetings and connect their lab to the farm.",

    "content": "In a step forward for energy security and the nation’s consumers, Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), with the support of Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), today introduced the Next Generation Fuels Act in the U.S. Senate. “The Next Generation Fuels Act would lower fuel prices, reduce carbon emissions, and shore-up America’s energy security for the long run,” said Iowa farmer and National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) President Chris Edgington. “We are very grateful to Sens. Grassley, Klobuchar, Ernst and Duckworth for their leadership on this important issue.” The bill would establish a clean, high-octane standard for gasoline and require that sources of additional octane result in at least 40% fewer greenhouse gas emissions, allowing automakers to significantly improve vehicle fuel efficiency through advanced engines. Because corn growers have a vested interest in the future of transportation, NCGA began laying the groundwork and advocating for this policy several years ago, and the Next Generation Fuels Act, H.R. 5089, has received bipartisan support in the U.S. House of Representatives. “We have worked closely with members of the House and Senate to secure bipartisan support for this legislation,” Edgington said. “In recent months, consumers have been reminded that we need choices at the pump. The Next Generation Fuels Act would diversify our fuel supply and take greater advantage of low-cost, low-emission, and high-efficiency ethanol to give drivers affordable choices as we decarbonize and clean up transportation.” As gas prices climbed to all-time highs, NCGA has reminded policymakers that ethanol has been priced about $1 per gallon less than unblended gasoline at wholesale, and drivers are saving 30 to 40 cents or more per gallon where retailers offer E15. In late spring, the Biden administration acted to preserve access to higher blends of ethanol through the summer, ensuring consumers continue to have the low-cost, low-emission choice of E15 at the pump. The Next Generation Fuels Act would build on this progress by advancing higher ethanol blends and advanced vehicles that deliver greater emission reductions, cost savings and consumer choice.",

    "title": "Meet Dylan Shoemaker, NCGA Research Ambassador",
    "content": "Dylan Schoemaker, graduate research assistant at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, has studied the response of maize hybrids across environments as part of the Genomes To Fields Initiative, which the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) funds. Aside from his studies, Dylan was a part of the NCGA Research Ambassador program where he found value in forming scientist-grower relationships to help bring attention to issues like food security and climate change. Dylan’s research looks at understanding how corn responds to different environmental conditions and uses that information to predict hybrid performance in new environments. His research works to quantify these effects on genomes. “My research strives to understand what components of the environment—such as rainfall, temperate, and soil moisture—can be incorporated into statistical models to predict hybrid performance across diverse environmental conditions,” explains Dylan. Furthermore, Dylan’s work strives to understand the relationship between inbred ear, kernel and cob architecture and hybrid grain yield. Using these traits, Dylan hopes to better predict corn performance. Looking back on his time as an NCGA Research Ambassador, Dylan found a new value in bringing scientists and producers together to continue improving corn production. More specifically, he shared the importance each sector has on each other to see tangible progress. “As a graduate student, I am constantly caught up in the very small details on my work, making it easy to forget about the largest overall picture: helping improve the lives of producers and consumers,” shares Dylan, acknowledging the fact that this program has given him the opportunity to refocus his research and rejuvenate his passion for the industry. Dylan earned his Bachelor of Science in Plant Sciences at The Pennsylvania State University. While there, he was actively involved in the school’s agriculture department by serving as a student representative through the organization Ag Advocates, which allowed him to recruit potential ag students as well as lead a community outreach day focused on the role of agriculture in everyday life. Dylan was able to carry on his leadership abilities to the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he was elected the Agronomy Student Representative for the Plant Science Graduate Student Council.

On June 30, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that they are amending the registration of this well-studied herbicide that allows farmers to do more with less. The new level of concern for atrazine will vastly reduce the herbicide's effectiveness, hindering farmers' ability to utilize this critical tool. “Corn growers know the value of atrazine, and it is time again that we tell EPA the value of this product to our operations,” said Iowa Farmer and NCGA President Chris Edgington. “In 2016, we came together to submit 10,000 comments to the EPA, and we need that same momentum again.” Comments can be submitted to EPA here, and advocates are encouraged to include information about how the proposed level of concern would impact their individual operations.

    "content": "Thought leaders from D.C. discuss important considerations for the upcoming farm bill legislation The Farm Bill is an important piece of legislation that affects everything that is governed by the USDA. With Congress working to pass a new version for 2023, NCGA believed it was a topic worth discussing at this summer's Corn Congress in Washington, D.C. Led by NCGA's VP of Public Policy, Brooke Appleton, this discussion panel, straight from the floor of Corn Congress, includes several experienced legislators and thought leaders in the field of agriculture: Daniel Glickman, former Secretary, USDA Heidi Heitkamp, former Senator and member of the Senate Agriculture Committee Richard Fordyce, former Administrator of the Farm Service Agency Together, these four discuss important topics to consider, and the work and relationships necessary to achieve our goals in creating a farm bill that is beneficial to everyone affected by agriculture. Direct Share Link: https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ncga?selected=PDM6216457651 TRANSCRIPT Heidi Heitkamp: What advice I would give the corn growers is, you've got to build the relationships with people who care about food stamps. You've got to build the relationships with people who care about conservation. You can't expect to basically get a farm bill by just being who you are in production agriculture. Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of the corn belt, to the DC Beltway, we're making sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. I'm Dusty Weis, and on this month's episode, we're headed right into the heart of the DC Beltway with an in-depth look at one of the most consequential topics on Capitol Hill for growers, the farm bill. Dusty Weis: This piece of legislation comes up for renewal every five years. It governs everything at USDA, from commodity support to trade, nutrition to crop insurance, conservation to clean energy, and it's a hot topic in DC right now, as Congress works to pass a new version next year. But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also, make sure you follow the NCGA on Twitter @nationalcorn and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. In order to bring you the best, most recent information about what to expect from the 2023 farm bill, the National Corn Growers Association convened a special panel discussion at this summer's Corn Congress. It involved some of America's top agricultural thought leaders, and it was moderated by NCGA's Vice President of Public Policy, Brooke Appleton. Here is that discussion as it played out in DC. Brooke Appleton: All right, well, thanks so much for everyone being here today. I know you've heard from me a lot this week, but just a reminder I'm Brooke Appleton, I'm the Vice President of Public Policy for the National Corn Growers Association. And I am honored to have our esteemed panelists up here today to have the discussion of shaping the next farm bill. We've got a lot of experience on the stage, and I'm hoping to pull from that and kind of give us some good advice as we look ahead. As we debate policy resolutions, we thought it would be great to bring this panel of experts to offer insights on the next farm bill. Brooke Appleton: As you all know, the farm bill's debated about every five years, hopefully about every five years. And it touches about every single program at the Department of Agriculture. So it is important to have this discussion today. And we'll start with just a little bit more of an introduction. To my immediate left we have secretary Glickman, who served as the Secretary of Agriculture from March of 1995, until January of 2001. Under his leadership, USDA forged international trade agreements to expand US markets, and improved its commitment to fairness and equity, and civil rights. Glickman also represented the fourth congressional district of Kansas for 18 years. And we got a lot of Kansans in the room today. Daniel Glickman: Are there Kansans in the room? All right. Okay. All right. Brooke Appleton: Including as a member of the House Agriculture Committee during the 1990 farm bill. He now serves as a senior counselor at APCO Worldwide as a senior advisor to the Russell Group, and a senior advisor to the Bipartisan Policy Center, and a senior advisor to the US Global Leadership Coalition. I'm kind of tired just talking about all of that. Daniel Glickman: I can't keep a job, but it's okay. Brooke Appleton: To his left, we have Senator Heidi Heitkamp who served as the first female Senator, elected from the state of North Dakota, from 2013 to 2019. During her time in the Senate, Senator Heitkamp was a key ally on the Senate Agriculture Committee, where she helped write, negotiate and pass the 2014 and the 2018 farm bills. Senator Heitkamp is the founder of One Country, Rural Progress Summit, which provides a forum for highlighting key issues across rural America. She also does some work for the Bipartisan Policy Center, which NCGA is involved with and engaged with her as well. Brooke Appleton: Lastly, we have Richard Fordyce, who served as the administrator of the Farm Service Agency from May 2018 to January 2021. As a fourth generation soybean, corn and beef cattle farmer from Missouri, he brought the producer voice to the department's political leadership and led FSA's implementation of the 2018 farm bill. Prior to his role at USDA, Administrator Fordyce was the director of the Missouri Department of Agriculture. And he now serves as the Director of New Business Development for Agriculture at Osborn Barr Paramore, which is a full service marketing and communications agency. Brooke Appleton: So welcome everyone. Thank you so much for being here. And I feel like just kind of started off a question for the panel. Let's just start with an easy one. And just please, each of you maybe share a favorite memory that involves your work on the farm bill. And secretary, we could start with? Daniel Glickman: First of all, thanks to you, Brooke, and my colleagues on the panel and the great folks. I'm really impressed by the number of people that you have here. So I'm a senior advisor, when you get to my age, you're senior on everything. And so some of you in the room may know that, but some may not. Any event, I served in Congress and in department during slightly different times. And Heidi came later and may have some of the same experiences. But I think one of my experiences, we had a lot of fun. I served with Bob Dole and Pat Roberts, two of the people with the greatest sense of humor in the history of American politics, other than maybe myself, but that's to say... Brooke Appleton: Up for debate? Daniel Glickman: Up to debate. And so we collaborated on just about everything. And at one point in time, Roberts was chairman of the Senate Ag Committee, Dole was the Senate majority leader, and I was the secretary of agriculture and we called ourselves the Kansas mafia. We ran farm policy. We thought we did, we didn't really run it. But anyway, so I guess my greatest memory is the collaborative working together on food and agriculture policy, not just farm policy, although that was a big part of it, but also on nutrition policy. I think it was part of an era where that was more of the rule of the thing than perhaps it is now. Although I would have to say that food and agriculture policy is still more bipartisan than most areas of our public policy in this country, but it suffered a bit in recent years. And so that's my greatest memory, is getting along with my colleagues, working well and working collaboratively for American agriculture. Brooke Appleton: Okay. That's a good one. Senator? Heidi Heitkamp: Well, I don't know if it's necessarily about the farm bill, but it is about solving problems. And so, we had a horrific fire in South Dakota and North Dakota. I worked with John Thune to change the standards so that they had to consult with local people before they did a prescribed burn on the grasslands. We passed that very rapidly. I worked with Joni Ernst on redefining some of this stuff, on how we calculate and determine what you're producing. I worked with John Bozeman, who I really like. We opened up capital markets so that we could actually finance egg products into Cuba. It was the first Cuban bill that passed, I think, in 25 years. And so when you go through and you look at, as a career in the Senate, and you think, \"Where were the things that not only did you try and collaborate, but where were you successful?\" Heidi Heitkamp: I would tell you the Ag Committee. And it usually was in response to some kind of event, whether it was a fire, whether it was, I worked with Deb Fisher on standards for trucks, especially for produce that would spoil. The standards would've basically resulted in food spoilage. We were able to get things done together. RFS always been bipartisan, big rallies that we did. And so what I would say is, it is a place where you can solve problems, not just collaborate, but actually get things done. And that's my greatest memory of being in the Ag Committee. Good. Brooke Appleton: Good. And Richard, your experience probably a little different, implementing the farm bill? Richard Fordyce: Yeah, I would say so. So prior to being the administrator, prior to being the director of the Missouri Department of Agriculture, I was a full-time farmer and an advocate. So made a lot of trips to Washington, advocating on behalf of different issues related to the farm bill. What I found to be interesting when I became the administrator, and I was administrator when the president signed the farm bill, actually got to go over to the White House and see that, that was kind of cool. The work really started to begin for USDA at that point. Congress does a great job of writing a farm bill. Senator, I know I came over and saw you a few times because you didn't think we were going quite fast enough. Heidi Heitkamp: Or headed in the right direction. Richard Fordyce: Or headed in the right direction. And so what was interesting was... So to administer a farm bill, this is the law of the land for five years or six, or however long, sometimes they run. If it's in a book, it's almost 900 pages. And so, when we would start to tackle that, to administer that legislation, we literally had staff that would go through that legislation page by page, word by word, to understand what is going to remain the same, what is going to change. And then if it's going to change, we would look to congressional intent, like what did Congress intend when they wrote that language? And then certainly have lots of conversations, and get to a point where we could roll out a program. So the interesting thing was, having been on the front end of it for so many years, then being on the administration side of it, because before, as a farmer, the President signs a farm bill, we think programs will start the next day. Richard Fordyce: That's not the case, right? It takes a lot of work to get that done. So is it compliant from a budget standpoint? Is it legal? The way that we want to administer this, is it legal? And that conversation also... and this is I think certainly where you all come in and play a very important role, where we have opportunities to be discretionary, it was very helpful. Like I know a lot of NCGA folks were in my office talking about what their perception was of a certain portion of the farm bill. And that conversation needs to continue to happen after the farm Bill's passed, right? Richard Fordyce: So you guys are advocating, and ladies, are advocating for certain components to be in that farm bill. There's things that you want to be in there, and you have fostered that all along the journey. That conversation has to continue during the administration of it. And so again, my memory was being a part of different aspects over a course of 25 years to get to the finish line of a farm bill, and then seeing actually how the sausage is made when it comes to getting it administered. It is a big job. Brooke Appleton: Oh, absolutely. All right. Switching gears just a little bit. Secretary Glickman, throughout your career you have seen firsthand the cyclical nature of agriculture and energy prices. So while commodity prices right now remain higher than average, we all know we've talked about this a lot this week, that input costs are so high. And this of course, as you can imagine, has our members quite on edge and we've talked about it a lot. Do you have any advice for corn growers and policy makers who weren't farming during the 1980s farm crisis, or during previous energy crisis? Daniel Glickman: Yeah well, the inflation rate hit 9.1% last month. Much of that was in fuel. Some of that was in food, some of that was in housing and supply chains. So we are in a very volatile period of time. Now we've always been in somewhat volatile, but I think we're going to see volatility over the next several years that is going to exceed what we've seen in the past. Volatility and prices and volatility and costs. So that means crop insurance and risk management programs are even going to be more important than ever before. And they've got to be flexible to deal with the new kind of agriculture. I noticed the administration is talking about double cropping, and the use of crop insurance for double cropping. That all is very important because in a period of volatility, you've got to be able to permit diversification in agriculture, and a nimble crop insurance program will certainly do that. Daniel Glickman: I don't know what's going to happen to Ukraine, this horrendous invasion where we found ourselves dependent on two countries that... I mean, I knew they were big exporters, but I didn't realize the impact that Ukraine would have on the wheat, sunflower, soybean and corn markets in the world. Who knows what Putin is going to do if this gets into a long term deadlock situation. So all you can do for the next farm bill is to hopefully ensure that a crop insurance program is as nimble and flexible as possible, to encourage predictability and diversification in agriculture. Daniel Glickman: And I got to mention one more thing as long as I have the floor. And that is the research budget. Our public research funding and agriculture is going down in real terms, over the last 20 years. China's not, Brazil is not, we are. So how are we going to deal with a lot of these challenges like climate, weather, pests, water resources, all these kinds of things. So the corn growers have been very, very good at this and ensuring that long term future of agriculture is as much dependent on whether we have an adequately funded and staffed research arm, as we do about what next year's farm bill is going to be, looking down long term. Brooke Appleton: Great. That's good insight. Senator Heitkamp, while you were in the Senate, and now with your work with the Bipartisan Policy Center, your approach to policy has always been in a bipartisan manner. And just those examples that you made earlier, the corn growers have benefited from that, and for having those bipartisan relationships. So when you kind of look at the Ag Committee today and you think about, who are those people who we can kind of lean on and go to and still have that kind of bipartisanship across the aisle to support farmers and ranchers? Heidi Heitkamp: I think you have two leaders, both with Debbie Savino and Bozeman. They're going to set the tone. And the tone really is one of collaboration. It doesn't mean that they're always going to agree, but they can in fact provide the leadership. And the dirty little secret is, on the margins, individual members can kind of direct what their priorities are. But those two leaders are going to decide the schedule, they're going to decide what changes they're going to make to title one, if any, what they're going to do with crop insurance. The one thing that I would say is that as we look at the farm bill becoming... Well, I would say becoming after the vetos of George W. Bush, becoming basically a bipartisan accepted, we have to do this. It's almost behind the National Defense Authorization Act, the farm bill probably has some of the most staunch bipartisan support. Heidi Heitkamp: What advice I would give the corn growers is, look across the constituency groups. What will hang it up based on my judgment in that committee, and there's more and more people whose goal in that committee is to talk about food security, not necessarily production agriculture. You've got to build the relationships with people who care about food stamps. You've got to build the relationships with people who care about conservation. You've got to actually have that conversation. You can't expect to basically get a farm bill through, by just being who you are in production agriculture. And I'm going to say this, if I said it once I've said it a thousand times. Everybody who tells you that you should take the food security provisions out of the farm bill doesn't understand the farm bill, because that's what creates the collaboration, that's what creates the need. And so don't be afraid to have those conversations to build the support. Heidi Heitkamp: We know that there is a lot of interest, especially the environmental community right now about collaborating with you all on carbon issues. The corn growers have been stepped up to the plate, they were on our bipartisan policy task force, they were engaged. And our rule is, do no harm, right? So if you're looking at crop insurance, do no harm, but don't be afraid to collaborate. What I would say is the committee's bipartisan, the issues aren't always. And corn growers could take the lead in broadening the kind of discussions and collaborations with all the interest groups who are concerned about corn growers. Daniel Glickman: Can I just add something to what you said? Because I think it's... Heidi Heitkamp: No. Daniel Glickman: Can't? Okay. Heidi Heitkamp: Of course. Daniel Glickman: She's back in the legislative branch again. I'm on your side. Okay. All right. When you look at the 10 year cost estimates, over the next farm bill, 80 to 85% of it are in non-production agriculture programs in the food program. So it's about 800 billion versus about 200 billion. The numbers are... Jerry Hackstren would know what the actual numbers are, but I'm in general ballpark. And so the practical matter is that to some extent, you're not sure who the tail that is wagging which dog in this situation, but they're part of the same animal. And if you were to pull this other part out, production agriculture out, it would have much less political support. Heidi Heitkamp: And we always say, if you look at Congress and over in the House of Representatives, it's not true for the Senate, because every Senator represents a farmer, right? Somewhere along the line, even those from Massachusetts. But not every congressional district has a farmer, but they do have people who need food security and food assistance. Daniel Glickman: Yeah. Brooke Appleton: That's very good insight. And I think just switching gears just a little bit. Administrator Fordyce, the FSA county office, as you know is often the single largest touchpoint with the federal government for corn growers, but also for a lot of growers across the country. So as you think back to your role as FSA administrator, how are you able to balance the input and needs from multiple sources regarding FSA programs and policies, including the thousands of FSA staff that you had to oversee? And then also from outside groups like ours? Richard Fordyce: So I've said this a hundred times, the local county office is that touchpoint with USDA and certainly FSA. And one of the things I liked to do when I was administrator was get out in the country and go see our folks that were working in those county offices. They're certainly passionate about what they do. They are ingrained in that local community, they know the programs. A lot of times they know the programs better than the folks that were administering it in Washington. And no matter where I would go, whether I was talking to farmers or I was talking to our staff, I think that respect that folks had for the staff that were there, that were doing that good work. One of the things that we tried to do when we were there was to try to get additional appropriation for additional staffing. So you hear it, we're still hearing it, the Farm Service Agency still needs additional staff to administer programs. Without getting into the weeds on the process of hiring, hiring federal workers is a little bit... Brooke Appleton: It just takes forever. Just say that. Richard Fordyce: It takes forever. Brooke Appleton: It takes forever. Richard Fordyce: And so I know we were trying to ramp up hiring. Congress actually did give us additional funding to hire. I think they've done it again this past year. And so, it's critical that those county offices are funded appropriately, that they're staffed appropriately. And I know that those kind of efforts still continue. So anytime I was out in that local office, those folks that are working there referred to the farmers in their county as their farmers, like it's possessive. They are literally how the rubber meets the road, they're how these programs get administered. And so I had, and continue to have, the utmost respect for the folks that are working out there in the field. Brooke, I would say, and I also want to give them a lot of credit, when the pandemic began there were a lot of options and a lot of places within USDA where remote work could be done, right? Richard Fordyce: But think about that local county office, where we have farmers coming in, working over a counter or sitting at a desk with one of our folks. When the pandemic happened, we had to pull all those folks, have them stay home for a period of time. And we didn't have the technology, and we didn't have really the ability for those folks to do that. In Washington, we pivoted very quickly to get them equipment, to get them technology and ways for farmers to participate remotely as well. And while I think there's about 16,000 employees, both in state offices, headquarters, and out in the country, we saw a transformation in a thought process and a willingness to make sure let's get this done. Richard Fordyce: I don't know that it has been recognized. So some of the credit goes to farmers because they had to adopt new technologies to be able to participate. But certainly that staff that had to literally pivot and do things a completely different way than they ever had in the past. So I don't know if I answered the question, Brooke, but I'll tell you, I've got the utmost respect for those folks that are carrying out that program. Brooke Appleton: No, that's good. And I think we're always kind of looking for ways too, that we can be more effective in working with FSA and kind of communicating what works and what doesn't work. Richard Fordyce: Yeah. And I think that happens. Brooke Appleton: Yeah. Richard Fordyce: A lot of times when we would first hear of an issue with the program, it came from the county office, and it came probably from a comment that a farmer or farmers in a certain part of the country would bring up as an issue within the local office. And I'm also very proud to say that our staff are not shy. If they see something that's not really being done in a way that they feel might be better, they're going to let us know as well. If I could just go one step further? Brooke Appleton: You have 30 seconds. Richard Fordyce: All right. So in administering a program within FSA, Congress says you're going to do it this way and you're going to do it this way in Maine, the same way in Minnesota, the same way in Texas, the same way in California. That can be a challenge. So we really relied on that local staff to tell us where the pain points were. Could we adjust, could we pivot, could we move something a little bit to make the number of folks that either were applying, or the benefit that the program was meant to give, was getting to the people that needed to get to in a way that made sense. And so again, that network of local county offices was critically important. Brooke Appleton: Yeah, that's absolutely correct. I think we definitely feel that, and we hear a lot about that important relationship. So switching gears again, just a little bit. Secretary Glickman in your career, it's spanned over a lot of different roles in public service, agriculture and food, and even the association in charge of rating movies. If you kind of think back to those challenges. A topic that's been very top of mind all over the country, industries who face and continue to wrestle with the challenges, particularly around diversity, equity and inclusion. What are some of the lessons from your time with USDA and Hollywood, if you will, that corn growers should take to heart in how we approach these conversations and issues? And just kind of a second part of that question, should the farm bill play a role in improving that access to the department's programs and resources? Daniel Glickman: Yeah. Well first of all, I have had an interesting life, and I haven't been able to keep a job for more than five or six years at a time, but that's okay. Brooke Appleton: I think it works for you. Daniel Glickman: And just going back Richard, to what you said, the smartest, most capable people I ever met in my political world were in two areas. One was the people who administered our farm programs, because they were honest and they were wanting to be accommodating and follow the law, but be as flexible as they could. And the other were people in the intelligence community, because I was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and the people who worked for the CIA and other agencies, they took a lot of flak, but they were also the same kind of people, professionals to the end. So my experience in government has actually been overall, pretty positive. And that doesn't mean that the people in our conservation world of the forestry service world or everybody else, weren't doing a great job. But that contact between the FSA person and the farmer was often the main contact that person had with the United States government on everything. Daniel Glickman: And that person could often be an ombudsman to help people with all sorts of other things. And so, one of the things I learned during my entire career, first of all, the best job in the world was being a Congressman, because you don't have a lot of authority, but you're free. You can do whatever you want. You can say whatever you want, but you still have to collaborate with 435 others in the house, and a hundred in the Senate, and everybody has their own ideas, and you got smart people like Heidi Heitkamp that are telling you all the time, \"That's a stupid idea, you need to do it another way,\" and you have to do the best you can. Daniel Glickman: And then when I got to the Department of Agriculture, you have a lot of power, but no freedom. Because Congress has invested us with all these abilities to deal with farm programs, and conservation programs, and water and sewer programs, and rural development, and forestry and food stamps, and school lunch, and just this broad area of authority. But as the President of the United States calls you up and says, \"Nah, can't do it this way.\" Or in my case, it was usually somebody calling up and says, \"I don't think the Arkansas corn growers would like what you're talking about.\" You may recall that President was from Arkansas. And so, are there any Arkansas corn growers here by any chance? Brooke Appleton: I don't think so. Daniel Glickman: Okay. Well, I used that as an example, it could have been cotton or rice growers or anything else. So I had a 100,000 people who worked for me, a 100,000 people who worked for me. But again, I had a lot of power over them, but I had to listen to Congress. And so it just is a whole different kind of a world. But what I learned in all my careers... and I had this strange change I went into, I was chief lobbyist for Hollywood. When I got the job, the guy who had the job before me was a guy named Jack Valente. And he had held that job for 35 years, he worked for President Johnson. And so, when he retired, I got the job. And I'm not exactly sure why I got the job. I said, \"What do I tell people about my qualifications?\" And he said, \"Well, tell them that when you were in the agriculture world, you used to grow popcorn, and now you sell popcorn in the movie world.\" That's why I wore these socks today. Brooke Appleton: We do have some popcorn farmers in the room though. Daniel Glickman: Is that right? Brooke Appleton: Yes. Daniel Glickman: Okay. All right. I'm a big popcorn advocate. But anyway, what I've learned from all the things I've done is you have to be flexible, you have to be fleet of foot, and you have to be honest. And people can see you through you in a New York minute, particularly farmers were very good at telling whether you were on the level or not. And so all those experiences together I think, made me a better public servant in whatever I did, whether it was in Congress or in the administration. That's about the best answer I can give you. Brooke Appleton: All right, good. Moving on. Senator Heitkamp, so crop insurance, as you know and you heard from many of us your time in the Senate, is the cornerstone of the farm safety net. And protecting that program will continue to be our number one priority as we make our way into the next farm bill. To your points that you've made as the nation kind of has become, and Congress has become more urban and maybe less focused on rural America. How important do you think the grassroots work that we do here will be... and educating efforts for new members and staff be, in passing the next farm bill? And do you have any good advice of impactful things that we could do to be more successful? Heidi Heitkamp: Yeah. I think if I were you all, the concern that I would have is that the conditioning of the crop insurance program. It's conditioned on you doing no till or minimum till, or it's conditional on you doing this. We need to start from a base of, do no harm. What we have right now is working. It is providing food security, not just for us, but for the rest of the world. And it absolutely is an essential safety net at a time of high input prices. And so, when I tell people the average farmer in North Dakota has almost a million dollars of input costs before they ever put a seed in the ground, people are shocked. And I say, don't tell us we're not risk takers. Tell me what other business would do that. And then pray that the weather didn't take you out, and that dollar values and commodity prices didn't take you out. And that your equipment would work, and you can find someone to fix your equipment when it doesn't work. Which is a whole different workforce issue and a huge challenge. Heidi Heitkamp: And so we've got to educate about the challenges of production agriculture and the risks you're already taking. And we have to start from that point of do no harm, in the crop insurance program. And it is absolutely essential that you spend time visiting with other people. And I know Dan didn't get a chance to answer the question about minority farmers, but I will tell you this, don't poke people in the eye. I mean, so there is a provision in the last go around in the stimulus package, or I guess the COVID package, that basically allowed for minority farmers to get some equity. The response was to sue the USDA. Is that the smartest response when you're trying to build collaborations, when you're trying to convince people in urban areas, when you're trying to convince people that we're all in this together? Heidi Heitkamp: And so I'm not... I mean, you make your judgment. And a lot of you are members of those organizations that actually initiated lawsuits. Is that the smartest use of your time? And you can say, \"Well, it doesn't seem fair to forgive their debt, we're not forgiving ours.\" There is tons of inequity I will tell you, in government spending. And if you want to build the relationships that you need to build to maintain the crop insurance program, to maintain title one, to maintain the forestry program, you're going to have to do the outreach and you're going to have to not take more water in your boat than you need to. If you want to fight waters of the United States, you have to build those relationships. You have to educate. And most of you know, I took the lead with Senator Inhofe to try and actually legislate what waters of the United States is. Heidi Heitkamp: You're going to be in this litigation forever. And so it's time to kind of step back and say, \"I may not agree with that as a matter of policy, but these are constituency groups that can be enormously valuable to build a broader coalition, as we look into the future.\" Think about this, if it's bad right now with consolidation and corporate ownership of farmland, it's going to be worse in five years. And what does the political ramifications of all that mean? It means that you're going to have to build broader relationships. It's just not enough to be somebody that Heidi Heitkamp's going to protect and defend in North Dakota. You've got to figure out how you're going to build that relationship with other, maybe more urban states. And so I would just say, crop insurance educate on how critical it is to food security, and national and international security, for American and like thinking democracies. And then, if they want to do modifications in other areas, have that discussion. Fight the fights you need to fight, don't take water on your boat you don't need to take on. Daniel Glickman: I have to add because she's a 100% right. And I'd make two things. I got to the Department of Agriculture on March 30th, 1995, and there were 400 minority farmers picketing in front of the Department of Agriculture. And I thought to myself, \"What is going on here?\" And it turned out that I became the defendant in a case called Pigford versus Glickman. Heidi Heitkamp: Yep. Daniel Glickman: Which was the largest civil rights case ever filed against the government up until that time. I didn't know anything about that case, because I also was one of those guys. I tended to talk to people on the Agriculture Committee most of the time, although I knew that various programs in the department affected urban America as well. Napoleon once said, \"War is too important to be left to the generals.\" And in the case of agriculture, agriculture is too important to our country just to be left to people in agriculture, because people eat, they come from all over the world, their global interest's involved as well. Daniel Glickman: And I learned from that battle with respect to civil rights, that a lot of people didn't understand what I was doing, what the programs were I was doing. And so my six years at USDA, that issue probably dominated my time more than any other issue that was there. But I learned... agriculture is so important, you just think about it. The environment is largely a rural and agriculture issue, we do it outside. 70% of the water in the world is used to irrigate crops and feed animals. The ability to deal with pest disease, plant disease, and drought, affects every human being on the face of the earth. Daniel Glickman: So we're interested in a lot of things, but in agriculture we're interested in more than what the reference price is. That's important to us, but to get the kind of reference price we want, we have to build those bridges with people. So, one suggestion I have is that as you folks lobby, just don't lobby the aggies. Just don't lobby the people in the Ag Appropriations Committee, expand your vistas. Brooke Appleton: Thank you for that. Daniel Glickman: It's easier to do in the Senate than it is in the House. I understand that. Brooke Appleton: And I will say part of our advocacy yesterday, we put together groups that do unaffiliated corn states, so we had 20 groups of four go around. So we hit over 150 offices that were kind of outside our traditional corn belt. And that's something we always try to do at this meeting here in the summer. So that's great advice, and we'll definitely continue to do that. Did you have something you want to add? Richard Fordyce: I do. Just for my seat in the ballpark, I think that that advocacy and that coalition building from an agricultural perspective, we've never had a better time than now, because we have an opportunity to tell really good stories about the things we're doing on our farms that are promoting climate smart agriculture. And I said, since climate smart agriculture kind of has become a thing, certainly a priority with the current administration, agriculture can truly be the folks on the white horse, right? I mean, the things that we've been doing, in some cases for decades, literally fall under that description of climate smart ag. And so, I think about this coalition building and advocacy as having a conversation on an airplane. So if I'm flying from here back to Kansas City, I can tell great stories that make agriculture look like a superstar, that whole flight. I think we're in a great time right now, where we can get that advocacy and that coalition building from a lot of different audiences because of the really good stories we have to tell. Brooke Appleton: Administrator Fordyce, while you were at USDA or we were at USDA I guess, we oversaw putting together the three most forward facing agencies within the department under FPAC. And could you talk just quickly about how that impacted the farm bill implementation, and some of the things that you saw from that perspective? Richard Fordyce: Yeah, I would. And I would love to hear Secretary Glickman's opinion on moving that [inaudible 00:34:05]. Brooke Appleton: It was very popular at first. Richard Fordyce: So anyway, Secretary Perdue had this vision of literally consolidating the three agencies that have historically the most direct touch with farmers. So RMA and FSA were in the same mission area. The secretary moved NRCS into our mission area and created a new one called FPAC, Farm Production and Conservation. So back to administering the farm bill. When we got the legislation, we met as three agencies twice a week, and we would go through and see where FSA and RMA maybe had a connection, or FSA and NRCS had a connection. And it worked exceptionally well to have those three agencies, that in a lot of cases are either housed in the same building in a county, but certainly have the same clientele, usually, almost exactly the same clientele. To be able to work together from an implementation standpoint. It worked very, very well. Richard Fordyce: So let's use CRP for an example, CRP is an FSA conservation program, but the technical assistance comes from NRCS. There had always been. And I think prior to the previous administration, those of you that had CRP contracts and were either trying to figure out how to get the contract finished through FSA, or get the technical assistance from NRCS, there was always a bit of a disconnect, because they were not reporting to the same folks. That changed almost overnight and it worked splendidly. And I think some of the changes that Secretary Perdue instituted, that probably was the most effective in my mind. Brooke Appleton: Well, we've got about five minutes left, so something I definitely wanted to hit on for the whole panel before we go today, but kind of looking ahead. And you mentioned carbon sequestration, that's something that we've heard so much about, but what topics do you think will play a larger role in the next farm bill? And Senator, we can start with you. Heidi Heitkamp: I think two things you should pay attention to. And one is, what initial incentives, not messing with what works already, but what initial incentives can be available to promote climate smart agriculture. And you think about it, 91% of the entire land mass of North Dakota is engaged in production agriculture. That means a huge opportunity to use that resource, continue to use the resource in production agriculture, but also another income stream. I always say, commoditizing carbon, how does that work? How can we create certainty? And we're not going to do it without educating people at the county office or our land grant colleges, to build workforce, because there's got to be certainty in this sequestration. And so, I recommend the work that Saxby and I did on the Bipartisan Policy Center. Daniel Glickman: It's great. Heidi Heitkamp: And Dan was on the committee with us, corn growers were represented. And so, the other thing that we haven't talked enough about is international trade. Heidi Heitkamp: We know we can produce, not just for this country, but for the world. What's going to be the restrictions on exports? What are we going to see in terms of implementation globally on climate smart technologies, that's going to limit your market? How can we build our technologies? And so what I would say is, as we're looking at, not just the climate side, but also the international trade side, what technological work needs to be done? What additional research needs to be done in this farm bill that can work? Heidi Heitkamp: And I want to raise another issue, because we had a great conversation offline. If I were in the Senate today, and I were looking at maybe not a farm bill issue, but long term challenges of American production agriculture, land ownership would be a huge concern. I raised this when I was already there, I think with Sonny Perdue, about what we were seeing in terms of family farmers, basically land going into trust. Farmers having to deal, not with grandpa and grandma whose kids didn't want to farm, and they understood it, but how were we going to deal with these fractionalized interests? Heidi Heitkamp: I did this when I was a tax commissioner in North Dakota, we were able to do some things with divided mineral interests. I think we need to look to those divided mineral interests to see how do we keep this land in production? How do we keep farmers making decisions about this land, without restricting private property rights? And I think that's a tough balance, but it's something we need to focus on and pay attention to. If we're going to maintain the tradition in America of family farming. Brooke Appleton: Secretary? Daniel Glickman: I would say a couple things. Number one is whatever we do on climate, climate smart agriculture, the private sector's getting much more involved in this, the entrepreneurial things that are happening in agriculture. We have to make it so the rules are clear for farmers, so they know what they're doing. The one thing that I hear about is, I hear all this stuff that's going on and I don't understand it, or what does it mean to me? Or how much does it cost? So the clarity in the conservation world is really going to be important. But I want to go back to this research question. Do we really want to let the Chinese and the Brazilians and everybody else get ahead of us? And I would have to say this, I think what you did in managing those farmer programs was actually pretty good. Richard Fordyce: Well, good. Daniel Glickman: Okay? Richard Fordyce: Good. Daniel Glickman: What I don't think was good is what Sonny did on the research side. When he basically moved part of the research functions to Kansas City, even though I'm from Kansas and you're from the Kansas City area. And I think it just had a terrible impact on morale for the people who work in that department. The idea was let's get these people out of Washington where the real people live, and they'll do better work there. Unfortunately, didn't work out. A lot of people left, the morale was not good. And so I don't think it helped the research establishment. Daniel Glickman: But going back to the main issue, what are our problems in the future? They're increasing productivity during a time when we have stress because of drought, half the west is burning up now. And water is going to be a continuing problem, particularly the competition for water. We've got to find ways to have more water resistant crops. And then of course we have to find ways to ensure that we continue to have talent in agriculture, which is always something that's really important. So I go back to this thing, 20 or 30 years from now, I don't want to see a zero research budget, because that's going to make your work almost impossible. Brooke Appleton: Yeah. Any last minute thoughts? Richard Fordyce: Yeah. So I think, and I don't know if it was the Senator or the Secretary that said, allowing crop insurance to be nimble. I think that in the past crop insurance regs were so rigid. Like we tried super hard to change plant dates with new seed technologies, we're planting earlier, we're planting later sometimes when we have to, and can expect to get a full crop. So the ability to be nimble from a double cropping perspective. And I would also say again, back to the climate smart agriculture piece, there are some provisions to allow for an offset in premium if you do cover crops. I think there may be an opportunity to have an offset in premium if you use a soil, biological, or something that is replacing some synthetic fertilizer, but expecting this similar yields. I think if we can have that nimbleness in crop insurance. Richard Fordyce: And then also to the secretary's point, I hope we don't get bogged down and super complicated. And this again, from an administrative perspective, super complicated climate smart programs. They need to be understandable, they need to be simple, they need to be adaptable and they need to be flexible. Again, the United States is a big country, there's a lot of diversity from a climate perspective, the growing seasons vary, but allowing for there to be flexibility. But I think it's crop insurance. And I think it's those provisions around climate smart agriculture that, I think, will kind of take the lead at least in the early discussions. Brooke Appleton: Great. Well, thank you all so much for being here today. It's been so productive and informative for our folks here for this week's farm Congress. So thanks so much again, and please give them a round of applause. Daniel Glickman: All right. Thank you.

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) disputed a lawsuit filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit against the U.S. EPA over recently finalized volume requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard. The lawsuit, filed by the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), made erroneous assertions about the impacts and benefits of farming. “Claims like these show that CBD’s leadership hasn’t visited a modern corn farm,” said Iowa farmer and NCGA President Chris Edgington. “I invite them to visit my farm so they can learn about the sustainable practices we employ daily. The corn we produce is not only helping feed the world during a very difficult time, but it is also used for clean and affordable biofuels that lower costs for consumers while cutting both carbon and toxic tailpipe emissions.” Edgington noted that corn growers are leading when it comes to increased yields that produce more corn with less land and fewer resources, meeting market demand for multiple uses of corn. He also noted farmers have continued to expand climate-smart agriculture practices, such as precision technology to reduce inputs, no-till and minimal tillage to store more carbon and save energy, and planting cover crops to improve soil health.",

    "title": "Federal Crop Insurance a Top Priority to Farmers, NCGA Grower Leader Tells Congress",
    "content": "Federal crop insurance is essential to farming and should be protected from harmful budget cuts and reforms in the 2023 farm bill, a National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) leader told House Agriculture Committee members today. “Federal crop insurance is a major pillar of risk management for the vast majority of corn growers,” Minnesota farmer and NCGA First Vice President Tom Haag told the Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management. “Simply put, the public-private partnership of crop insurance works and plays a significant role for agriculture in the wake of natural disasters.” Haag’s testimony comes as Congress continues to review implementation of the 2018 farm bill ahead of debate and reauthorization of the farm bill next year. During development, passage, and implementation of the 2018 farm bill, NCGA’s top priority was to maintain support for a robust crop insurance program. Both the House and Senate Agriculture Committees were able to defeat attacks on the program and found ways to strengthen federal crop insurance. Last week, corn growers from across the country were in Washington, DC, as part of NCGA’s Corn Congress summer fly-in. Throughout the week, corn growers stressed to their members of Congress the important role that the farm bill plays in their lives and rural America. Haag noted that NCGA and its state affiliates would provide farm bill recommendations over the coming months.",

    "title": "Meet Claire Menard, NCGA Research Ambassador",
    "content": "University of Minnesota-Twin Cities doctoral student Claire Menard has been researching genetic elements that contribute to corn’s phenotype. Claire was a part of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) Research Ambassador program. Coming from a non-agriculture background, she is grateful the program gave her the opportunity to connect with corn farmers to bring value to the purpose of her research. With a focus on how maize responds to environmental factors, Claire’s research works to understand how transposable elements (TEs) affect corn production. TEs have the ability to move within genomes of maize which ultimately affects agronomic traits. “My project is designed to identify these new regions where TEs jump into, measure the rate of movement, and characterize the types of TEs found within maize populations,” shares Claire, acknowledging TEs’ position in creating more sustainable practices. “TEs are greatly influenced by stress and may become activated under harsh conditions and thus contribute to changes in a trait.” Claire recognizes how the implications of TEs are often overlooked. However, her research has proven that TEs are not only responsible for genomic variation but also have a direct impact on phenotypic qualities. In addition, TEs are responsible for corn's response to stressful environmental conditions. “My research deals a lot with finding genes that will help produce more environmentally stable crops, and I think seeing the key areas of water usage, fertilizer and weed control in play helps me keep focused on the areas that will improve corn going forward.” Prior to her doctoral studies, Claire earned her Bachelor of Science in Cellular/Molecular Biology from Appalachian State University and Master of Science in Bioinformatics from the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. During her undergraduate studies, Claire’s passion for inclusion of minority scientists encouraged her to start Equity in STEM—a program that helped bring awareness to underrepresented scientists. Claire has been able to continue to create inviting spaces for diverse students through her graduate studies. The NCGA Research Ambassador program was developed by the Sustainable Ag Research Action Team and supported by Valent. The program is designed to create a network of young leaders passionate about the agriculture industry. Participants are given the opportunity to interact with corn growers, participate in Capitol Hill visits, attend NCGA meetings and connect their lab to the farm.",

I am so glad they listened.” The decision comes after CF Industries filed a petition with ITC in late 2021, requesting that the commission place tariffs on urea ammonium nitrate, which is used in liquid fertilizers. Shortages and prices have since increased exponentially. NCGA has come out strongly against the tariffs. It was the only commodities group that testified at ITC’s public hearing, and it forcefully raised the issue in the press. NCGA also engaged in an aggressive advocacy campaign with elected officials.

    "title": "Corn Growers, Working to Feed and Fuel the World, Call on Biden Administration for Help with Skyrocketing Input costs, Burdensome Regulations",
    "content": "As farmers work to feed and fuel the world, filling the void left by the war in Ukraine, national corn grower leaders unanimously passed a sense of the Corn Congress today calling on President Biden to maintain grower access to crop inputs. The vote came during the National Corn Growers Association Corn Congress meeting, which is being held this week in the nation’s capital. The measure, which is included in its entirety below, notes that “the world is facing skyrocketing fuel prices and potentially devastating food shortages, both of which can be addressed in part by America’s corn farmers, and America’s corn farmers have demonstrated a commitment to environmental sustainability through decades of documented reductions in soil erosion, greenhouse gas emissions and energy use.” It then asserts that “the ability to address the crises facing our world today in a sustainable manner cannot be achieved without fair access to the inputs necessary to raise a crop each year, including pesticides, fertilizer and biotechnology seeds.” The vote comes after EPA revised its atrazine registration, a move that could restrict access to a critical crop protection tool that has been well tested and shown to be safe for use. It also comes after the U.S. Supreme Court recently refused to hear a case decided by a lower court from California, leaving in place a ruling that supports the claim that glyphosate use causes cancer – even as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has repeatedly affirmed that the widely sold and well-studied herbicide is not carcinogenic. Farmers have raised the alarm that a patchwork of regulations related to the farming tool could pop up across the country. Farmers have also experienced major fertilizer price hikes and shortages over the last year thanks in part to steps taken by the U.S. International Trade Commission to impose tariffs on these products. Corn Growers also raised these issues with Congress during recent Capitol Hill visits. Sense of the Corn Congress Whereas, the world is facing skyrocketing fuel prices and potentially devastating food shortages, both of which can be addressed in part by America’s corn farmers, and; Whereas, America’s corn farmers have demonstrated a commitment to environmental sustainability through decades of documented reductions in soil erosion, greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, and; Whereas, the ability to address the crises facing our world today in a sustainable manner cannot be achieved without fair access to the inputs necessary to raise a crop each year, including pesticides, fertilizer and biotechnology seeds, and; Therefore, we, the assembled voting delegates of the National Corn Growers Association ask President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., to direct his administration to support American farmers by enforcing its granted federal authority to govern pesticide use through science-based policies and procedures, and eliminating unnecessary tariffs placed on fertilizers required to raise food and fuel for a world in need.",

I am a strong advocate for year-round E-15, which creates another source of revenue for Iowa corn farmers. I appreciate the work the National Corn Growers Association does to represent corn growers across the U.S., and I look forward to continue working together to support Iowa farmers.” Grassley serves on several committees, including the Senate Agricultural Committee.

    "content": "Alden Perkins is a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where his research is focused on improving seed lines by incorporating diversity from exotic corn varieties. During his time in the NCGA Research Ambassador program, Perkins has been able to better understand farmers' concerns which have helped him create purposeful research. “The conversations I had through this program gave me a better understanding of what growers look for when choosing hybrids and the relative value of different traits,” Perkins shared. “For example, it was very helpful to hear from growers based in other parts of the country about their experiences with managing tar spot and recent wind events.” Through his initial research, Perkins found that many of the current seed corn hybrids in the U.S. are the result of selecting the best progeny from improved U.S. inbred lines. While this has proven successful, W.A. Russell, Iowa State professor and colleague’s study on a Peruvian inbred line encouraged Perkins to explore exotic varieties. “My research takes advantage of quantitative genetic techniques, predictive modeling, and multi-location field trials conducted by the Genomes to Fields initiative to understand how breeders can use the tremendous genetic diversity found in corn globally to improve the crop here in the Midwest,” notes Perkins. With his research, Perkins hopes to better understand how the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize program can improve plant performance using exotic seed lines. Additionally, Perkin’s goal is to better understand germplasm enhancement to create elite inbred lines for growers. Before starting his research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Perkins earned his Master of Science at The Pennsylvania State University and his Bachelor of Science at the University of New Hampshire. At each respective school, Perkins served as a teaching assistant on science-based courses and labs. These experiences instilled a passion for getting students interested in agriculture and, more specifically, corn production.

    "content": "On June 27 and 28, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) welcomed growers and staff to this year’s Women and Mentors Retreat. Focused on building a network of rising leaders, women and mentors came together to overcome workplace obstacles, share their leadership journey and empower each other. The second annual conference kicked off with a lesson on Quieting Your Inner Critic and roundtable discussions. Both activities encouraged participants to put aside negative thoughts and experiences to lead with power and purpose. Then growers and staff separated into breakout rooms to individualize their experiences. Grower participants cultivated tools to lean on their network and get more involved in leadership, while staff learned tools to help them thrive in a male-dominated industry. This year’s conference concluded with a lunch program focused on Why Diversity is Important at Every Table. Attendees left encouraged to continue their networking experience in their newly formed cohort groups. These mentorship networks, formed during the conference, were designed to bring together women and male allies with shared experiences. \"The women and male allies who choose to get involved with this program are incredibly talented in a number of ways. The network this program created provides a space for women to ask questions and learn skills to move into leadership roles as they arise,\" shares Kendra Ricks, who organized this year’s conference. NCGA would also like to thank the sponsors that make this program possible: Syngenta, Bayer and John Deere.",

    "content": "CommonGround volunteers and state staff came together in St. Louis June 20 and 21 to inspire, empower and connect with each other. Just like other moms across the country, these women are passionate about their food, their children and each other. Through interactive sessions, inspiring panels and exciting activities, participants fostered their skills of advocating for agriculture. Highlights of this week’s event included a panel of inspiring women conducted by Tricia Beal, CEO of the Farm Journal Foundation. Panelists included six-time Olympic medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Balkan Treat Box owner Loryn Nalic, CommonGround Nebraska volunteer and J&S Feedlot Co-owner Joan Ruskamp and Dr. Ruth Kaggwa of the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. “Jackie Joyner-Kersee reminded us there is gold in everyone. I believe CommonGround has had that in mind from the beginning in our approach to connect our stories from the farm to urban moms,” said Ruskamp, reflecting on what her fellow panelist shared to the group. “We are called to see the gold in others beyond our CommonGround experiences, into our everyday lives bringing value and dignity to every person we meet.” Volunteers and state staff also had the opportunity to interact with students at the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Community Center—the foundation brings STEM learning opportunities to East St. Louis students. The idea for the collaborative reading event came following the success of the Kansas affiliation’s Growing Readers program. Older students ask questions to a small group of volunteer panelist while the younger students read ag-based books with CommonGround volunteers. This year’s conference was created to help inspire, empower, and connect participants. With a heavy focus on community involvement, CommonGround participants were able to connect with the young people of St. Louis while given the opportunity to network with other women in the agriculture industry. “What I took away is how much we need each other. As resources, for camaraderie and support that sometimes can be hard to find with other groups and friends. These women truly fill the gap in my life that sometimes no one else can. And I am forever grateful,” said Lauren Biegler, CommonGround Minnesota volunteer. CommonGround is a grassroot movement developed by the National Corn Growers Association and supported by state corn and soy affiliations. Volunteers come together to connect with mothers passionate about raising their kids and where their food comes from.

    "title": "Be an Informed Voter! Meet the FY23 Corn Board Candidates",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) will elect farmer leaders to fill positions on the NCGA Corn Board during Corn Congress on Thursday, July 14, in Washington, DC. The NCGA Corn Board represents the organization on all matters while directing both policy and supervising day-to-day operations. Board members serve the organization in a variety of ways. They represent the federation of state organizations, supervise the affairs and activities of NCGA in partnership with the chief executive officer and implement NCGA policy established by the Corn Congress. Members also act as spokespeople for the NCGA and enhance the organization’s public standing on all organizational and policy issues. Meet the Candidates Matt Frostic Frostic farms 1,000 acres of corn, soybeans, edible beans and sugar beets in east-central Michigan. On his farm, they also have approximately 550 head-finished beef cattle on feed. Matthew has gained hands-on experience in public policy, PAC work and organizational excellence through his service. Using these skills and his dedication to responsiveness and willingness to hear all viewpoints, he seeks to make collective and comprehensive decisions led by the majority but mindful of minority viewpoints. Matthew sees NCGA as not only the driver of all corn policy but a major influence on agriculture, energy, environmental and trade policy, with current and future success dictated by NCGA’s engagement in these areas. As a member of the Corn Board, he would prioritize work to develop new and sustain current policies to move the industry forward, fighting for the critical policy that supports ethanol use and grows markets, both foreign and domestic, for U.S. corn. Kelly Harsh Kelly Harsh farms more than 2,000 acres of corn and soybeans in central Ohio with her husband. A strong proponent of maximizing yield through soil health, she strives to enhance yield potential and efficiency on each acre through the use of a variety of precision processes. As a current member of the Corn Board, Harsh brings experience both as a grower leader and a financial professional to her service. She is a certified public accountant and a licensed crop insurance agent. A strong believer in the critical role associations like NCGA can play in an evolving national landscape; she represents the whole of membership in board discussions that draw upon expertise at all levels to create and implement policies and priorities critical to future success. Harsh’s first priority for NCGA is to represent the federation of states and strengthen its voice on the Hill. To do so, she would work to grow membership and corn demand. At the same time, she would advocate documenting, prioritizing, and publicizing sustainability improvements in corn production to increase future opportunities and build a strong foundation for continued success for the next generation. Mike Lefever Lefever raises exclusively no-till dryland corn on his farm southwest of Haxtun, Colorado. In addition to working his own land, he also helps his neighbor plant and harvest an additional 2400 acres of corn. While he farms in multiple places, he consistently adopts precision technologies that allow him to grow more using less. Lefever is running for reelection to continue the work he started during his first term. Eager to see through the work underway, he is neither embarrassed nor afraid to ask something when he doesn’t know. As a member of the Corn Board, he will continue working to build policies to protect the inputs corn farmers need to be profitable, which will lead to sustainability. Additionally, he would continue prioritizing the importance of both land and water infrastructure for transportation as well as decreasing tariffs abroad on U.S. corn. J.R. Roesner Roesner currently farms with his brother in six counties in southwest Indiana. Together, they raise corn, soybeans and wheat as well as operate an excavating and tile installation business. A unique voice with an unconventional educational background in mechanical engineering. As a leader, J.R. aims to actively listen in a way that facilitates communications and creative thinking. At the same time, he places a high priority on the board’s fiduciary responsibilities. A strategic planner, he provides direction, monitoring staff and programs to ensure the goals of the organization are met. In addition, he would be a strong voice with our industry partners. If elected, J.R. would prioritize protecting ethanol’s current markets while expanding new markets such as sustainable airline fuel. He also seeks to grow markets through the development of new uses, sustainability-related opportunities, and markets abroad while making sure that farmers have the freedom to operate and financial stability to build a future for their families. Jay Schutte Schutte, along with his brothers, farms the operation his parents started in central Missouri in 1952. Today, they farm 2,800 acres split evenly in a corn and soybean rotation. They also background approximately 800 head of beef cattle, with the inventory turning 2.5 times per year. A leader who deeply enjoys service, Jay is running for election to the Corn Board with a firm belief that he can contribute as a member with experience both on and off the farm in large and small businesses. This breadth of experience allows him to adapt to a variety of situations in a logical manner. A strong advocate for putting in the hours, doing the homework, and remaining on top of the ever-evolving array of issues facing agriculture, he actively engages in discussions that lead to decisions and move the needle. Jay sees NCGA as the organizing body that communicates with the states for the purpose of developing a single, unified voice for corn farmers across the United States. While there are many voices to be heard, he sees the unity of NCGA’s voice as the most important goal of the organization. As a member of the Corn Board, he will continue to work to build policies to protect the inputs of corn farmers. Brian Thalmann Thalmann farms 2,350 acres of corn and soybeans in south-central Minnesota. In addition to his traditional farming operation, he owns and operates a seed conditioning facility that cleans approximately 200,000 units of Stine soybeans every year. Brian believes that the Corn Board is most effective when every member brings a different and unique perspective to the table. Discussing the many facets of the issue at hand will lead to Corn Board decisions that are the best options for NCGA and the industry. Brian values the positive impact agriculture had on him personally, as well as the many ways in which corn-based products touch the lives of so many people every day. Working with his fellow farmers and staff, he will bring this passion and perspective to the Corn Board. If reelected, Brian will place a high priority on being fiscally sound and responsible in his actions while bringing NCGA to the forefront of new and expanded product opportunities. Brian also believes strongly in the importance of positioning the corn industry to take advantage of the political and consumer interest in going green as a foundation for many renewable, environmentally friendly biobased products. Dan Wesely Wesely farms both corn and soybeans, working with his neighbor in eastern Nebraska. As neighbors, they found themselves in the same places with the declining health of their fathers. Thus, they found ways to work together and independently using modern technology. Through his experiences on the Corn Board and prior, Dan brings the insight he gains into the needs of the American farmer to his work. This understanding drives him to run for reelection to the Corn Board, where he will continue working to positively impact the future of agriculture for all his fellow farmers. For Dan, this means being there for all corn producers, not only those from his home state, and keeping a calm, professional manner even in stressful situations. Notably, Dan was awarded the prestigious Member of the Year award in the past year. This honor recognizes the dedication, collaborative leadership and ability to achieve results. If reelected, Dan will work to protect existing and build new demand. He would accomplish this, and many other goals, by doing the hard work in a caring, positive manner.",

    "content": "NCGA has a new tool for growers: the Corn Rootworm Risk Tool. This calculator allows farmers to enter historical and current management data—along with corn rootworm intensity—to determine the potential risk of developing resistance to valuable Bt traits. By using the information submitted by the farmer or their technical advisor, the tool provides growers with a low-, medium-, or high-risk level and summarizes the appropriate best management practices for each scenario. This predictive tool is a helpful resource—not a replacement—for proactive conversations with technical advisors on what practices and strategies to employ. The ultimate objective of the calculator is to suppress corn rootworm populations using Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and to assist farmers in maintaining the effectiveness of important tools—like Bt corn—for generations to come.

    "content": "A Move that Could Restrict Access to a Critical Crop Protection Tool The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced today that it is revising its registration for atrazine, a well-studied herbicide essential to farming. “We are disappointed by EPA’s decision,” said Iowa farmer and National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) President Chris Edgington. “We can feed and fuel the world and fight climate change, but we can’t do these things without modern farming tools, and atrazine is a tool that is critical to our work.” The new labeling requirements will impose arduous new restrictions and mitigation measures on the herbicide, limiting how much of the product farmers use. The latest development marks a step backward in EPA’s commitment to transparency and the use of the best available science, Edgington said. However, he noted that EPA listened to growers’ requests and agreed to additional scientific review. Edgington said NCGA is committed to working with EPA in that process. The proposal will now enter a 60-day public comment period.",

    "title": "As NCGA Raises Alarms about Tariffs, Court of International Trade Begins Asking Tough Questions of Fertilizer Companies",
    "content": "Fertilizer companies have been under scrutiny this week as the Court of International Trade considers an appeal of the U.S. International Trade Commission’s decision to place duties on phosphorus fertilizers from Morocco and Russia. These developments come after the National Corn Growers Association has worked for months to eliminate tariffs on nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizer imports. “We have been banging on the doors in Washington, sounding the alarm and telling federal officials that tariffs are hurting farmers,” said NCGA President Chris Edgington. “This week, we saw some results as a judge with the Court of International Trade began asking tough questions about the assertions made by fertilizer companies.” The appeal came after the U.S. Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission last year ruled in favor of a petition by the U.S.-based Mosaic to impose duties on phosphorous fertilizers imported from Morocco and Russia. Mosaic had claimed that unfairly subsidized foreign companies were flooding the U.S. market with fertilizers and selling the products at extremely low prices. On Tuesday, Judge Stephen Vaden, with the Court of International Trade, grilled ITC officials about how they determined that unfair imports of phosphate fertilizer from Morocco had injured U.S. producers. Last year, CF Industries, another U.S.-based fertilizer company, also filed a petition with U.S. ITC asking that the commission place tariffs on certain nitrogen fertilizers imported from Russia and Trinidad and Tobago. NCGA quickly responded with an unusually direct op-ed, taking the fertilizer companies to task and arguing that tariffs placed a severe and unnecessary burden on family farms. Earlier this month, NCGA testified at a U.S. ITC hearing, where organization representatives made a strong case that shortages in nitrogen fertilizers are placing an undue burden on farmers and could eventually be detrimental to the global food supply. NCGA has also called on the Biden administration and Congress to step in on the matter if fertilizer companies don’t move to withdraw their ITC petitions. Both decisions by ITC and the Court of International Trade are expected later this summer.",

    "content": "Last week, Field to Market (FTM) held its June Plenary and General Assembly meeting in Raleigh, North Carolina. In addition to being the first in-person plenary held since June 2019, this was the first meeting led by Field to Market’s new president, Scott Herndon, who was appointed in January of this year. The meeting kicked off with thought-provoking considerations surrounding expanding and exploring research areas. That theme continued throughout the course of the meeting as members discussed possible R & D opportunities to better understand the roles supply chain actors play in supporting the adoption and retention of practices that support sustainable outcomes from U.S. commodity crop production used for our food, feed, fiber and fuel. Wednesday afternoon’s agenda included a panel presentation focused on the GHG Protocol Land Sector and Removals Guidance draft that will be released in late July. The guidance will explain how companies should account for emissions and removals from land use, land-use change, biogenic products, technological CO2 removals and related activities in GHG inventories, building on the Corporate Standard and Scope 3 Standard. The plenary meeting concluded on Thursday with a look at the potential benefits of third-party GHG tracking and verification; next, post-lunch collaboration continued with a cross-sector dialogue, “What Lies Beyond: Landscape Approaches to Sustainability.” The small group breakouts brought stakeholders together to learn more about community-based approaches to sustainable agriculture—from farmer-led watershed initiatives to regional supply chain collaborations. “This week’s meetings reinstated the importance of collaboration to achieve success in driving sustainable improvement,” said Nebraska grower and Field to Market Chair Brandon Hunnicutt. “It is really important for us to find tangible ways to measure our successes in conservation and stewardship.” Field to Market members can expect plenary recap documents to be shared in July.",

    "title": "Help Foster the Next Generation of Agriculturalists!",
    "content": "Nourish the Future—a national education initiative developed by science teachers for science teachers—has put out the call for the next round of Teacher Leaders! This national leadership program is a year-long cohort experience especially designed for middle and high school teachers. The Teacher Leader Community (TLC) program is limited to 20 teachers, and the deadline for TLC IV application is December 1, 2022. The leadership experience begins in January 2023 with a virtual celebration and introduction to the Nourish the Future (NTF) program. NCGA believes agriculture is a vital partner in engaging students in STEM concepts in ways that directly and indirectly impact their lives. Not only does teaching ag-based curriculum in the science classroom inspire students to solve real-world science issues, but reaching students is critical to address the job gap in agriculture-related careers, many of which go unfilled. But don’t just take our word for it! Two East Coast educators from the TLC III class recently shared their insights on how Nourish the Future’s curricula are impacting student perspectives on agriculture, sustainability and innovation. “Water and soil are natural resources that we cannot take for granted. Students need to become more aware of the water crisis that not only affects local communities but is a global problem. The food that they eat depends on healthy soil,” said Dinean Batchelder, a science teacher at Toms River Intermediate School South in New Jersey. “Through education and exposure to these topics, students can begin to collaborate and creatively hone their problem-solving skills to develop solutions and plans for improving water and soil quality. Educating our students is the first step to developing future global citizens who can change the world.” Jerry Citron teaches biology, AP environmental science and anatomy and physiology at Stuyvesant High School in New York. “My NYC public school students are very unaware of agriculture; they don’t think about where food comes from,” said Citron. “The lessons that I can incorporate, after talking to farmers and people in the industry and learning about the science, will be an interesting hook to get my students involved in these careers, in the aspects of agriculture that they really necessarily know.” Nourish the Future is made possible through the assistance of the National Corn Growers Association, the nation’s corn farmers, and their state corn checkoff programs.

While an important step in the process, the ruling will not on its own lead to the placement of duties on nitrogen fertilizers shipped into the country. The final stage in the process is expected later this summer when the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) makes a final ruling on the matter. “Placing tariffs on nitrogen fertilizers will land yet another blow to farmers, who are already dealing with a host of issues,” said Brooke S. Appleton, vice president of public policy at the National Corn Growers Association. “Farming is hard enough in the current environment. Farmers can’t do what they do with one hand tied behind their backs. And actions like these, pushed by fertilizer companies, will tie the hands of farmers.” NCGA spoke during the recent hearing held by ITC, telling commissioners that tariffs on nitrogen fertilizers will place an undue burden on farmers by creating additional fertilizer shortages and unwarranted price hikes.",

    "content": "Sixteen years ago, the U.S. Senate approved the designation of a “National Pollinator Week” to help bring to light the issue of declining pollinator populations. It has now grown into a worldwide celebration of all pollinators--bees, birds, butterflies, bats, beetles and small mammals, just to name a few! NCGA is proud to support pollinator health awareness through initiatives like the Bee and Butterfly Habitat Fund, the Honeybee Health Coalition, and Farmers for Monarchs. These programs offer online tools, educational resources, and best management practices to help support pollinator habitats. By incorporating pollinator forage and creating a pollinator-friendly landscape in tandem with their croplands, growers can protect soil health, improve water quality by controlling runoff and sediment, and capture carbon in the environment. Last October, NCGA also entered into partnership with Pheasants Forever (PF) and Quail Forever (QF) to increase pollinator and wildlife habitats in corn-producing states. The collaboration—funded by NCGA’s Production Technology Access Action Team—focuses on corn producers in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, with room for additional state expansion down the road. To date, PF and QF farm bill biologists have conducted 59 farm visits across Ohio, Illinois, and Iowa. With approximately 90 million acres of corn planted each year across a wide range of geographies, farmers have an important role in supporting pollinators and their habitats. Around 75% - 95% of all flowering plant species need pollinators for reproduction. In turn, pollinators provide their services to 180,000 different plant species and more than 1,200 crops. That translates to one out of every three bites of food being eaten are provided by our pollinators! Pollinators contribute to ecosystem health and a sustainable food supply.

    "title": "EP. 35 - Ethanol Mythbusting: How Corn Ethanol Can Take the Edge Off Inflation for America, with Geoff Cooper",
    "content": "The CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association helps Jon knock down some common misconceptions about ethanol. The rising cost of food and fuel are everywhere right now. From big headlines in the news to your own wallet, Americans are feeling the pinch of rising prices. And in the corn industry, we're still leveraging a powerful tool to help take the edge off the financial pain we all feel each week: corn ethanol. In this episode, we’re talking to Geoff Cooper, CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, about how ethanol can help Americans weather this economic storm. And we’re busting some common ethanol myths that keep on turning up everywhere from policy discussions to social media. DIRECT SHARE LINK TRANSCRIPT Geoff Cooper: Consumers, the most obvious sign that they see of inflation is when they drive past a gas station and see that record pump price. We've got a good story to tell there. Ethanol reduces those gas prices. Dusty Weis: Hello and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host, Association CEO Jon Doggett. From the fields of the corn belt to the DC beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: You can't turn on the news these days without hearing about the rising costs of food and fuel, and in the corn industry we're leveraging an old tool to take the edge off that inflation, corn ethanol. In this episode we're talking to Geoff Cooper, CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, about how ethanol can help Americans weather this economic storm, and we're busting some common ethanol myths that keep on turning up everywhere from policy discussions to social media. But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app, also make sure you follow the NCGA on Twitter @NationalCorn, and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at NCGA.com. Dusty Weis: And with that it's time to once again introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association, and Jon, I won't lie, one of my favorite TV shows when I was a kid, and this hearkens all the way back to the day when there was actually science on the Discovery Channel still, it was a little program called the MythBusters, and I understand that that's what we've got on tap for today's episode, is a little myth-busting of our own. Jon Doggett: Absolutely. You know, Dusty, over the years we have heard so many arguments against ethanol, and we wanted to get together to debunk some of the most common arguments that we hear or see, and we've all seen or heard or read about all sorts of terrible things that ethanol does, I'm especially thinking about the contributions from those pesky keyboard warriors on social media, and some questionable scientists who have made some wild claims even as of late. So we figured who better to help me debunk some of these wild claims than Geoff Cooper, who is the President and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association. So Geoff, welcome, and thanks for joining us on the NCGA podcast. Geoff Cooper: Well thanks for having me, Jon, I was thinking I might not ever get an invitation, so glad to be here today. Jon Doggett: Sooner or later we get to everybody Geoff, but before we get too much further into busting ethanol myths, can you tell our listeners about your background? I mean, you're certainly no stranger to corn. Geoff Cooper: Sure, Jon, happy to, and thanks again for having me. And as I was thinking about my background it occurred to me that I'm celebrating 14 years at RFA, So I've been with the Renewable Fuels Association for 14 years now, the last three and a half years have been serving as the CEO, and prior to that, as you know, Jon, I worked for your great organization, the National Corn Growers Association, I was there for about five years, started out in communications there at NCGA, but our old friend Dr. Richard Glass pulled me over into the research and market development in of the corn growers organization and put me to work on a number of ethanol issues. And that was, of course, right in the middle of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and Energy, Independence, and Security Act of 2007, where we got the first RFS and the expanded program. Geoff Cooper: So Jon, I was working very closely with you and the rest of the DC staff at that time to make sure we were arming our allies and our champions with the facts, with the data, with the right information, to debunk the myths around ethanol that were rampant at that time. So that brings us full circle to this conversation, 15 years later, we're still debunking a lot of those same myths and a lot of that same misinformation that just continually gets regurgitated and recycled. Jon Doggett: So Geoff, let's just dive in, and let's start with one of the easy myths. You've heard it and I've heard it, ethanol ruins my boat engine. Geoff Cooper: Yeah, this one we hear a lot, and it happens to be one of those myths that's seasonal in nature. Every Memorial Day weekend we really start hearing from the boating community again, and summertimes here, so we've been hearing a lot about this one lately. And I think it really stems from the fact that some of these gas stations that are located near big lakes and places where people take their boats out, or at marinas, they've got one of the biggest rackets going that I've ever seen. They sell what they're now calling marine gas, or ethanol-free gasoline, and they scare boaters into buying this stuff for a dollar or more per gallon higher than what they would spend on E10. But the bottom line is E10 is approved for all inboard, all outboard Marine engines, certainly any engines that have been made in the last 20 to 25 years all carry the manufacturer's approval to use E10. Geoff Cooper: In fact you've got some of the manufacturers, big ones, like Mercury Marine, Brunswick, that actually recommend the use of E10, they say it's a superior fuel for many cases and many uses, and they also recognize that it's better for water quality and better for the environment. I think a lot of this stems from the notion that ethanol is hygroscopic, meaning it does entrain water, and that's a fact. It doesn't pull water out of the air per se, but if you get moisture in your fuel tank the ethanol molecules are going to bond with that water, but it's actually a benefit because if you get moisture in your fuel tank ethanol actually carries it out of the fuel system. So this is a myth that we continue to hear time and time again, and again, it seems like especially in the summertime when people are pulling their boats out, that's when we really hear it. Geoff Cooper: And along with that we hear, \"Well, you can't leave E10 in the tank of your boat because it's really going to cause problems.\" And that's true of any fuel, whether it's got ethanol in it or not, and in fact the department of energy a few years ago really compared E0 versus E10, and they found that the E0, the gasoline without ethanol, actually degraded faster and became unsuitable for use more quickly than the E10 did. So this is another one of those common myths that, again, I believe it's being perpetrated by folks who stand a benefit from selling that more expensive ethanol-free gasoline to boaters who don't know any better. Dusty Weis: See, and I want to know what lake you're boating on, Geoff, because up here in Wisconsin, finding marine fuel for just a dollar above the going rate, that's a bargain compared to what they're charging on the Madison chain of lakes, let me tell you. Geoff Cooper: Well, that's right, And even here at Lake of the Ozarks, not far from St. Louis, I know that marine fuel, again, which I think is a misnomer, but that fuel was selling for $2 a gallon more than E10 in that area as recently as Memorial Day. Dusty Weis: Yikes. Jon Doggett: Wow, boy, that makes it pretty tough to run a boat all day long when you're spending that kind of money. So Geoff, here's another one we've heard a lot about lately with the supply shortages, and the situation in Ukraine, the RFS increases food and gas prices. What do you say to that? Geoff Cooper: I say it's absolutely ridiculous. And again, I think all you have to do is go to your nearest gas station and you'll find ample evidence there that renewable fuels are lowering the price of gasoline today. Jon, as you know, ethanol in the last few days, the last few weeks, is selling for $1.50 a gallon less than gasoline at the wholesale terminals where gasoline is blended, $1.50 a gallon less. And so obviously when you blend more of that low cost product with gasoline it's going to result in a lower cost for the finished fuel. And we're certainly seeing that at retail stations across the country today, the lowest priced fuel available anywhere in the country today is going to be the fuel with the most ethanol in it, and right now that's E85, but even E15 blends, we're seeing those priced 30 cents, 40 cents per gallon, less than E10 and oftentimes 60 to 80 cents below the cost of E0, the gasoline without ethanol. Geoff Cooper: So to suggest that the RFS, and really the RFS is what helps drive ethanol production and consumption, to suggest that the RFS is somehow contributing to higher fuel costs, especially right now, is just insane. The same thing could be said on the food inflation side, this is another battle we've been fighting forever, but we all know, and the data and the evidence show quite clearly, that there's no relationship between the RFS and what consumers pay for food at the grocery store, and I'm sure we'll get more into that as we go through our conversation today. Jon Doggett: Another myth that we've heard a lot over the years, and that is the production of ethanol requires so much fossil fuel energy that its energy benefit is only about 20%. Geoff Cooper: Jon, you might recall that one of the first projects I worked on at NCGA was a big debate at the National Press Club that we sponsored on this very issue, the so-called ethanol energy balance, and this notion that it takes more energy to make ethanol than you get out of it. We wanted to settle that once and for all back in 2005 or 2006, and at that time somehow the media's view of the experts on this topic was a bug doctor from Cornell, David Pimentel, an entomologist, and a former Chevron engineer. So those two guys came to the Press Club and debated Bruce Dale, a professor from Michigan State, an engineer, and I thought he did a great job of dispelling the myth back then, but we're still talking about it all these years later. Geoff Cooper: It's not a hard one to dispel, all you got to do is track the energy use throughout the process to produce ethanol, it's pretty easy to do that, you sum up all of that energy use, and when you do that currently the energy balance, or the energy ratio, the return, is about three to one currently. And that means for every BTU, or every unit of energy that you invest in the process to make ethanol, you're getting three units worth of usable energy in the form of ethanol back out. Geoff Cooper: The other thing I'd just quickly point out on that one is the energy used in the process is really not that much crude oil or petroleum, it's not an oil dependent process. Yes, tractors and combines use diesel, trucks moving corn and ethanol around use diesel, but when you look at how much they're using on a per bushel produced basis, or a per gallon basis, it's tiny. And in fact, Argonne National Lab said for every barrel of petroleum used in the ethanol production process, you're getting 20 barrels of ethanol. Most of the energy that we use in the process, most of the fossil energy, is in the form of natural gas, whether that's embedded in the fertilizer at the farm level, or natural gas used at the ethanol facility. So we feel like that's a myth that should be dead and buried, we've killed it a number of times, but it does tend to pop its head up from time to time. Jon Doggett: There are days that I think that we need stakes and garlic to go ahead and get these things to finally die, but if we could, Geoff, you mentioned energy balance, what's the energy balance for gas, the basic component of gasoline? Geoff Cooper: I think you know the answer to that Jon, and that's probably why you're asking the question. The energy balance for gasoline has been shown to be negative in some cases, meaning that there's more energy invested in the process to extract and transport and refine crude oil and distribute it then you're getting out of it, or it's roughly neutral. But again, I go back to what Professor Dale said at that event years ago, and he said, \"Look, energy balance is probably the wrong metric to look at anyway, it's fairly useless. If we based all our decisions on the energy balance we would've never used coal, because it takes two or three BTUs worth of coal to generate one BTU of electricity.\" So we need to look at how we use these fuels and different energy sources, and it's easy to get hung up on BTUs, and in many cases that's the wrong argument. Geoff Cooper: It's like saying apples or tomatoes are terrible foods because they're low in protein and the body needs protein. You don't eat an apple or a tomato for protein, you eat it for fiber or potassium. And in that same way we don't use ethanol primarily for its BTUs, we use it for its octane value, we use it for its lower carbon content, we use it because it dilutes sulfur and gasoline. So we got to take a more holistic approach and just get beyond this ridiculous debate over BTUs and energy balance. Jon Doggett: Well, and somewhat tied to that is the other myth about the cost of gas made with ethanol is actually higher per gallon because ethanol reduces gasoline's energy per gallon. So if I'm using a high blend of ethanol in my car, am I going to lose a lot of my mileage advantage? Geoff Cooper: Yeah, and we're hearing a lot of that one today, Jon, aren't we? Because again, we're talking about E15 being 30, 40 cents a gallon cheaper than E10, we're talking about E85, seeing huge discounts for E85. But then you get the naysayers saying, well, because of that lower energy content, that lower BTU value, you're getting worse mileage, and so you might not be saving any money. There's really two issues there, and the first one is with low-level blends, like E15, you're really not losing any fuel economy or seeing much reduced mileage. Geoff Cooper: A study that's just been completed at the University of California Riverside took 20 vehicles and compared the emissions, primarily, but also looked at the fuel economy in those vehicles when they're using E10 and E15, and what they found is on average, across those 20 vehicles, when you're using E15 you got 1.3% lower mileage. That's less than you're going to notice if your tires aren't properly inflated. And in four of those vehicles we actually saw better mileage on E5 than we saw on E10, and why do you think that is? Because they had higher compression ratios, because they had direct injection and they're able to take advantage of that slightly higher octane value that you get with E15 than E10. And if we had high octane fuels like E25 or E30, and automakers were optimizing or tuning their engines to take full advantage of that octane, you'd see no difference in mileage per gallon, and you'd be getting the same mileage on fewer BTUs, and that's really the definition of energy efficiency. Jon Doggett: So the three of us are of an age where when we were growing up muscle cars were cool, but they're not cool anymore. The sweet sound of catback exhaust doesn't thrill motorists any longer, instead they prefer the anti-climactic whisper of nothingness that comes from electric motors. So talk about that, Geoff, electric vehicles, are they better for the environment because they don't use fossil fuels and they have no tailpipe emissions? Geoff Cooper: Well, no, they're not, and I for one love the sound of a muscle car firing up, and that four barrel car, and again, that high octane bump that you get from ethanol really provides additional horsepower for those sorts of vehicles. But on the environmental question, no. There's this misnomer out there that because electric vehicles don't have a tailpipe that they are zero emissions vehicles. That's the terminology that everybody uses, ZEVs or zero emissions vehicles. Well, what about upstream of the vehicle, and where is the electricity coming from that is charging that battery? Those are all very important implications, and that electric vehicle is not zero emissions unless it is using a source of electricity that generated zero emissions. Geoff Cooper: And in this country today we're still getting 60% of our electricity from fossil fuels, we're getting 20% from nuclear, and 20% or less from renewable forms like solar and wind, so when you factor that full supply chain in, where the electricity was generated, when you factor in the emissions related to extraction of the rare minerals that are in the battery, when you factor in the emissions related to disposing of that battery at the end of its life, electric vehicles, in many cases, again, depending on the source of the electricity, are no better than liquid fuels, and certainly no better than a high ethanol blend, or a flex fuel like E85 is going to perform better in terms of life cycle, carbon intensity, than an electric vehicle. Geoff Cooper: It just reminds me of a guy that works in the building where our office is, drives a Tesla. And one day I was curious and just asked him, \"Why did you buy that thing? What was it that convinced you to buy the Tesla instead of another internal combustion engine vehicle?\" And for him it was all about, \"Well, the environment. I want to reduce my carbon footprint and reduce my emissions.\" And you should have seen his face when I told him, \"Sir, the electricity that you are charging that vehicle with when you plug in every night is coal fired. The Missouri grid is largely served by coal fired power plants, and so you're not doing the environment any favors, and you're certainly not reducing your carbon footprint by driving a Tesla. So those are the sorts of things that we just need to do a better job of educating the public about. Jon Doggett: And one of the things that we do in our organization a lot, and I know that you worked on it when you worked for us, and that is corn production's bad and it increases greenhouse gas emissions, and that means ethanol has high greenhouse gas emissions, and it isn't good for the environment at all. Compare that to the electric cars not having quite the carbon footprint that people would think, what about corn production? Geoff Cooper: I think it's just the opposite with corn ethanol. A lot of people have bought into the myth that corn ethanol is somehow not climate friendly and doesn't reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but again, it's fairly easy to track the energy use and the emissions related to every step in the process to produce corn ethanol. You can look at how much natural gas is used to make the fertilizer that is applied to the fields, and you can look at how much of that volatizes and becomes nitrous oxide, and you can look at how much natural gas is used at the ethanol facility, how much diesel fuel is used in either the locomotives or the trucks that are moving all this stuff around. Take all of that, add it all together, look at the emissions associated with it, and you will find that corn ethanol today is about 50% lower in terms of its life cycle carbon intensity than gasoline. Geoff Cooper: And again, that compares very favorably to electric vehicles, depending on what source of electricity is charging the battery. And we actually see a pathway to get to fully carbon-neutral corn ethanol through carbon capture and sequestration through the things that your members are doing at the farm, and so we could have a fully carbon-neutral corn based ethanol fuel, we think, in the next few decades, even when you consider all the energy involved in the process, there will be enough carbon sequestration to offset those emissions and give us a carbon-neutral or net zero-carbon liquid fuel. Jon Doggett: Before we started rolling tape here this afternoon I was mentioning that I had been talking to one of my neighbors yesterday, and he was absolutely amazed that you can get more out of corn in the ethanol process other than just ethanol, and he didn't realize that, I think a lot of people think that, that corn goes into the ethanol plant and ethanol comes out the backside and that's it. What are the other products that are being extracted in this process? Geoff Cooper: That is something that is often overlooked, Jon, and again, we've been talking about it since the beginning of the ethanol industry, but when you take a 56-pound bushel of corn and run it in the front gate of an ethanol plant, you're getting multiple products out the backside of that process. And yes, you're getting nearly three gallons of ethanol, but you're also getting about 15 or 16 pounds of high protein, very nutritious animal feed that's called distillers grains, we produce in this industry 35, 40 million tons of that animal feed every year, about a third of that is exported to countries around the world. It's a very popular, very economical feed source for beef, dairy, swine, poultry, fish. It's become just an integral component of the global feed supply. So that's one of the main co-products that comes out of the ethanol process, but we're also getting distillers corn oil. The fat, or the oil, that's in that corn kernel can be separated out and used as a feedstock for other biofuels, like renewable diesel or biodiesel, or in itself is a valuable feed ingredient, especially for certain species, like poultry. Geoff Cooper: So those are the main co-products, but we're seeing other things coming out of some of these ethanol plants that is just really fascinating stuff. They've learned how to extract the optimal value out of that corn kernel that comes in the front end of the process, there's some fiber separation things going on, there's all sorts of interesting things happening with that process, and we tell people, look, these aren't really ethanol plants, per se, these are biorefineries. Ethanol just happens to be one of the products that they're producing, but it goes far beyond that. Jon Doggett: The beginning of the pandemic, when much of the ethanol industry was either shut down or at least cutting way back, I got a call from a good friend of mine in the livestock industry, and you probably know who I'm talking about, called me up and he said, \"I want to talk to you about ethanol.\" \"Oh boy, I don't want to talk to you about ethanol one more time,\" and he said, \"No, you need to get these plants going,\" and I said, \"What?\" He said, \"You need to get these plants going because we need that carbon dioxide to stun and chill hogs.\" That was an interesting phone call to get, one I hadn't anticipated.\" Geoff Cooper: Well, and I'm glad you brought that up, Jon, because that is another co-product that we often fail to mention. As a byproduct of fermentation we also get 15 or 16 pounds of carbon dioxide from every bushel that runs through the process, and we've got about quarter or a third of the industry today that is capturing that CO2 rather than venting it to the atmosphere, because there are very valuable uses for carbon dioxide, you mentioned one of them, but it's also used to make dry ice, it's used in refrigeration, it's used in medical procedures, it's used in welding, waste water treatment, I could go on and on, bottling, I mean, the bubbles in your beer or your Pepsi, that's CO2 and it probably came from an ethanol plant. So you're right, when the pandemic hit and we shut 50% of the industry down, we were getting calls from all of those users of CO2 saying, \"What's going on? We need to get these plants back online.\" Jon Doggett: Good things to remember, good things to remember. So Geoff Cooper from the Renewable Fuels Association, tell me, how much did the American taxpayers support ethanol through the subsidies? Geoff Cooper: Good one, Jon. The ethanol industry is not subsidized today, and again, that's a myth that just will not die. We hear it every day, I can't tell you how many times, and you mentioned social media earlier today, we see comments on Twitter or Facebook that well, nobody would be using ethanol if not for the subsidy. And it's like, what subsidy are you talking about? There was, as you know, Jon, for many years, a blender's tax credit that did allow gasoline blenders who used ethanol to take an excise tax credit and claim that on their annual taxes. And it was a strong incentive to get those blenders to increase their use of ethanol and blend it into the fuel supply when they otherwise probably would not have done so. Geoff Cooper: That tax credit expired more than 10 years ago, it expired at the end of 2011, it expired because the ethanol industry and our friends in the corn world agreed that that program had served its purpose, and it had done what it was intended to do. And that's what subsidies are for, is to help infant industries get on their feet. That program did that with the ethanol industry, it was no longer needed, and so we let that program expire. Yet today we continue to hear this notion that well, the ethanol subsidy is the only thing that makes ethanol economical. That's nonsense. We've also heard the Renewable Fuel Standard described as a subsidy for ethanol, and that again is nonsense. The RFS, the reason it exists at all, is to help our industry, to help renewable fuels, which are lower carbon, lower priced, access a market that otherwise would be closed to competition. That's what the RFS does, that's not a subsidy, it's just a wedge that helps us get into a market that otherwise would be closed to us because it's essentially a monopoly. Jon Doggett: So over the years, what is your favorite myth to debunk? The one that when you hear it you smile because you know that you've got the Geoff Cooper answer to it. Geoff Cooper: Well, I'd like to think that we do pretty good responding to all those, but Jon, the food versus fuel argument is a really easy one to debunk if you can get just two minutes of someone's attention, and it gives us a chance to tell a good story, and I like to do that, I like to hopefully educate people and tell them something they don't know about the ethanol industry. It gives us a chance to talk about those co-products, it gives us a chance to talk about the tremendous gains in efficiency that we've seen throughout the process, whether we're talking about corn yields, whether we're talking about more efficient nutrient use on the farm, whether we're talking about what's happening at the biorefinery, it really gives us a chance to explain to people that, hey, this is a high tech, highly efficient industry and process, and there is no competition between food and fuel. The industry has risen to the occasion, and we're able to meet demands for all uses. Dusty Weis: You know, Geoff, I think that ethanol, and certainly the corn industry, have a really great story to tell here. It's not necessarily a story that certain segments of the public has always been receptive to, but sometimes when you're in the business of telling stories you find a moment and that is a great moment to tell a particular story. And when you look at the news headlines that you see right now, record-high inflation yet again, and people struggling to pay at the pump, or at the grocery store, and all that, is this a great moment to get out there and redouble our efforts to tell ethanol stories. Geoff Cooper: This is one of the best moments, one of the best opportunities, I think, that has presented itself to our industry in recent memory, and that's because of a combination of factors. Like you said, we got consumers, the most obvious sign that they see of inflation is when they drive past a gas station and see that record pump price. We've got a good story to tell there, ethanol reduces those gas prices. Then they go to the grocery store and they see that their grocery bill has gone up. We're able to tell a good story there that, hey, ethanol is food and fuel. We're producing that more efficient, lower-cost animal feed, and then the climate benefits are also very much front of mind right now. We got a lot of people concerned about climate change and increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and we've got a phenomenal story to tell there. Geoff Cooper: At the same time we've got the situation in Ukraine, and that's what's really driving the record-high pump prices that we're seeing today. And I think people forget about the energy security benefits of producing domestic renewable fuels, and the fact that we're adding 15 billion gallons of volume to the US fuel supply, and that's helping keep prices down and making us less dependent on imports from Russia and other places like that. So this is a moment in time, I think, where we've got a great opportunity to tell the industry's good story and really open some eyes to the benefits of renewable fuels. Dusty Weis: Now because if you think that $5.30 cents a gallon is bad, you should see what they're paying in Europe right now. Geoff Cooper: Yeah, that's right, and just think about what prices would be if we didn't have 10% of every gallon, that demand being satisfied with domestically produced ethanol, which is $1.50 a gallon lower than gasoline right now. If we didn't have that 15 billion gallons being added to the supply, we wouldn't be talking about $5 gasoline, we'd be talking about $7 gasoline. So again, this gives us an opportunity to do some education and bust some of these myths and misunderstandings that people have about what we do. Dusty Weis: You know, Geoff, for some reason, I can't help myself, but I will occasionally crack open my Twitter app, or my Facebook, and I'll page through and I'll see the latest zaniest thing that comes across my feed. But I have to ask you, as someone who's in the business of batting down myths around ethanol, what's the most egregious, weirdest, over the top ridiculous claim that you've ever heard against ethanol? Geoff Cooper: We've heard a lot of them. I'm not even sure I could tell you what the most egregious is, I'd have to go back and look at my file, which is that thick. But I'll tell you one of the latest ones that has just made me laugh because it's so ridiculous, there's something going around on TikTok, and I know nothing about TikTok, but my staff says, \"You got to see this,\" and there's something going around saying that gasoline has lost its smell. Gasoline has lost that pleasant, aromatic aroma that it used to have, and it's because of ethanol. That's what's going around right now. Geoff Cooper: It's like, boy, I certainly don't remember ever thinking that the smell of gasoline was like lilacs, or anything like that. And I told one of our staffers, the solution there is we need to invent a gasoline scented candle that would satisfy their appetite for that sweet smell. I mean, that's the kind of crazy stuff that we see. We've seen ethanol blamed for riots in Mexico over high tortilla prices, we've seen ethanol blamed for reduced population of pheasants, we've seen it all, so really nothing surprises me anymore. Dusty Weis: You know, Geoff, in the business there's a term, they call it the summer driving season, and really what that means is the weather isn't crap and we're all getting out and making the most of life for a little bit, at least here in the Midwest. And so I've heard, a little bird has told me, that you consider yourself to be quite the music nerd, I know that Mr. Doggett and I are music buffs ourself, so got to ask you, what is on the summer driving season plans for getting out and seeing some live music? Geoff Cooper: Well, yeah, that's a great question. I need to look more closely at what's coming through town this summer, it seems like there have been some concerts added recently, and some that have been removed. I do know for a fact that I will be seeing Jason Bonham, the son of Led Zeppelin drummer, John Bonham, he's got a band together and they're doing a bunch of Led Zeppelin music. I know that we've got tickets for that show. We've also got Dead & Company coming up later this summer, some of the remaining members of the Grateful Dead, if you can believe those guys are still around. So I know I got those two for sure, but we'll certainly be adding more as the summer goes on. Dusty Weis: What about you, Jon? Jon Doggett: If I could find a way to get to see the Stones it would be just wonderful, and better see them pretty soon because sooner or later. But they take good care of themselves and live a lifestyle that is clean and above board, so they might go another 60 years, but to think that they've been going 60 years now, and that's truly amazing. So I would like to see the Stones. I saw the Trucks Tedeschi Band a couple months ago, and I'd love to see them again. Geoff Cooper: Jon, they're coming through St. Louis, and I'm glad you mentioned that, I'll be checking that out for sure, they're great. Jon Doggett: Great concert, I was there couple months ago and would absolutely go again. Also looking forward to, I think that Joe Bonamassa will be back through the DC area maybe early next year, and for those that don't know who Joe Bonamassa is, he is the greatest white blues guitarist that no one has ever heard of. And so I'm thinking on that, and if Beth Hart is with him for that concert, and man, she can sing, she's a blues singer from the get go. So yeah, there's a lot of great music out there, and I am looking forward to having a summer where we can actually get out and listen to some music under the stars at Jiffy Lube, or at Wolf Trap, there's just a lot of great venues and a lot of great music out there. Dusty Weis: It is great to have live music back, and Geoff, I know you mentioned your Led Zeppelin connection that you're getting to see, I've got a little, I guess six degrees of Led Zeppelin connection. But Led Zeppelin had a bass player, I believe, John Paul Jones, and he also played in an act called Them Crooked Vultures with a super group, with Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters and Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age. I saw Queens of the Stone Age open for Rage Against the Machine 15 years ago, we called it the Battle of Alpine Valley up here in southeast Wisconsin, it just so happens that Rage Against the Machine will be playing at Alpine Valley once again, a show that was delayed two years due to COVID. First time they've toured together in a real long time, and I'm excited about it. Geoff Cooper: And it's all four of the original members? Tom Morello. Dusty Weis: And all four of them. It seems like they can stand being around each other about once a decade these days, and so when they get back together, it's a treat. Jon Doggett: You know what they say, every band that gets together starts breaking up after the first day. Geoff Cooper: Except for the Stones, right Jon? 60 years. Jon Doggett: Except for the Stones, yeah. Dusty Weis: Well, and sadly it seems like it's about time to break up this little band of ours. Ah, you see what I did there? Geoff Cooper: Well done. Jon Doggett: Yeah. Dusty Weis: I couldn't resist. Jon Doggett: All right, Geoff Cooper, CEO at the Renewable Fuels Association. It's been our pleasure, as always, catching up with you, and thank you for joining us on this discussion.

    "title": "Legislation that Would Tap Ethanol to Lower Gas Prices Secures Passage in U.S. House",
    "content": "The U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation today that would expand consumer access to higher biofuel blends that save consumers money at the pump and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. NCGA supports two biofuels provisions in the “Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act.” The provisions offer a permanent solution for maintaining year-round market access to fuels with a 15% ethanol blend, called E15, and provide additional support for infrastructure for higher biofuels blends. NCGA also endorsed the PRECISE Act, which was included in the package. “NCGA thanks Members of Congress, including Reps. Angie Craig and Cindy Axne, for advocating for biofuels as an energy security solution,” said NCGA Vice President of Public Policy Brooke S. Appleton. “We are also appreciative of the bipartisan House members who voted in favor of this bill to keep these solutions moving forward in Congress.” Renewable fuels add billions of gallons to the nation’s fuel supply every year, lowering demand for high-cost oil while increasing total fuel available to consumers. Ethanol is currently priced around $1.20 less per gallon than unblended gasoline at wholesale, and drivers are saving 30 to 40 cents or more per gallon where retailers offer E15. E15 also cuts emissions for cleaner air. The PRECISE Act, originally introduced by Rep. Ashley Hinson, helps farmers access precision agriculture technology through USDA programs. Farmers’ increased productivity, sustainability and efficiency are resulting in record corn yields using fewer resources to meet food, feed, fuel and export needs, helping keep consumer prices down in the face of high oil prices and improving environmental outcomes.",

    "title": "Fertilizer Tariffs, Shortages Taking Toll on American Farmers and Relief is Needed, National Corn Grower Leader Tells International Trade Commission",
    "content": "Shortages in nitrogen fertilizers are placing an undue burden on farmers and could eventually be detrimental to the global food supply, according to testimony provided today to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Commission (ITC). The hearing comes after CF Industries filed a petition with ITC in late 2021, requesting that the commission place tariffs on urea ammonium nitrate, which is used in liquid fertilizers imported from Russia and Trinidad and Tobago. Shortages and prices have since increased exponentially. “Some farmers are electing not to use UAN at recommended rates and, therefore, sacrificing yield because of the shortages,” said Nebraska corn grower Andy Jobman, who represented the National Corn Growers Association during the hearing. “As a farmer and agronomist, I can assure you that we study the optimal rate of UAN that should be applied and are cutting back given the shortages in the market.” This is an incredibly important issue for American farmers, Jobman told the commissioners. “Fertilizer is one of our greatest inputs,” he said. “Nitrogen fertilizers, including UAN, account for more than 50% of fertilizer expenses. Even before the tariffs went into effect in December of last year, we were paying more than 300% for UAN year-over-year.” ITC should also understand that the market needs diversity of supply, Jobman warned. “Hurricane Ida, and the resulting shutdown of one of CF Industries’ key facilities, led to shortages in the market,” he said. “Winter storms have often led to market disruptions as well when other domestic producers go off-line, and U.S. fertilizer producers also export needed production out of the United States.” The hearing marks a final phase of the investigation, with a decision expected as early as this summer.",

    "title": "Celebrating our Animal Ag Partnership During National Dairy Month",
    "content": "June is National Dairy Month, and we can’t think of a better way to celebrate than to focus on the relationship between the corn and dairy industries! Did you know that dairy cattle consume 30% of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGs), a co-product of the ethanol production process? In 2021, DDGs used 1,055 million bushels of corn. The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) engages with the dairy industry through the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy, who recently hosted the 2022 Dairy Sustainability Alliance Spring Meeting in Oak Brook, Illinois. NCGA’s Market Development Manager Michael Granché attended the conference where participants discussed sustainability in a transitioning world away from COVID-19 restrictions, the FARM ES data model, the intersection between high tech and high touch, driving profits with purpose, global methane pledges and cultivating a culture of social responsibility. “It was great to engage in such high-energy conversations around what sustainability means to the dairy industry. When you think about dairy and dairy products, they’re much closer to the consumer, so they’re really tapping into what culture means for the dairy industry and showing that both dairy production and dairy consumption are for everyone,” said Granché. “And now that it’s National Dairy Month, it’s a great time to celebrate all the hard work that goes into producing all the delicious dairy products we enjoy! So go ahead, ask for extra cheese on your burger, get the double scoop sundae, and wash it all down with a tall cold glass of chocolate milk... you know you want to!” The Dairy Sustainability Alliance membership spans the dairy value chain, and it represents a diverse cross-section of more than 160 stakeholder companies and organizations who all want to be part of dairy’s sustainability journey. Here are a few fun facts about our dairy friends: There are 93 million dairy cows in the U.S. 3% of U.S. corn exports are distributed to dairy Every $1 in exports of grain adds an additional $3.23 in business sales across the U.S. You can learn more facts about corn and dairy here.",

    "title": "2022 Renewable Fuel Volume Rule Will Lower Fuel Prices and Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions",
    "content": "The final 2022 renewable fuel volumes released today by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will support access to higher blends of ethanol, saving consumers money at the pump and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. For 2022, the final Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume of 20.63 billion gallons includes an implied 15 billion gallons of ethanol, following the law. EPA also added a supplemental 250 million gallon requirement for 2022, responding to a 2017 Court decision finding EPA improperly waived past volumes. EPA finalized the delayed 2021 volume at 18.85 billion gallons, including an implied 13.79 billion gallons for ethanol, tracking retroactive renewable fuel consumption for the year. In a separate action, EPA finalized denial of 69 pending RFS exemption petitions. Closing the books on RFS exemptions helps restore much-needed integrity to the forward-looking volumes set today. “More ethanol in the fuel supply saves Americans money at the pump and lowers greenhouse gas emissions,” said National Corn Growers Association President Chris Edgington. “Higher renewable fuel volumes for this year, which will increase and diversify our fuel supply, come at a crucial time as policymakers are working to lower fuel prices.” Ethanol is priced $1.42 less per gallon than unblended gasoline at wholesale today, and drivers currently save up to 20 cents or more per gallon where E15 is available. Ethanol reduces GHG emissions by 50% compared to gasoline and replaces the most toxic gasoline components to cut air pollution. “When President Biden visited an Iowa ethanol production facility in April, he said ethanol reduces our reliance on foreign oil, creates choice and competition at the pump for better prices, creates good-paying jobs and reduces greenhouse gas emissions,” said Edgington. “Farmers agree, and the increased RFS volumes for 2022 and denial of pending refinery exemptions will advance these objectives and move renewable fuels forward.” While Edgington praised EPA for the strong forward-looking 2022 renewable fuel volumes, he expressed disappointment the agency made an unnecessary retroactive reduction of 2020 RFS volumes. The RFS already self-adjusts for declining fuel use, such as occurred in 2020, and this further reduction rewards the use of more oil at the expense of the environment.",

    "content": "The Water Quality Working Group (WQWG)—comprised of state and national staff—assembled two weeks ago in Grasonville, Maryland, for the spring session of their biannual meetings. On Wednesday morning, the group discussed the Waters of the United States (WOTUS), NRCS Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) and the work of the Agriculture Nutrient Policy Coalition (ANPC). The afternoon included a visit to Corteva Agriscience’s Chesapeake Farms, where the group toured the grounds and learned about the conservation practices being utilized in the Chesapeake Bay. Attendees also gained insight from a Maryland grower on the area’s required nutrient management planning. Thursday’s agenda focused on state updates regarding regional policy and programs and included a discussion of the broader implications of the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the Chesapeake Bay. Panelists from the Maryland Department of Agriculture, the Delaware Nutrient Management Commission and the Delmarva Chicken Association fielded questions which were moderated by Maryland Grain Producers Executive Director Lindsay Thompson. From their organization’s perspective, each gave insights into TDML implementation and best management practices (BMPs). “The work of the Water Quality Working Group is to continue to raise awareness of the issues facing our growers and to pool our knowledge and experience into advancing conservation and advocacy efforts,” said NCGA Stewardship and Sustainability Director Rachel Orf. “Hearing grower perspective on the impacts and requirements of Chesapeake Bay’s TDML implementation help prove why we need the efforts of this working group. Being informed and proactive are a top priority in advocating for our growers.” The Water Quality Working Group brought together state corn staff representing Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio and staff from the National Corn Growers Association. The WQWG will reconvene in September of 2022.",

    "title": "EP. 34 - Mental Health: Breaking the Stigma in the Agriculture World, with Lowell Neitzel and Dr. Heather Sedges",
    "content": "With May designated as \"Mental Health Awareness Month,\" a reminder that saying something can save lives. Farmers work in a business where the finances keep getting tighter and the stakes keep getting higher. That kind of pressure takes a toll. According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the suicide rate in the agriculture industry is nearly 10 points above the national average, and about one in four farmers struggle with mental health issues. But mental health doesn’t typically get talked about a lot in the ag community. So in this episode, we meet Lowell Neitzel, a grower from Kansas who’s trying to change that by sharing his personal story about mental health. Lowell also leads the NCGA Member and Consumer Engagement Action Team, which has targeted grower mental health as a priority. Lowell is joined by Dr. Heather Sedges, an associate professor from the University of Tennessee who’s working to prioritize mental health resources for growers. Dr. Sedges serves as Principal Investigator and Lead of the USDA/NIFA-funded Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network in the Southern Region. Together, they discuss how to change the conversation about mental health in rural America, what to do when a friend or loved one is in a mental health crisis, and how to create a one-stop-shop for mental health resources that growers can use to protect their own well-being.

DIRECT SHARE TRANSCRIPT Dr. Heather Sedges: Part of the work we're doing in the Southern region is to educate mental health providers about farm issues and the stressors associated with it. Lowell Neitzel: The stigma that we're trying to break is just, if they feel like they're seen getting help by their neighbors or somebody in town, they're going to be the one getting talked about. Dusty Weis: Hello and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis. I'll be introducing your host, Association CEO Jon Doggett. From the fields of the corn belt to the D.C. Beltway, we're making sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: Farmers work in a business where the finances keep getting tighter and the stakes keep getting higher. That kind of pressure takes a toll, but mental health isn't exactly getting talked about a lot in the ag community. In this episode, we meet Lowell Neitzel, a grower from Kansas who's tried to change that by sharing his personal story about mental health, and Dr. Heather Sedges, an associate professor from the University of Tennessee, who's working to prioritize mental health resources for growers. Dusty Weis: But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also, make sure you follow the NCGA on Twitter @nationalcorn and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. With that, it's time to once again introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. Jon, today, we're going to be talking about an important topic that's near and dear to my heart. Certainly, to yours as well. Dusty Weis: According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the suicide rate amongst the agriculture industry is nearly 10 points above the national average. With estimates that approximately one in four farmers struggles with mental health issues, the need in rural America ... It's serious. Corn Growers Association understands and wants to help those around farmers understand the resources that are available and the importance of supporting people that need help. And so, Jon, I hear one of NCGA's action teams has taken up this important topic and begun working with partners across the industry to spread the message that saying something could mean everything. Jon Doggett: Dusty, we all know firsthand about too many stories, and we've seen too many tragedies. And so, this is an important podcast and one that I've been looking forward for us to have. Because this is an important issue. Today, we have with us Lowell Neitzel. Lowell farms as part of a fourth-generation family farm outside of Lawrence, Kansas. He's also the chairman of the NCGA Member and Consumer Engagement Action Team. Jon Doggett: The neat thing about Lowell is he shares his personal story as an advocate for mental health awareness and support in rural communities. I'm really looking forward to having a conversation with him and hearing part of his story on this podcast. And then, we have Dr. Heather Sedges. She is an associate professor and human development specialist in the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences with the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture. Jon Doggett: Dr. Sedges serves as the principal investigator and lead of the USDA NIFA-funded Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network in the Southern region. Dr. Sedges is a multi-award winning scholar whose work focuses on community-engaged, culturally relevant, and systems-based approach to improving quality of life in rural America. Both of you, thank you so much for being on the podcast. Lowell, we're going to turn to you first. Tell us a little. How did you come to be passionate about this issue? Lowell Neitzel: I grew up in a pretty rural community. Not a lot of sources for getting help. I watched my dad struggle for years with ongoing mental health issues. Really never did get the help that he really needed. He just kind of let himself go. Long story short, I feel like mental health played a huge role in his demise and a fairly early death. He died when he was about 68. Lowell Neitzel: That took a real big toll on me. Me and my father weren't real close there, at the end. I didn't think his passing would take such a huge toll on me, but it sure did. And I have a really strong group around me. My wife gave me the, \"Come to Jesus,\" talk and said I needed to go get some help. I love her for it. And I've been going strong ever since. Lowell Neitzel: I do have my days. Everybody has their days, but I'm in a really good spot right now. And I'm happy to be an advocate for mental health. By me telling my story, I've had so many great conversations with people that I don't even know from all over the country. It's pretty awesome that people feel comfortable with me. They just come up to me and just start talking. And that's why we're here. We're just starting that conversation. Jon Doggett: Well, we're going to come back a little bit more to your story in a minute. But in the meantime, Heather, can you tell us about the USDA NIFA-funded Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network in the Southern region? That is a mouthful of a title. Dr. Heather Sedges: Thank you so much for having me here today and congratulations on saying all of those words in order. The good news I'm happy to report is that, starting in August this year, we'll actually be renaming and rebranding to a much more pronounceable moniker. Looking forward to sharing that in the coming months here. Dr. Heather Sedges: But our region in the South is really privileged to work across our 15 states and US territories ranging from Texas all the way up to Kentucky and down and back around all the way through Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. We're really working to address the root causes of stress. There's power in knowing what we don't know. Dr. Heather Sedges: To that end, that's why we're working with organizations like NCGA and other groups like IAC, Intertribal Ag Council, the Federation of Southern Cooperatives. Or RAFI. You name it. We're trying to reach out to lots of different groups who have lots of different experiences and perspectives, so that we can have as tightly-woven of a net to catch people as possible. Dusty Weis: Heather and Lowell, I've got to say farm culture is an incredible thing. One thing that's always been incredible about it to me is the idea that there's nothing that you can't accomplish with enough hard work and determination. But along with that, comes this notion that pain is just a thing that you ignore or you power through. Dusty Weis: You rub some dirt on it. You get back out there and you get to work. That's all well and good if that's just physical pain sometimes. But when we're talking about pain on the inside, that mentality can do more harm than good. Right, Dr. Sedges? Dr. Heather Sedges: It actually changes your brain. We know through years of studies that when we are under long-term stress, which is what farmers deal with ... They're dealing with unpredictable elements. Whether it be the weather, economy, family issues, community issues. All of that. Herd health, crop health. Those are all variables that are changing all of the time. And that is stressful. What we call that kind of stress is chronic stress. Dr. Heather Sedges: And then, for farmers and ranchers and people in the ag world, what they deal with are layers of episodic ... Things that just happen in the moment that you don't expect. Acute stressors. Think about a natural disaster. Or perhaps a fertilizer issue like we're facing right now. Or a drought. What we have when we have chronic stress partnered with acute stressors is actual change in the brain. Because of the cortisol that's being released in our body. Dr. Heather Sedges: Because ultimately, we're creatures of evolution. Years ago, when a bear would chase after us ... Or actually, if a bear chased after us today, our cortisol system would go into hyperactive mode. We'd go into fight or flight mode. That's when our brain would just tell us to shut down and react and to find any soothing source that we can so that we can perceive safety. Our brain doesn't know how to differentiate between a bear chasing us or a fertilizer shortage or supply chain issue. Or not being able to find a meat processor in time. Dusty Weis: Lowell, was there a moment in your personal story when you had that realization? Where you realized, \"Oh my God. It feels like there's a bear chasing me.\" How did you work through that personally? Lowell Neitzel: I was always pretty goal-oriented. When I woke up in the morning, \"I'm going to try to get this many acres covered,\" if I was planting. Or, \"I'm going to try to get this many bales bailed,\" if I was running the round bailer. And if I had a breakdown or a weather event, I just felt like the whole world was going to come to an end. Just because I didn't reach my goal for the day. Lowell Neitzel: That took huge toll on me. It'd be something I worried about for the rest of the week or couple of weeks. \"Man, if I'd have been able to get that a hundred acres, I'd be done with this already. I missed out because I broke down or the rain got me.\" It's been those little things that I've had to try to figure out that ... It's okay that I don't get everything done in one day that I think I need to get done. Lowell Neitzel: I was lucky to have a really good therapist to help me get the stuff I needed. We even talked about getting me some medication. And I talked with some friends that were on some medication. They told me that it's made a world of difference in their life. With their confidence and their backing, I was willing to give it a try. And it's made a world of difference in my life. Jon Doggett: I'm from Montana and we have, unfortunately, a very high rate of suicide. One of the many factors that are part of that is the lack of mental health professionals in rural communities. Lowell, you've talked about therapy and I've done that as well. What kind of stigma is there still? I'm going to ask Lowell, you first, and I'm going to ask Heather, you second. What kind of stigma is there about therapy and how do we overcome some of that? Lowell Neitzel: Good question. That's one I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around a little bit. My generation and the generation younger than me, I think they're okay with talking. They've probably seen their families and their parents struggle from time to time. A lot of them don't want to go through those struggles, and they think it's okay to talk. Lowell Neitzel: Because probably they've seen people in their life like me talk about it. They're okay with talking about it. Or they're willing to go get help. Because this younger generation is wired a little different than the rest of the farming community, I feel. I feel like they're open to a lot more things. They're willing to do things that the older generation isn't. Lowell Neitzel: The stigma that we're trying to break is just, I feel like a lot of them ... If they feel like they're seen getting help by their neighbors or somebody in town, they're going to be the one getting talked about. \"So-and-so was at the doctor's office today. I wonder what's wrong with him? He must not be feeling good. Or he might not be feeling all right.\" In a little town, gossip is everything. And so, we don't want to be the center of the gossip. For sure. Lowell Neitzel: Another thing. This older generation, my grandparents, my parents taught me that we're tough as nails. You're not supposed to worry about getting help. You sit in the tractor and you think about it and you get through it. Well, you sit in the tractor and you think about it. Sometimes you get in that rabbit hole and there's no getting out of it. It's just a crazy thing to think. We just need to get rid of that stigma. It's okay to go get help. Dr. Heather Sedges: Lowell, I have a little theory here. I think the reason that younger generations are increasingly more willing to talk about mental health and options to cope with stress are because of people like you, who are brave enough to be the leaders and to go out there and be vulnerable and talk about it. Big kudos to you for that. Dr. Heather Sedges: I really do. I think, over the past 30 years, we've seen a big difference, both in media and in interpersonal connections, in being able to be vulnerable and talking about issues that are unseen to so many. But I also think that a lot of times people don't always engage with what I like to call, \"The tools in our toolbox.\" Dr. Heather Sedges: Those in the ag world, we all have tools in our toolbox. Whether it's a pair pliers or whether it is maybe going to talk to a therapist or taking medication. I think one of the reasons that we struggle with the stigma is really all about fear of the unknown. We're not sure what to expect. Are we going to walk in and be lying on a couch? Is somebody going to tell us all the things that are wrong with us? Dr. Heather Sedges: Are we going to inadvertently increase our risk for someone to come in and say, \"They're not running their farm in an effective manner.\" Or, \"They're not able to manage their herd.\" That opens up a lot of vulnerabilities for farmers and ranchers. And so, really understanding the operating principles behind the stigma. What's causing that? Jon Doggett: The first time you go to a therapist is the hardest time. Or the first time you go to a 12-step meeting is the hardest one you'll ever go to. And so, it's getting beyond that initial fear of the unknown. I've thought sometimes we almost need a video of, \"This is what it's like going the first time. It won't kill you.\" Dr. Heather Sedges: Lowell said something interesting earlier about the importance that his wife played in being supportive. I can't underscore the importance enough of having people who are supportive in your life. I have been able and honored and humbled to play that role for others, but also been the recipient of it. Dr. Heather Sedges: And it's as simple as saying, \"Can I help you make a phone call? Let's do that right now in the moment.\" Really being ready to step into that space. Knowing that the answers are not all known and that's okay. Jon Doggett: Why are so many of us involved in agriculture, so many of us who are from rural areas ... Why is it that we're so afraid of taking care of ourselves? I said to a friend of mine a couple weeks ago, \"I really wasn't feeling well and I took the afternoon off.\" And I said to her, \"I feel kind of guilty about that.\" Jon Doggett: She said, \"There you go. There's that country kid thing again about, \"You're not going to take care of yourself.\" You're embarrassed that you didn't feel good, so you took the afternoon off?\" How much of that is out there? How much of it is ... Lowell said we're tough. We're going to hang in there and just keep on going. Lowell Neitzel: It just goes back to that mentality. I watched grandma and grandpa and my mom and dad just fight tooth and nail to survive. They were out there when they were sick and out there at all times of the days and nights. Checking calves and doing all kinds of fun stuff like that. And so, I think that just translates into my mind that if I got a little tickle on my throat, I can't be at home sucking off cough drops. Lowell Neitzel: I got to be at the farm doing what I know needs to get done. Even though I know my family's there at the farm and they're very capable of doing what I could be there doing. I could be at home getting healthier. Resting instead of maybe making everybody else sick. But it just goes back to that thing that we're hardwired with. It's just hard to get over sometimes. Dr. Heather Sedges: I'm going to be the nerd for a minute here. I'm going to cite some research. I'm particularly citing an article by Dr. Rosmann from 2010. And the title of the article is called The Agrarian Imperative. It was in the Journal of Agromedicine. In this article, he talked about the genetic precursors that are embedded in us and then pass through our generations. Dr. Heather Sedges: He uncovered this through genetic and anthropological evidence that suggests that acquiring territories of land ... And I'm quoting directly from the abstract here. That acquiring territories of land to produce necessities has an inherited basis that is encoded into our genetic material. What does this mean? Dr. Heather Sedges: I know that this means, for us, the way we're translating that is ... It's hard. If we are supposed to be producers, producing something, and that is not happening as effectively as we have conjured in our minds or pictured in our minds? Then, we have this innate tendency to think, \"I'm not doing well. Something is wrong.\" It kicks in that whole notion of quote, \"I am bad.\" Or, \"I could do better.\" Dusty Weis: Heather, we've covered a lot of the micro so far on this of how this impacts individual people and some ways that they can begin to cope with that. You mentioned earlier the USDA NIFA-funded Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network in the Southern region. How is your organization and your affiliation with that working on this problem on the macro level? Dr. Heather Sedges: Thank you so much for asking about that. And I appreciate that you actually mentioned the macro level. Because in the Southern region, what we're really focusing on is understanding and addressing the very root causes of farmer stress. Yes. We could create programs and fact sheets and webinars to address ways that farmers and ranchers and foresters too could be managing their stress. Dr. Heather Sedges: But what we're doing in addition to that is working upstream with partners to understand and mitigate the issues that are causing the stressors. This means engagement with risk management organizations. This means educating farm families about effective succession planning. Or crop health, herd health. Making sure that there are resources for farmers in a one-stop, easy to find place. What our region is working on right now is curating all those resources. Supports go to organizations. Into a place that someone can go to. Dr. Heather Sedges: Particularly, if they're in crisis. For instance, answer one question on a website that says, \"How are you doing today? What's on your mind?\" The backend analytics or the backend database will then help them source through what kind of resources they need to be connected to. We're really working from a systems-level approach. We are engaging with organizations throughout the country, in addition to the Southern region, to focus on ways that we can mitigate those root causes of stress. Dr. Heather Sedges: We're doing that through a hotline that will be in collaboration with numerous partners at the national level that are farmers themselves. When you pick up that phone line, it's not just a random person that has no idea what's going on in farming or ag. It's someone who's been there done that. It's people who know the connections for loan remediation programs and can understand some of the very nuanced issues that go into that. It's also having this website that will be able to navigate people to the resources and communities of support that they need. Jon Doggett: I think that's an important thing that you just mentioned, Heather, that there is nuance to folks providing some of this assistance. What I hear from farmers as we moved into this space several years ago ... I heard over and over again, \"Well, we've got to make sure that whoever's answering that phone on that hotline knows a little bit about agriculture.\" And that is important. Jon Doggett: I'm so glad to hear that more and more of those hotlines are available with skilled people that understand the mental health side, understand the need for help side, but also understand that ... February, March, for a lot of folks, they're calving. April, May, they're trying to get a crop in the ground. In the fall, they're trying to get one off the field. Those are important things to understand when you're having that conversation with somebody who is in a crisis. Jon Doggett: Yet, it might just not be that the mental health crisis is there. But in the meantime, they also got to check the heifers that night. How do you get all of that done? It is a very significant difference between our industry and others. Heather, where are we with having adequate mental health professionals in rural America? I know that answer here in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. Jon Doggett: I have some good friends that are trying to get some mental health professionals for their child. They're having a heck of a time here in a reasonably affluent community. If we're having trouble finding mental health professionals in Northern Virginia ... How hard is it in rural America? What are we doing about it and what do we need to do about it? What action should we all be taking to support that? That's a multifaceted question. Dr. Heather Sedges: All right. Well, I'm glad I drank my coffee this morning. You're right. The availability of mental health providers in rural communities is very low. We know that. The good news is that, over the past couple of years, we've become more comfortable with online telehealth options. They've become increasingly reimbursable. Things like telehealth and connecting to therapeutic options online is really changing the face of available resources in rural communities. Dr. Heather Sedges: An important aspect to remember with signs and symptoms that we're looking for in our friends and family members are risk factors. One of the biggest risk factors is age. We know that 45% of farmers who unfortunately complete suicide are above the age of 65. Another risk factor is veteran status. We have so many farmers who have also served our country. We know that some of the risk factors that go along with returning increase our risk for contemplating suicide. Dr. Heather Sedges: We also want to take into consideration farmers in minority groups. Black farmers, latino farmers, indigenous farmers, women farmers. These are important groups, because they may not have as strong a sense of community around them. Pay attention to those risk factors. The other ways that we can be addressing this too are by educating people that are proximal to ag producers. Dr. Heather Sedges: That means individuals like your family doctor, faith-based organizations. Something that happened recently is that all FSA employees were trained in a mental health literacy program. When they're working with people on their loans, they're going to be able to be aware of the signs and symptoms that may be concerning and be able to route them to a tool in a toolbox that they can use. Jon Doggett: Lowell, how hard was it for you to find a mental health professional in your area when you were looking for one? Lowell Neitzel: I'm pretty fortunate. I live in a pretty populated area, so I was able to find one fairly easily. The kicker was that I had to spend some of my session educating my provider about why stuff on the farm was stressing me out. She had grown up in kind of a rural area, but she was a city kid. She didn't really understand the nuances of farm life and working with family and what working multi-generations on one operation can do to a person. Lowell Neitzel: And so, it was frustrating on one hand and it was refreshing on the other hand. Because she had that separation. And so, she was able to give me stuff to look at from an outsider's perspective that I wasn't really looking at myself. And so, at the time, I was like, \"I don't know if she's really helping me.\" But looking at it now, several years later, I feel like she did do me a big favor and a big service and gave me a lot of tools to put in my toolbox. Lowell Neitzel: That was just one of my many journeys with a therapist. And it's been a struggle to find somebody to know what's going on the ag side. But at the same time, I can work with the people that I need to get help from and make it work. Dr. Heather Sedges: Lowell, you'll be heartened to know, I hope, that part of the work we're doing in the Southern region is to educate mental health providers about farm issues and the stressors associated with it. In fact, in early August, we're having a summit in Tennessee. Dr. Heather Sedges: Specifically, to cross over the ag professionals with mental health professionals and help them understand each other's field and what's going on there. We're going to try to help with that, but we're going to still need people educating others as they go along. Lowell Neitzel: That's awesome. Jon Doggett: Heather, top thing on your wishlist that you think would do the most good for the most people the quickest. What would that be? Do we need more federal money? Do we need more state money? We can always throw taxpayer dollars at everything. That's kind of the way we do things in this country. But really, what's needed that policymakers need to do to address some of this? Dr. Heather Sedges: A couple of things. One, and I don't know that policymakers can do this, but we need more people like Lowell. We need people ready to step into that space and be open and know that the sky will not fall if you share what you are going through. In fact, it'll lift other people out of the darkness and you'll find a community that can be supportive to you. I think, number one, we need more people like that. Dr. Heather Sedges: Second of all, we need it to be easy for people to access care. Whether that's broadband accessibility to enhance telehealth options. Or whether that's funding initiatives to get more providers out into communities. Or whether that's having some kind of certification program that can cross-train individuals that are already in a field adjacent to agriculture. Jon Doggett: My wife was in education for 31 years. She retired about five, six years ago. She still comes back to her old school district several weeks a year to fill in. It's part of a program that they have. One of the things she has noticed since the pandemic is just this surge of kids that need mental health help. She was really alarmed last fall when she was in our local school district. Jon Doggett: She said, \"You finally get the kid ready to say, \"Okay, I need some help.\" Then, you got to convince the kid's parents that the kid needs help. That's harder.\" And then, she saw too many times over just a short period of time that ... We finally got everybody ready to say, \"This kid needs some help and they're willing to get some help.\" Now, we can't get help. There's a waiting list. Jon Doggett: What do you say to folks that are in a real difficult spot? They're running up against, \"I can't find a provider. I can't do this.\" What do you tell them, Lowell, to get them through the next couple days until they can find somebody to help them find somebody? Lowell Neitzel: The one thing that I find that helps me when I get in a bad spot, and I don't think I have the time to run to the therapist, or get me scheduled on an appointment ... I call somebody that I talked with in the past. I talk with a lot of NCGA staff on almost a daily basis. They know me very well. I know them very well. Lowell Neitzel: I can open up and I feel like I'm in a safe space. I have several friends that are usually in a tractor, just like I am. We have a lot of that in common. And so, sometimes I'll call, not knowing that I needed to talk. We just travel down that path. We talk about the kids, talk about the weather, talk about breakdowns. Talk about the older generation, why they're making us mad. Why can't they do this right? Why can't they do that right? Lowell Neitzel: But at the end of the day, we'll hang up, say our goodbyes and feel better. It's weird that we can connect with each other on so many different levels. At the end of the day, we feel so much better. Even though we're not professionals. We're just speaking what's on our mind and we're getting deep. Sometimes getting a little deep and a little in the weeds is okay. Lowell Neitzel: That's what we need to do. And it's okay. The one thing I really tell everybody is, \"It's okay to not be okay.\" Just call that one guy or one gal or one person that has your back and that would do anything for you. It could be your mom and your dad, your aunt, your uncle. A former teacher. Or one of your best friends. Just call them. And if they don't answer, just keep calling them until they do answer. Then, just start unloading on them. They'll listen. Jon Doggett: I think I've heard that referred to as strength in your vulnerabilities. Dr. Heather Sedges: We're pack animals. We find safety in groups. When we can connect with other people, it actually releases endorphins in our brain in ways. When we find connection and an ability to feel safe. If someone's not able to access care immediately, I always say, \"Just provide a splint.\" So if you fell and you broke your ankle, what are you going to do? Dr. Heather Sedges: You're not just going to drag it along. You're going to splint it. Right? Same thing with this. Find a splint. Whether it is watching something funny on TV, just to get your mind out of that space. Or whether it's just saying to someone, \"Hey. I don't feel like being alone right now.\" It's really that simple. Dusty Weis: Heather, a moment ago, you said that the world needs more people like Lowell out there telling their stories and destigmatizing this. I think there's a lot of wisdom in that. Lowell, I know that in addition to your involvement at the Corn Growers Association, you put together a video with them. It's a video on YouTube where you tell your story there as well. Dusty Weis: Anybody who's interested can check out that video at ncga.ws/farmhealth, but we'll also put a link in the episode description here. But Lowell, I wanted to ask you, how did that come about? How did NCGA's team come to embrace and elevate the importance of doing work in this area? Lowell Neitzel: We got approached a couple years ago by the NCGA board. They said, \"We've got some funding and we're going to put it in your portfolio. Please run with it.\" And so, we're not trying to reinvent the wheel by any means, but we're just trying to make it work. Because NCGA covers so many states. And so, we're trying to appease people in Ohio, Kansas, Colorado, Wisconsin, Michigan. Lowell Neitzel: And so, we have so many places that we're trying to make everything work together for a greater cause. How I got involved with it and had our video done ... We had some really great photographers and some filmmakers that are on staff as contractors. And so, I was actually scheduled to do a shoot with them at my farm in Lawrence, in August. Adnan has known me for a while and he knew my story and how comfortable I was with telling my story. Lowell Neitzel: He was filming some stuff in the tractor and he's like, \"Hey. We're going to try this.\" He grabbed one of these camera grabs and said, \"Hey. Get in on this and let's see where this goes.\" And so, he asked me some questions. And I was in my element. I was in my tractor cab. And so, that's my happy space. We just started going and he asked me some questions. And then, it ended up being really good. Lowell Neitzel: I showed that to my aunt and my wife. Adnan is amazing. They all cried the first time they saw it, because my grandpa is in that. They all knew how important he was to me and how important he was to them. Honestly, the first time I saw it, I really got emotional and I couldn't hardly handle it. It's just amazing. The power of a message. Especially, one that has done very well. I can't thank Adnan and his team enough. So great to have them as a team member to us. Dusty Weis: Again, we'll put a link to that video in the episode description here. But I would say that, anybody who's listening that knows someone who they want to get on the path to getting help. I think they should probably grab that video and send them an email. Or send it to them on Facebook or whatever your preferred method of communication is. Dusty Weis: Because it is powerful, Lowell. It was powerful what they did in telling that story. But it was powerful that you stood up and told that it in the first place. And so, thank you so much for doing that. Lowell Neitzel: You bet. Dusty Weis: Lowell, obviously, you've taken this on as a personal mission in your life, but talk a little bit more about ... You chair the team. Your team could have taken off and done a lot of things that are a little bit more traditional. Talk about membership and prizes for bringing in more members. Get that discount on the pickup or whatever. Dusty Weis: But you went off into a different direction and you've pushed it hard. How have you seen the evolution of your team and the team members? Where has that gone? Have you been surprised at what the response was in your team and how they have pushed forward to deal with these issues? Lowell Neitzel: I first took over the team in the middle of COVID. Our first in-person meeting with meeting the whole team was over Zoom. I knew a lot of my team, but you still don't get that personal touch. Or the involvement, so to speak. We actually got together last year in New Orleans. The person that was in charge of trying to help us find some stuff was struggling. Had a lot of people tell her that, \"This is great. We're going to be involved.\" Lowell Neitzel: When they went to throw their hat in the ring, they backed out and said, \"We're going to go a different direction.\" Or, \"So-and-so reached out to us. We're going to go with them instead of you guys.\" We got done with her presentation, because she was on Zoom, and I jumped up and I said how frustrating it was that nobody wants to help us. Lowell Neitzel: I got on my soapbox and I just ran it and raved. We went to lunch and I came back and it was amazing. My team grabbed me and said, \"I'm so glad you're so passionate about this, because this is a big thing.\" My team is unique where I have some growers and I have a lot of state staff members on my team. A lot of my state staff members grabbed me and said, \"You know how important other farmers are to me? They need to hear what you are so passionate about.\" Lowell Neitzel: I feel like they've got my back and I certainly got theirs. So if they call me and say, \"Hey. What do you think about this?\" I'm a very good sounding board for them. I use a couple of them quite a bit for a sounding board for myself. They are awesome. This is something that is very passionate to most of them. I've seen them in action, when we get to talking about this. How they light up, because they know this is making a difference in somebody's life that they're involved with directly. It's awesome. Jon Doggett: Heather, let's take an example. Do you have a farmer or a member of a farm family that is in acute distress? Very serious situation? What's the first place they ought to reach? What's that first phone call that they ought to make? Where can they find some help? Because it is daunting to find that help. What would be the first one or two places that you would suggest somebody to go to? Dr. Heather Sedges: Well, first of all, there's not one solution for every single person. My answer to you is, \"It really depends,\" which is not clean and easy for anybody to hear. That's why in the Southern region, we're really working to gather all of the resources, so that it's a one-stop shop where farmers can go to figure out where they should go. Dr. Heather Sedges: We're only in the beginning building phases right now. We're not quite there yet. In the interim, I think reaching out to local organizations that provide support. Sometimes that looks like your local faith-based group. Sometimes that looks like reaching out to a group ... For instance, in North Carolina, we have North Carolina Agromedicine Institute. Dr. Heather Sedges: Farmers are quite familiar with the Ag Safety folks or AgrAbility programs. Those are great places to go, because they understand the need to amend how we work in order to stay productive. I'm always going to say Extension. We have great resources throughout the country and increasingly Extension offices and institutions are really addressing this issue. Those are some of the top resources that I would say. Jon Doggett: You aren't always going to get the help that you necessarily need with the first phone call or the second phone call. But this is so important to make the third, fourth, or 82nd phone call. If that's what it's going to take. Dr. Heather Sedges: Until our Southern region has this all solved and figured out. We're getting there. Let me tell you something. We're working day and night on it, but it's having the fortitude to stick with it. And that's something that farmers have. Engaging in whatever that splint is. Reaching out to someone who can walk that walk with you to making all of the phone calls. Because quite frankly, when you're in the midst of it all, it's really exhausting. You just don't want to have to make one more phone call or explain your story one more time. Dr. Heather Sedges: Having someone who can do that for you ... Sometimes all it takes is making it a little bit easier on yourself. That might be jotting down a few notes that you can read off to people when you're talking to them, so that you don't always have to be pulling from your own memory. You can just say, \"Here's my list of symptoms. Here's what I'm going through. How can you help me?\" Just jotting some things down and having that readily available can be pretty powerful in helping you feel like you can have the stamina to continue reaching out. Jon Doggett: So many times one of the main symptoms of mental illness is that piece that keeps you from dealing with the mental illness. It's a circular thing, \"I feel horrible. I feel awful. But I feel so bad, I can't get the help I need.\" And that's the scary part of this. Dr. Heather Sedges: We have a resource that I developed here in Tennessee and it's available to anyone. I can actually share a link with you all. It's called the Productivity Protocol. It's something you do when you're healthy, when you're feeling good. Just like we have a protocol for addressing mastitis in dairy heifers. And so, we have protocol. We know what we're supposed to be doing in certain situations. Dr. Heather Sedges: Well, I developed what I'm calling the Productivity Protocol. It's literally just, \"Hey. Here are the signs and symptoms that I should be recognizing in myself for when to be concerned. What should I do when that happens?\" It's a step-by-step worksheet that you can post on the back of a door in your shop or in your barn or maybe on your tractor. Dr. Heather Sedges: Put it in a Ziploc bag and have it right there in your tractor. Run through it and check yourself. Because ultimately, it's about remaining productive on the farm. Right? We want to keep being able to do what we need to do. Having a resource like that can be also be really helpful to people. Lowell Neitzel: Absolutely, Heather. I was given a worksheet similar to what you're talking about by one of my therapists that I was seeing. When you work through it, you realize that your day isn't as bad as you played it off in your head. And so, it makes a world of difference. I actually shared that with my team. They're like, \"Holy cow, that is a really great source.\" Kudos for that. Awesome. Dusty Weis: Well, Heather, as you said, there are a number of resources that are out there. We are actually going to compile a list of those and clickable links. We're going to put those in the episode description, so anybody that needs to run through that protocol can find it there. But Jon, do you have anything else to add at this point? Jon Doggett: Dusty, I just want to thank Heather and Lowell so much for the work that they have done on this issue. Heather is going to be with our action team meetings in July, in Washington, D.C. Looking forward to meeting her in person. And of course, Lowell is continuing his work. Not only on the farm, but with his team that he cherishes so well and tells his story so well. Thank you so much for all that you've done on this. The courage and the compassion you've shown in speaking out and letting folks know that they're not alone. Jon Doggett: I want to close by urging farm families and industry partners and those that care for farmers to look for signs. It seems intimidating. It seems that's something completely out of what most of us do most of the time. But it's vital. Saying something can truly mean everything and not saying something can lead to some bad things. And so, we need to help one another. Jon Doggett: I think that's what we're here for, is to help one another, and to see people become everything that they can be. Certainly, this is an important thing for our organization. And I know it's important to the folks that are listening to this podcast. I'm Jon Doggett.

    "title": "NCGA President Provides Input on Pending Renewable Fuel Standard Volumes",
    "content": "A strong 2022 volume requirement under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is important as American leaders seek to lower gas prices, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and deal with inflation, said National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) President Chris Edgington to federal agency staff during a Monday meeting on the final RFS volume rule currently under review. Corn growers support the proposed 2022 RFS numbers, Edgington told the Office of Management and Budget and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency staff. But he reiterated NCGA’s concerns with EPA’s proposal of retroactive 2021 volumes below actual use and the proposed reopening and revising already final 2020 standards. “It’s important to share our perspective on corn supply and corn growers’ increasing productivity and sustainability, which allow us to meet demand for food, feed, fuel and exports with bushels to spare,” said Edgington. “Americans are feeling the effects of inflation, and they see the connection between high oil prices and higher food costs. Blending more ethanol, which costs less and increases the fuel supply by billions of gallons, helps in remedying this situation.” Edgington referenced a recent survey conducted by Morning Consult that showed that 92% of adults are concerned about inflation, 69% are very concerned about the cost of gas, and 65% said they were very concerned about the cost of groceries. The survey also showed that consumers correctly hold higher oil prices and inflation responsible for higher food prices, not biofuels, illustrating the importance of bringing down fuel costs, Edgington noted. Ethanol has been priced an average of 80 cents less per gallon than unblended gasoline at wholesale through the spring. Today’s technology has enabled farmers to increase yields on each acre to produce more corn for food, feed and fuel needs using less land and fewer resources, Edgington told OMB. EPA is under a June 3 deadline to issue final RFS volume requirements for 2022 and delayed volumes for 2021.",

The proposed rule removes the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, eliminating the long-overdue certainty and clarity for farmers affected by the scope of WOTUS jurisdiction. Dwyer will offer her remarks at 4 p.m. (Eastern) today, which can be viewed here.",

    "title": "Ag Groups Call For Withdrawal of Solicitor Generals Supreme Court Brief on Glyphosate That Would Create a Patchwork of Problems",
    "content": "In a letter to President Biden, 54 agricultural groups expressed grave concern with a recent amicus brief submitted by the U.S. Solicitor General to the Supreme Court advising the court against taking up a case regarding pesticide labels. The groups, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Cotton Council, and American Sugarbeet Growers Association, listed in full here in the letter, called on the president to swiftly withdraw the brief. They warned the new policy would set a dangerous precedent that threatens the science-based regulatory process. The groups are worried this new policy, along with having environmental impacts, could ultimately hinder the ability of U.S. farmers to help meet growing global food needs intensified by the invasion of Ukraine. In the May 10 brief, the Solicitor General advised the court against taking up a case concerning whether state pesticide labels can conflict with federal labels. Brad Doyle, soy farmer from Arkansas and president of the American Soybean Association, stated, “Federal law is clear that pesticide labels cannot be false or misleading. Allowing states to require health warnings contrary to decades of sound science is beyond disturbing and obviously not in line with federal law. I and other farmers are concerned this new policy will open the floodgate to a patchwork of state labels that will undermine grower access to safe, effective pesticides needed to farm productively and sustainably.” At question is whether the state of California can require a cancer warning label for the popular herbicide glyphosate when thousands of studies, decades of robust scientific consensus, and numerous global regulatory bodies—including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency—agree the herbicide is not a carcinogen. The new position expressed by the Solicitor General is a stunning reversal from previous, bipartisan administrative policy. The brief asserts federal law and regulations do not prevent states from imposing their own labeling requirements, even if those labels run counter to federal findings. \"Supplying wheat to the world is more important than ever given the unprecedented times with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Together, Russia and Ukraine make up one-third of the world’s wheat exports, and the disruptions we are seeing will certainly impact food supply,” said National Association of Wheat Growers President and Washington wheat farmer, Nicole Berg. “Aside from the war, U.S. wheat growers are experiencing extreme weather conditions threatening the quality of their crops this year. 75% of the winter wheat production in the U.S. is in a severe drought. NAWG is concerned this new policy would undermine access to safe and effective crop protection tools that play a critical role in helping feed the world.\" AFBF President Zippy Duval said, “Farmers utilize science-backed crop protection tools on their farms to produce safe, nutritious food. Allowing labels that conflict with existing conclusions and EPA studies will add to a greater misunderstanding of the crucial role pesticides play in enabling farmers to grow healthy, affordable food for America’s families.\" Nate Hultgren, sugarbeet farmer from Minnesota and president of the American Sugarbeet Growers Association said, “Farmers can’t meet consumers’ food security needs and help address climate change if the safe crop protection products we use and desperately need are undermined by the states. Allowing states to supersede federal pesticide labeling requirements will create massive uncertainty, confusion and add to significant supply chain disruptions.” “In the coming months, farmers will have to work even harder to address worldwide food shortages, and a patchwork of state regulations will jeopardize access to the critical farm supplies they need,” said National Corn Growers Association President Chris Edgington. “We hope the Biden administration will reverse its position on this issue.” The groups call on President Biden to withdraw the brief. They also encourage the president to consult with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to better understand the implications of this decision for science-based regulation, as well as food security and environmental sustainability.",

    "content": "Approximately one in four farmers struggle with mental health issues. NCGA asks farmers, their families, and the people they do business with to look for signs. NCGA’s Member and Consumer Engagement Action Team (MCEAT) distributed a short, one-minute video asking our industry partners to assist in this effort. Working with allies in the lending communities, retailer networks, grain elevator operators, and others, we are distributing this video widely throughout our networks and helping raise awareness. “The Membership and Consumer Engagement Action Team has a real passion for this topic,” said Dan Nerud, vice chair of MCEAT and a farmer from Nebraska. “We wanted to do something in this space that would have a real impact. A lot of organizations have done great work on creating resources. We decided that continuing to raise awareness amongst our closest industry partners, those who we see and interact with almost daily, had the potential to bring something unique to the conversation and could yield material results.” The video was released during Mental Health Awareness Month to amplify NCGA’s outreach to farmers on this critical issue. “Mental Health Awareness Month is an important opportunity to help us normalize this topic,” said Lowell Neitzel, chairman of MCEAT and Kansas farmer. “Many farmers tend to be stoic by nature. But it’s important for us to realize that we don’t face these challenges alone, and it helps to talk about them.” According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the suicide rate amongst the agriculture industry is nearly ten points above the national average.

    "content": "President Biden announced today that he is appointing Alexis Taylor as undersecretary for trade and U.S. agricultural affairs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Taylor, currently the director of the Oregon Department of Agriculture, has extensive experience working on agricultural issues. “I have known Alexis in a professional capacity for well over a decade, and she is someone with a deep understanding of agriculture, particularly as it relates to foreign markets, and she is widely respected by policymakers on both sides of the aisle,” said Brooke S. Appleton, vice president of public policy at the National Corn Growers Association. “I cannot think of a better person to represent the Biden administration on this issue.” Taylor has served as a policy expert on ag issues for several members of Congress on Capitol Hill and managed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services. An Iraq veteran, Taylor grew up in Iowa on her family’s 160-year-old farm. Taylor’s nomination will now go before the Senate for final confirmation.",

    "title": "In Visit to Illinois Farm, Biden Commits to Helping Growers",
    "content": "Appearing on an Illinois family farm, President Biden announced today that his administration would be giving farmers additional tools and resources to boost crop production and maintain global food security. The announcement comes as the administration is working to help farmers, American consumers and food insecure communities around the globe who are feeling the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “American corn growers continue to feed and fuel the world even as they face challenges stemming from the war in Ukraine and high input costs,” said National Corn Growers Association CEO Jon Doggett, who attended the announcement. “We’re appreciative of the efforts that President Biden and USDA are making to help farmers navigate these challenges, and the recognition of the key role farmers play in providing solutions.” During his announcement, Biden committed to: Increase the number of counties eligible for double cropping insurance, which will allow farmers to plant a second crop on the same land in the same year, helping boost production without relying on farmers to substitute crops or cultivate new land. Cut costs for farmers by increasing technical assistance for technology-driven precision agriculture, resulting in less fertilizer usage without reducing yields. Double the previously announced funding for domestic fertilizer production to ensure accessibility of this critical input for growers. Today’s announcement is the latest in a series of efforts by the administration to help lower costs for farmers and American consumers. In April, the president visited an Iowa ethanol production facility to announce the administration’s extension of full market access for higher ethanol blends through the summer months, increasing the fuel supply through greater use of low-cost and low-emissions ethanol.",

    "content": "At the Advanced Bioeconomy Leadership Conference (ABLC) in Washington D.C., the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) held a session on Corn-to-Chemicals, outlining the uses of corn as an industrial feedstock. The panel was moderated by McKay, and participants included John Hannon, COO, Vertimass; Nathan Danielson, Principal, BioCognito; Erick Lutt, Senior Director, Biotechnology Innovation Organization and Jessica Bowman, Executive Director, Plant Based Products Council. The panel highlighted the evolution of the biotechnology industry and how each organization is working to overcome barriers to commercialization. Further, the panel had a robust Q&A session with the audience on programs and policies, including national incentives for biobased materials. “U.S. corn farmers continue to produce an affordable, high quality and reliable crop each year,” said NCGA Market Development Director Sarah McKay. “That crop can be turned into more than just food, feed and fuel. The corn kernel can be utilized in so many ways, which is why we focus on new uses and corn as an industrial feedstock.” Vertimass was a winner of NCGA’s first Consider Corn Challenge. If all 15 winners of the Consider Corn Challenge I, II and III were fully commercialized, it would approximate 3.4 billion bushels of added corn demand. NCGA continues work in the new uses and industrial feedstock space through the Consider Corn Challenge, a partnership with DigestData, continued conversations with government agencies like the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO), and expanded focus on a potential national incentive program.

    "title": "EP. 33 4-Time National Corn Yield Contest Record Holder David Hulas Winning Formula",
    "content": "Along the banks of the James River in Virginia, David Hula is harvesting some real bin-busters. The NCGA National Corn Yield Contest is an annual tradition that dates back to 1965. But in that time, no one has had quite the sustained success as Charles City, Virginia’s David Hula, who has won the contest with record-setting yields on four separate occasions. In this episode, we talk to David about his formula for success, which includes a combination of precisely-targeted fertilizer applications and a blend of strip-till and no-till. Plus, we discuss the unique environmental challenges he faces as he works tirelessly to preserve water quality in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and how his farm traces its historic roots back to a time when growers planted a dead catfish with their corn seed. DIRECT SHARE LINK TRANSCRIPT David Hula: I like to say there's three great things that produce high yield and corn. A good Lord blesses you. Number two, you got to have Pioneer seed. Number three, you got to have John Deere paint. So with those, that's easy. But it's a whole system, Jon, that takes it from the planter to in-season management to harvesting. Dusty Weis: Hello and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host. Association CEO, Jon Doggett. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC, Beltway. We're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: The National Corn Yield Contest is an annual tradition that dates back to 1965. And with thousands of entries every year from across the country, earning any recognition in this competition is noteworthy. But winning it four times and regularly setting new yield records, well, David Hula from Charles City, Virginia is pretty unique in that distinction. In this episode, he'll tell us about his historic family farm, what techniques he uses, and why real sustainability is at the heart of what he does. But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also, make sure you follow the NCGA on Twitter @nationalcorn and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. Dusty Weis: And with that, it's time to once again introduce, Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. And Jon, today we're going to be talking about the highlight of every growing season since about 1965, NCGA's National Corn Yield Contest. Every year, thousands of growers toss their hats into the ring to see if they can grow like champions. And win state or national awards in nine different classes covering different soil types, irrigation, and tillage methods. Jon Doggett: Dusty the yield contest. It's just a lot of fun. It's fun for its entrants. And it's fun for those of us that get to watch it and to see the great things they're doing. It's an important demonstration of just how innovative and ingenious growers are by pushing that envelope of corn production. The contest opens the 1st of May, runs through mid-August. We average about 7,400 entries nationwide. Now, just think about that. You got that many people out there competing and doing their best and trying some really cool and neat and innovative things. Jon Doggett: So joining us today is a man who's really responsible for some true bin busters, David Hula from Charles City, Virginia. He's a four-time record holder. He continues to top his own record yields. This is what I think is interesting. His grandfather was one of the first in his area to break 100 bushels. Then his dad broke 200 bushels. Then David was the one of the first to break 300, and then 400, and then 500. And back in 2019, he raised 616.195 bushels per acre. Now, let me repeat that because that's just pretty cool, 616.195 bushels per acre. Now, that is just amazing. Jon Doggett: And then, David, you had 602 bushels per acre in last year's contest. You're the only grower to surpass 600 bushels per acre not once but twice. So David, welcome. Tell us about you. Tell us about your farm. Tell us about how you ended up there. We had a little of that conversation before we started. So tell us about who you are. David Hula: Well, Mr. Jon, it was my late granddad, then my dad, and then we've had success, but wouldn't you hate to be my son? Just imagine the pressure on that. Dusty Weis: Set a high bar. David Hula: That's exactly right. So I am fortunate. I got to farm with my late granddad and my dad. And my uncle. He since passed away. Farming's a dangerous occupation to start out with. And we had a tragedy here on the farm and lost my uncle. And my dad just passed away last December. COVID got him. So now it's just myself, and I have one younger brother that farms with me and a son. And then we got some full-time employees. David Hula: But the history here at Renwood Farms is unique in that, our ancestors came from Czechoslovakia. They landed in Baltimore. And everybody was going West, go West, go west. Now, this wasn't in the 1600s or 1700s. This was in the 1800s, late 1800s. And they went West. They went out to Kansas. They passed all that fertile ground from Baltimore to Kansas. And they just had a string of bad weather. And then my great-grandfather moved to Missouri and that's where my great-grandmother passed away from the Spanish flu. And then he took three kids and moved all the way to Texas. And then the drought followed him. And then he came back to Virginia. And that's where they were farming some ground. And then they bought some ground here on the banks of the James River. And it's kind of where we've resided ever since. David Hula: And we farm. When you think about it, you think of Jamestown, oh, you think of the James River, you think of Jamestown. And if you ever watch the Walt Disney movie called Pocahontas, you get the little bit of the story of Captain John Smith coming across the Atlantic Ocean and landed on the island. He came up the Chesapeake Bay, landed on Jamestown Island. And I'm like, that would be my luck. I'd float across the Atlantic ocean land on an island. Well, they did that on purpose because they didn't know what kind of enemies they were going to be combating. So just the safety net. And that was in 1607. And 1609 they left the island and started farming. David Hula: What's now called Mainland Farms. And it is the oldest continuously farm ground here in the US from the Western civilization. And we've been farming that. So it's been farmed every year since 1609. And it's the second place Jon, that we recorded 300-bushel dry land corn. So when you think about how good stewards we are. We've come from digging a hole, putting a catfish down and three or four kernels, a maize or corn seed on top of that catfish, that was a fertility program to producing 300-bushel corn. And that ground's been cultivated for 400 plus years. That's just unique in itself there. And it's just a great area to raise a family and I'm just ever grateful. We didn't chase and try to find gold, we were just trying to make a livelihood back then when they came back. Jon Doggett: You know, when people say corn production isn't sustainable. Well, the European settlers have been doing it since the early 1600s and the indigenous people did it for 100s of years before that. So I think we got it down and it's still around. So tell us a little bit about... I think you have some unique challenges or opportunities. I'm not sure which they are, farming near Jamestown. You have some folks that like to come and dig around on your property, don't you? David Hula: Well, you think about what's happened here in Virginia, you had the Indians and then you had the revolutionary war. Then we had the civil war and just all kinds of maybe some conflicts. And then of course we got the city folks or the urban sector there. And along the James River, you have the plantation houses. And some of those were where some civil war battlefield actually occurred. And in that, they have these civil war reenactments, or they may have some kind of gathering where a bunch of folks get together. So that just entices Relic Hunters. And we would get Relic Hunters come out and they may find a musket ball. They may find a belt buckle, just all kinds of stuff. So it got to be a point where, as time went on, some of these artifacts became of some value and some of these Relic Hunters would come by boat, come off the river shore, night vision goggles and stuff just to go out and Relic hunt because sometimes you'd give them permission and sometimes you wouldn't, because you might have a crop out there. David Hula: You don't want somebody branching through your corn field or your wheat field to look for some musket ball. So it annoyed me enough to where in a lime pile, I just went and got a bunch of old washers and nuts and threw it in the lime pile and broadcasted it across the field. So that deterred most of those Relic Hunters. And I hope I personally don't ever want to pick up Relic Hunting because I know what I'm going to find. Dusty Weis: So that's one way to do it. David, they came in with night vision goggles. I didn't realize that the Relic Hunters were that well equipped. David Hula: Well, you think about it. Some of that stuff that they can find can be worth several 1,000 dollars. So it can become lucrative to some but most folks that Relic Hunt. As long as they'd fill the hole back up, ask permission. We probably wouldn't have nearly the issue, but when they don't fill in the hole and they tramp through your field. So yeah, that becomes a problem. Dusty Weis: You know, my grandfather on my mother's side ran a tree farm in Northern Wisconsin pretty much his whole life until he passed away. And I used to go out with him, walking the fire breaks after we would plow them and we'd just have our heads down in the dirt, looking for Indian arrowheads. And for him, it was always such a cool reckoning back to the history of the land that he had the privilege to be a steward of. And I would imagine that, when you're going through, you're breaking soil, getting ready to plant in the spring, do you ever get a chance to just walk through those fields and see what you turn up? David Hula: Well, we used to, years ago. Now that we've transitioned in more to continuous no-till, we're not breaking that ground, the farm there at Mainland Farms right next to Jamestown. Since we've been farming in the early 1990s, we turned it into a continuous no-till, but somebody came out there with like a one or two bottom plow and they figured that this had to be a particular spot to find some Indian artifacts. So they plowed up a section without permission just went out there. And I'm sure they found some artifacts of some sort, but we go out there when we were doing some tillage, we'd find some stuff along the river shore. On a low tide, we can find some arrowheads. And, and then just looking at the edges of some of the fields. David Hula: We have one particular farm called Gospel Spreading Farm. It's got revolutionary forts as well as civil war forts, just in the edges of woods right there. So you think about all that and think about where we've come. I mean we're in the epicenter where all these battles where the country started and then freedom continued. So it is neat. Jon Doggett: That has to be a really interesting component to what you do. So let's talk about what we're going to talk about and the secrets to your success. How have you been able to do what you've been able to do, which is truly amazing. So tell us about how you got started in the contest and what you have done to be so successful. David Hula: Well, Jon, I guess it started back... I remember first of all, just riding on the fender. And that, nobody rides on a tractor fender planting anymore. Cause we got cabs and all that. But as a kid, I was riding on a tractor fender with my dad and he was planting corn. And I think that was a time in which I said, Hey, I want to farm. And you know, we would talk and I'd just see all that and see how detailed he was. So went to North Carolina state left there, came back to the farm, then left the farm for a little while and started working in the water quality industry for the Chesapeake Bay folks here in Virginia. Because when you think about, we got all this history, but we have ground zero for water quality. The Chesapeake Bay was probably the first watershed that they started cleaning up. And I've become a nutrient specialist and covered a large geographic area of Virginia and got to talk with a lot of great growers. David Hula: There's one in particular in Ronnie Russell. And he was a yield contest winner in the state for many years. And had the chance to learn from folks like him and other growers, came back to the farm, started implementing these things because good Lord. It gave me one mouth and two ears. So I was a sponge pitching ideas to my dad and granddad and they say, \"Yeah, that might work. Maybe it might not\". So as we would try things, I would just pick and choose. I started networking and creating this group of folks around myself. And from the fertilizer industry to the seed folks, John Deere equipment folks, Pioneer seed or nutrient, you just... All kinds of specialists and then entered the contests. And I think we came in third the first time and I thought that was a good feat. David Hula: And then we entered again and we came in first and got a chance to take a little trip somewhere. My wife and I, and then they sent us to... I think it was the first time they had the actual Commodity Classic. I think it was in Phoenix maybe. So we went out there and it's like, \"Hey, this is awesome\". So that was kind of the drive, Jon, Hey, we got to have a trip, all expense paid trip, little vacation. And then we started talking to growers, and that opened up the possibility like, Hey, we're in Virginia, but here's guys in the Midwest that are producing a 100 plus bushels more than we are. Why can't we do that? So we just started pushing it and then I don't remember what classic it was, but I was sitting on a bus. And the late Francis Childs got on the bus and he sat right across the aisle from me. And he called me by name and he introduced himself and he was like an idol to me. David Hula: He's like, Oh my goodness, here's Francis Childs, and we're talking and he said, \"David, get over your Eastern mentality of a corn ear. You don't need one big ear. You just need a lot of good medium size ears\". And just with that, it rejuvenated me to where we would try different things and wouldn't have that stereotype of, hey, this is the only way we can do it. So it opened up all these possibilities. David Hula: And having that ability to talk to growers there at the Classic and just network, gave us the drive to continue. And I know those that watch this podcast, everybody wants to know what is that one silver bullet that we do. And unfortunately, there is no silver bullet. I like to say there's three great things that produce high yield and corn. A good Lord, bless you. Number two, you got to have Pioneer seed. Number three, you got to have John Deere paint. So, with those that's easy. But it's a whole system, Jon, that takes it from the planter to in-season management to harvesting. I can talk hours about that, but we sure don't want to bore the audience with all the details, but I know they want to know some of the secrets and tricks of the trade. Jon Doggett: You know, one of the things I just heard it from you and I've heard it from other corn yield contest winners. And number one is you don't do it by yourself. You do it by talking to a lot of different people. And it's amazing to me how much information you guys share with one another. I keep hearing that over and over again. The other thing you said, was we keep trying new things, and you find yourself willing to make mistakes in order to find out what doesn't work in order to find out what does work. And that kind of mentality of working with others and being willing to change and trying new things, that can help you raise a lot of corn can also help you in the rest of your life. David Hula: So, I will say that, probably the one big difference between myself and a lot of other growers that either participating in the corn contest or just growers in general, I've failed more times than I've had success. I don't mind failing. It's just, you want to learn from your mistakes. It's clearly cheaper to learn from somebody else's mistakes than your own, but we do lots and lots of trials. It might be a small strip trial to where I've taken the corn planter, jacked up the closing row and hand-planted seed, just to see the differences of how the seed orientation is. I've taken two and a half-gallon jugs and side dressed corn. And we pull tissue samples and then we do trials. And we do plots and then things that we see, we start putting on maybe a bigger trial and then more acres. David Hula: So to get to where we are today has taken decades. I see Randy Dowdy, from Georgia first guy to break 500 bushels. And he'd sure don't mind letting me know that, but he came in from no farming background, but he only sourced out information from successful folks. So he just streamlined all that to where growers like myself, I'm in a routine. We have this preconceived notion. So it's hard to get out of that norm, but we have failed a huge amount, but we've learned from those failures, Dusty Weis: You know, David, I had the chance at Commodity this year to talk to a couple of different yield contest winners. And it made me chuckle a little bit, because the systems for keeping track of successes and failures, essentially keeping track of your data and learning from what works and what doesn't are so different. I talked to one person and she said, \"Oh yeah, I've got just spreadsheets on spreadsheets on spreadsheets. It's as complicated as the IRS over here”. And I talked another fellow and he said, \"Don't write anything down. It's all up here\". So what's your system for keeping track of the data there? David Hula: Well, unfortunately there's some data that we just lose because we forget about where we've done a trial, but the neat thing about the technologies that we have and the planters and then the sprayers and then the harvesting equipment. All that can get downloaded, not a big guy that likes to use the cloud. I'm not an expert on technologies, but if we can enter the information correctly, either in whatever implement we're driving, whether it's the planter, the strip till machine. David Hula: Because we like to use a soil warrior or the sprayer. And then when we go to harvesting, that's one way we track, but in all the equipment, we still have a notebook, because irregardless that technology could be there, but something could happen to where we lose that information. So we're writing things down, we split the planter up. So I might be making a pass like we're planting corn today and half the planter's got one hybrid, the other half's got another hybrid. We're also doing trials with different in-furrow and how it impacts each one of those hybrids. So we write down, but then we also use some of the current technologies available to us. Jon Doggett: So David let's step back just a little bit, because obviously we know what the corn yield contest is. And a lot of people do, but tell us about the corn yield contest is at a 100 acres, a 1,000 acres, half an acre. What do you do? How do you enter? All of those things. Walk us through some of that. David Hula: Well in fact, we've already planted two areas that we are anticipating to have be part of the National Corn Growers Association Yield Contest. So first of all, it's got to be a minimum of 10 acres continuously of one corn hybrid. And a lot of times if you've had success or you have a good relationship with your seed provider, they may either discount it or give you some seed to put into the plot. So that's one way to save some money, particularly in the cost area. I say, hey, I'm going to push some corn, how about throwing me a few bags of seed? And then we try to hedge our bets. We don't ever know if it's going to be a sunny year or a cloudy year. So we don't know what population to plant, but you got to have 10 acres of a continuous one hybrid. David Hula: And then when it comes time to send in the entry form, we go online. All this has been streamlined makes it so much easier. I remember it used to be to where you actually had to pick the field, pick the hybrid before you entered nowadays, all you have to do is pick the particular hybrid. So is giving you a little bit more flexibility, but if it's irrigated, it's going to be in that particular field. So we send in the entry form, they ask hybrid information, planting information, seeding information, some equipment information, some fertility, and then also just some basic agronomic information, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, and fertilizer. And then, after you've got that submitted, they send you a nice letter or email say, \"Hey, your entry's been submitted\". And then just prior to harvest, you have to also designate certain folks to be supervisors. David Hula: Because the neat thing about the national corn contest is that, there are folks that are either certified or have credentials to verify that that yield is actually occurring. And you know, with that in mind, to me it gives it comfort. And we've had great success. We've had a lot of folks from the National Corn Growers Association come in. Whether they come from the home office or they come from other states or DC, they come down and they observe it. But you have these supervisors that are out there watching you harvest. So the neat thing about the harvest is you go out there, you have to harvest at least one in a quarter acres. So out of that 10 acres or not a huge amount of it, but based on your header width, we just run an eight-row head. David Hula: So we'll pick eight rows in this plot. And then when we get to the end of the area that we're going to stop, they measure it. And if we have not harvested at least an acre and a quarter out of that, then we have to skip three header widths. So we're skipping 24 rows and then we harvest again and we keep doing that until we at least get an acre and a quarter to where we can put in the truck and then take to the certified scales and all the testing done. But the supervisors, they go in, they look in the back of the truck, make sure the truck's empty. They look in the grain tank, make sure the grain tank's empty. And I remember years ago, one of the fellas that came and supervised his name was Paul. Can't remember his last name, but he is like, \"Hey Dave, go ahead and swing the auger out and then turn the unload auger on.\" David Hula: And I looked at him, I was bewildere like, \"\"Okay, I'll do that\". I'm like why? As you just saw, he said, \"Well, just want to make sure everything's empty\". I'm like, \"Well, that's great\". So we turned to unload auger on. Maybe a handful of corn comes out of it. And nowadays what they do is they ask you, engage the harvesting equipment, turn the header on, turn the combine on, swing the unload auger out, run it, make sure there's no grain captured anywhere. That's just another form of checks and balance. And I clearly understand all this. And then after they do that, then you start harvesting. And then when you dump it into the truck, the supervisor, we have at least one supervisor riding with us. The neat thing about the equipment nowadays, Dusty, is there's a co-pilot seat on everything. David Hula: So got a supervisor riding, another supervisor's running a measure wheel that's been certified or checked where they lay a tape measure out. A 100-foot measuring tape. They calibrate the wheel, make sure it's all legit. And we do our acre and a quarter, dump it in the truck. Then the supervisory either rides in the truck or follows the truck, goes to the granary. Wherever we're getting it weighed. And then they collect samples, run it through their certified moisture samples and truck gets dumped, unloaded. They have a piece of paper and fortunately, Jon, we have to do it all over again. So have to do that recheck. Jon Doggett: I would be reminisce if I didn't acknowledge that Linda Lambur is on with us. And she runs this program for NCGA and she's out of our St. Louis office. And the details that the entrants have to follow, she's the one has to make sure that that winner is announced, that that's the winner and she does a super job for us. And so it's really great to get her perspective, talking about all the different people that she works with from Virginia clear out to California. And it's really pretty neat, but that's a lot of detail. I had not thought about, oh yeah, you got to run the auger for at least a few seconds to go ahead and make sure that is not...There could be certain amount of corn in there. That's pretty neat. Dusty Weis: Yeah, Jon, we joked earlier about being as thorough as the IRS here. And when it comes to the National Corn Yield Contest, you got to make sure that you're as thorough as the IRS there. It is worth noting here that as of Monday, May 2nd, the contest will be open for 2022 entries. Anyone who's interested in that can go to ncga.com and click on the Get Involved tab up at the top of the website there. And the National Corn Yield Contest is right on top there. So anybody who's hearing about that. Now's the time to start thinking about getting involved in the 2022 contest. Jon Doggett: David, one question, what's your goal for this year? What's your goal for the contest into the future? You must have some goals, don't you? David Hula: Well, first of all, yes, we do have goals. And to see four, five, now 600 bushel. That's all a success. I don't care what grower it is. I got some ground. If I just see 200-bushel, I get excited about, but for high yield stuff, again, just to see 600-bushel, I think is an accomplishment, because right now there's only one farming operation that has reported it. Now I'm not naive to think other growers have not seen it, but to have it recorded and documented. Based on what I share with growers, when you're out harvesting a field and you see your yield monitor get to a level, the first thing you should do is stop the combine, get out and look and see what's different about that corn versus the rest of your field. Hey, I even got a soil sample probe in our combine. David Hula: I'm going to pull a soil sample. What was special about that fertility and that soil that might have done it? But then if you see a yield that your monitor gets to and just like everybody else, I got a cell phone. I can play with the joystick, take a picture of a high yield, send it to my buddy, say look what we're picking. But if you see a yield that's kind of high and it stays there for a little while, that should be your new target. And we've seen levels into the upper 600s. I've seen the monitor jump to 700. Now I think that was partially because a lot of corn was on the header and it all went in. So that yield is attainable and somebody will get to it at one point in time. Jon Doggett: David you're on the James River, you're close to the Chesapeake Bay, everything that flows off your farm flows into the bay. I paddle a kayak a lot. And the bay is important. It's a really big thing out here on the east coast. And there's a lot of people that will point to people like you and say, \"Oh, you just dumping all that fertilizer on that corn\". And just so you can win a contest and what are you doing with the rest of your ground? So what do you say to those folks? And what do you say to folks that are saying, \"You're just in it for one or two years\". I think you've proven that you have a bit of a longer view, but talk about your sustainability, not only your environmental sustainability, but your family sustainability, your community sustainability. When you farm right on one of the most important watersheds in the country. David Hula: Well, it's important to me because I remember as a kid, I’m just under sixty years old now, and when myself and my two younger brothers were annoying, my mom, she'd just say, \"Y'all go outside, go swim in the river\". Well the river was polluted back then. And over time it has really cleaned up. We, as producers have done a tremendous job in the '80s or ‘70s we started transition to a little bit of no-till. In the fall of 1986 my dad started a project to where we were going to take one field and continuously no-till it? This particular field is three miles to the east of us down a dirt road. And it was far enough away, that if we committed to it, we didn't have to look at it every day. But if it worked, we were going to start implementing it on more acres. And from that time on that field has not been tilled since the fall of '86 and we continuously pull good crops off it. David Hula: So we're being good stewards from erosion control. And then now with technologies that we have, with the planters, the technologies ability to put fertilizer on one or two sides of the corn row, below the soil surface, fertilizer in with the seed. And then we also have started implementing what we call strip-tilling. We're using a soil warrior to where we're working up a small piece of dirt, 4, 5, 6 inches wide, putting some fertilizer down there, we've controlled some erosion because we have all the rest of the area that is in what we call no-till or we have the cover. We're just working up that seed zone. And we've allowing to put our fertilizer there. Then we are even more efficient to where we're making multiple applications of nitrogen. We have equipment to put fertilizer right beside the corn row. We do that at specific times in the season. David Hula: And then in their irrigation environments, we use irrigation as a tool we'll fertigate. And we look at what our yield goal is, we understand what nutrient requirements we have for that, and then we just make applications accordingly. So when we think about sustainability, I need to protect my soil. I don't want to pollute the environment. And I want to have something to pass on to my son and for him to continue on because I'm the third generation here. And a fourth generation here in Virginia. But the third on this farm, I got my son, Craig is a fourth. I got a grandson. David Hula: Hopefully he may want a farm one day. So the only way we can do that is protect our soil, protect our environment and we have to make it profitable. So all these things work hand in hand, because the neatest thing when you think about this term sustainable, and sometimes I feel like it might be overused, but environmentalists as well as good agronomic practices that we as producers, they go hand in hand and they are usually very economical. So we focus on return on investment. I like to think that all the things that we do, that we are not only producing high yield, but we're also protecting the environment. And no, we do not just dump fertilizer on a piece of field just to try to get a high yield, that doesn't work. Jon Doggett: The price of fertilizer being what it is right now, is probably your highest non land cost. That fertilizer doesn't do you any good out in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay, you want to keep it on the farm? So that's one of the things I keep reminding people in the environmental community, is we don't overuse fertilizer just to have it go down the streams. David Hula: One funny thing I like to say is when you look at the Chesapeake Bay, when you look at the map and you look at where the James river is, where the last tributary feeding into the Chesapeake Bay, before it dumps into the Atlantic ocean. And then I oftentimes point to the Northern part. Up there where the Potomac is. And that's where DC is. And I like to share with folks and say, you do know what flows downhill, right? So we're recycling, whatever nutrients that may be flowing down the river. Jon Doggett: I've paddled a lot of the Potomac and a lot of the Chesapeake bay area. And I can tell you, going by a farm, the water is a lot different than going by a subdivision and certainly The Great Plains area up north of you up the Potomac, it’ a different deal, but really interesting to talk about sustainability and at the same time, talk about sustainability with these yields that are just so incredibly amazing. And 10 years ago 600 bushels was really out of sight. What do you think it's going to be another 10 years, David got any projections? David Hula: Well, I remember, the late Francis Childs, he was 400 and some bushels, and then Randy Dowdy went to 500, and Steve Albrecht, the late Steve Albrecht from Hart, Texas, he was up into that 400 bushel range as well. I'm not great on a computer, but I do like Google and you type in what is the theoretical potential yield of corn. And at some point in time, they said years ago it was 500 bushels. Well, I found a Professor Tollenaar said that by some 2030 or 40, the theoretical yield of corn could be somewhere in that 1,311 bushels. David Hula: I'm like where in the world did you get 1,311? So I figured that'd be a great Pioneer hybrid one day 1311QZRT, whatever acronym behind it. But we're clearly over 500, we're over 600. We're not at 1300. So I feel the yield of corn is somewhere in that 8, 900 bushel range and, Dusty, if their theoretical yield is 8 or 900 bushels and our country averages only 170 some bushels, We ass growers are not doing a very good job. So there's a big gap, but I think as time goes on, we're going to start seeing their yields increase. Because farmers in general are just great innovators and they're going to continue to push the envelope. Dusty Weis: Well, and a lot of that pressure falls on your son too. Jon Doggett: And I'll bet somebody by the name of Hula will be involved in some of those great future successes. So thank you, David, for sharing your story about how you are so productive on your corn farm, and what it looks like in a part of the country where people don't naturally assume that you're raising corn. So that's really pretty neat. I want to close by thanking the contest premier sponsors BASF, Corteva and John Deere, and the 18 seed companies that cover membership and entry fees for the contest, and our outstanding network of yield supervisors who keep the contest going year after year.

Ag stakeholders appreciate how neonicotinoid seed treatments and other products increase yields and boost revenues, but they are also committed to protecting bees and other wildlife. This spring, growers and applicators can follow a few simple guidelines to BeSure! they’re using pesticides safely. For Growers: Follow directions on the label for appropriate storage, use and disposal practices. When planting treated seed, use advanced seed flow lubricants that minimize dust. Additionally, when planting treated seed, eliminate flowering plants and weeds in the field prior to planting. For foliar applications, ensure that sprays are directed away from any flowering plants, follow established buffer zones and calibrate equipment to minimize spray drift. Before making an application, be aware of any honeybees and hives near the field and communicate with neighboring beekeepers prior to treatment. Remove and properly dispose of all treated seed. Keep all treated seed out of commodity grain channels. For Applicators: Comply with all regulations when using registered pesticide products and ensure proper employee training prior to application. Apply best management practices when using treated seed or foliar sprays to minimize dust or spray drift. Establish written protocols using best practices to ensure high-quality seed treatment, foliar or field application. Adopt stewardship documentation for the full life cycle of seed treatment products. Properly discard any unused product, rinse water or seed treatment by following the label disposal instructions to minimize any potential environmental impact. Ensure that all required and pertinent neonicotinoid treatment information, consistent with the product label, is conveyed to customers.

    "title": "NCGA Thanks EPA for Following Through on President Bidens E15 Emergency Waiver",
    "content": "The following is a statement from NCGA President Chris Edgington on today’s announcement from the EPA issuing an emergency fuel waiver for E15 sales. “We thank EPA Administrator Michael Regan for following through on the president’s recent announcement in Iowa and taking the action needed to ensure drivers maintain access to lower-cost, lower-emissions E15,” said NCGA president Chris Edgington. “We also agree with EPA’s assessment that treating E15 the same as regular fuel in the market maintains air quality. By acting today, and commitment to act through the summer, the Biden Administration will help increase the fuel supply by relying on more domestic biofuels and reducing our dependence on oil.” Environmental Benefits of E15: E15 has a lower RVP than E10 and, therefore, results in lower evaporative emissions, the goal of RVP regulation. Blending more ethanol to make E15 displaces and dilutes the most toxic aromatic hydrocarbon components in gasoline, reducing exhaust emissions for cleaner air. Ethanol results in 44 to 52 percent fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than gasoline. Higher ethanol blends like E15 result in fewer GHG emissions. Earlier this month, corn farmers applauded President Biden for using existing authority to give consumers more options at the pump that are lower-cost and environmentally friendly. Ethanol has been priced an average of 80 cents less per gallon than unblended gasoline at wholesale through March, and drivers currently save up to 20 cents or more per gallon with E15.",

Michigan Corn Growers Association board member Allyson Maxwell testified at the hearing titled “Growing Jobs and Economic Opportunity: 2023 Farm Bill Perspectives from Michigan,” outlining many of the priorities that are important for corn farmers across the U.S. “The safety net provided by crop insurance is vital to maintaining the agriculture industry in this country, especially in the face of increasingly unpredictable disasters like droughts, floods and extreme weather,” Maxwell said. Maxwell went on to talk about the importance of assistance for new/beginning farmers, bolstering U.S. international market development efforts through the Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development (FMD) program, and the role conservation and sustainable farming practices play in her operation. “As Congress discusses reauthorizing the farm bill, I hope that the issues facing farmers today will remain top of mind,” added Maxwell. “A successful farm bill reauthorization should continue critical loan programs for new and existing farmers, while bringing them in line with the economic realities facing farmers today.” NCGA and state corn grower associations will continue to be engaged in the farm bill process and work to advance the issues important to America’s corn farmers.",

    "content": "A segment of the panel will be featured on the U.S. Farm Report on Saturday, April 16 at 9 a.m. CT. The Success in Stewardship Network (SISN), an initiative of NCGA and the Environmental Defense Fund, breaks down the notion that only elite groups can improve environmental results. Conservation practices that protect the land and water are not only accessible, profitable, scalable—they are commonplace on farms across America. Recipients of 2022’s SISN recognition, the Iowa Seed Corn Cover Crop Initiative and INField Advantage, were honored at a panel presentation that was hosted by U.S. Farm Report’s Tyne Morgan. The event, which was held in National Corn Growers Association’s “Born for the Field” booth, focused on the U.S. Corn Sustainability 2030 Goals and how growers are taking the lead in writing and sharing their personal sustainability stories. The panel kicked off with NCGA Board Member and Field to Market Chair Brandon Hunnicutt drawing the important connections between the boots-on-the-ground efforts, NCGA’s nationwide sustainability goals, and amplifying each grower’s conservation journey: “NCGA put out the Corn Sustainability Report last summer and we have some very solid goals we are going after by 2030 to help really reduce our environmental footprint,” said Nebraska grower Brandon Hunnicutt. “It’s really important from my standpoint to be able to measure those successes—more than just saying ‘hey, we’re doing it’—to that point that we can really go out and show what we’re doing as an American corn farmer . . . and then how can we partner with others to make sure those initiatives are being met.” Since 2020, the Success in Stewardship Network has acknowledged state and regional programs for their excellence in stewardship, including clear goal-setting and thorough data collection. This year’s recognition included the following representatives: Shannon Moeller, Iowa Seed Corn Cover Crop Initiative project coordinator; Bert Strayer, Iowa Seed Association board member; and INField Advantage grower directors Mike Buis and David Ring. The Iowa Seed Corn Cover Crop Initiative focuses on ways to help increase the adoption of cover crops, specifically within the seed corn production system in Iowa. The focus on seed corn is driven by the unique opportunity that seed corn provides, due to the earlier harvest, thereby providing better timing opportunities for establishing cover crops in the late summer and fall after harvest. This focus is also heavily driven by the seed corn industry in Iowa, and their efforts to help promote and support the use of cover crops as part of Iowa’s Nutrient Strategy. INfield Advantage has been providing trial-based management practice evaluations to Indiana growers since 2011. Through the program’s agronomic partners, farmers have access to the highest quality assessment technology and expertise — allowing them to leverage real, personalized, on-farm data to understand how field-specific practices can influence input use, soil health and ultimately yields or input cost savings.

This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. From the fields of corn belt to the DC beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: I'm Dusty Weis, and you want to talk about key leaders? At Commodity Classic a few weeks back, NCGA CEO, Jon Doggett, and I were on a panel with executives from the four other presenting organizations who organized that trade show: the American Soybean Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Sorghum Producers, and the Association of Equipment manufacturers. Together, we discussed policy, supply chain, sustainability biofuels, and just about every other issue facing the ag industry today. There was so much expertise and so much info in that discussion, in this episode, we're going to play it for you in its entirety. Dusty Weis: But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also make sure you follow the NCGA on Twitter @nationalcorn and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. Dusty Weis: 150 years of experience at the very highest levels of the agriculture industry was on display at the Commodity Classic Executives Round Table. Panel members included Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association, Steve Censky, CEO of the American Soybean Association, Chandler Goule, the CEO of the National Association of Wheat Growers, Tim Lust, the CEO of the National Sorghum Producers, and Curt Blades, Senior President of Ag at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers. Dusty Weis: I was called on to moderate the panel, and in a year that's seen no shortage of ag news, we had lots to discuss. Dusty Weis: Of course, not too long ago, the US-China trade war was the most stressful thing that we had to deal with in geopolitics. It was headline news a whole lot and now, shipments to China have recently been strong. Tariffs are still a looming concern, and tariffs were only symptomatic of other concerns with China. Dusty Weis: So starting with Mr. Steven Censky from the Soybean Association, what do farmers want to see from the current administration on China relations? Steve Censky: I think farmers want to see, and this is what we want to see from the American Soybean Association, is that we need to, even as the administration manages the very tough issues that we have with China, whether that's Hong Kong or Taiwan or the Uighurs, we need to also make sure that we keep our exports flowing. We want to keep a commercial trading relationship going, even as we engage to try to address those other very large, massive geopolitical issues because China needs our soybeans. We want to supply soybeans. They're the biggest soybean market in the world. They import more soybeans than the rest of the world combined. So if you take out China, you can't just go someplace else and export those soybeans. Even though we are diversifying our markets, just that China is so huge, we want to keep that trading relationship going. Dusty Weis: Chandler Goule, you've got something that you want to add from the wheat growers? Chandler Goule: I do. So I want to echo a lot of the comments that Steve said on maintaining that important market in one of the largest economies in the world, but there's several other things that are going specific to wheat as it relates to trade with China. Chandler Goule: First, I want to go all the way back to the WTO case that US wheat growers and rice growers won against China for their domestic support and also, for not fulfilling the World Trade Organization fulfillment for how much wheat and rice they were to be buying from the United States. China is still out of compliance with that WTO ruling that they did not appeal and then here, just recently, with the Russian-Ukraine conflict and invasion, which I'm sure we'll discuss a little later, they have lifted all of their restrictions on Russian wheat coming into China when they're still not even in compliance with the WTO case that we've won. Chandler Goule: We are very happy to see the progress that the last administration, the current administration made on phase one, but we're still lacking about 20% of fulfilling that full agreement. So though it's a very important market to us, we still have a lot of outstanding issues that need to be solved with China. Dusty Weis: Outside of China, I want to talk about some of the challenges and some of the opportunities that your members and your markets are facing. And so starting with Mr. Jon Doggett from the National Corn Growers Association, Jon, what are some of the challenges that are facing your industry, and are there some particular market challenges or areas for growth in the future, would you say? Jon Doggett: Boy, you want to talk about markets, look at what has happened in the markets. I mean, I don't care what the commodity is, whether it's gold or corn or wheat or oil, I mean, everything's exploded in the last few months. That's a lot to figure out, where we're going to be with these markets and is this just a series of flips or is this going to be the way we're going to be moving forward? Jon Doggett: The biggest issue I hear from farmers when they start talking and I hear that, \"Do you know how much I paid for...\" it's a good idea to hold the phone as far away from my ear as I can because I'm going to hear about fertilizer prices. And we are very concerned about the fertilizer market, about how fertilizers imported into this country and about the companies that produce and sell it, and we are working hard to address that, and I think that one of the things we're going to find out is our farmers are going to be real innovative about how to use less nitrogen. Dusty Weis: Yeah, certainly, certainly, and that'll factor as well into some of the sustainability topics that we're going to talk about a little bit further down here as well. Dusty Weis: But I did want to serve that same question up to Tim Lust, the CEO of the National Sorghum Producers, Mr. Lust, when you look at the challenges facing your industry, what are the challenges? What are the opportunities that you see there for sorghum growers? Tim Lust: So, I think, obviously, I would just echo from a China standpoint what Steve Censky said from sorghum, just down the line, one comment after another that he made, including that they buy more than all of our other consumers put together. Tim Lust: I think the opportunity side of that when we talk about trade is is as we look to India, tremendous opportunities. Now, if you look around up here, this group's been around a while. And so I say that, but I realized that first started working on getting access to India, I believe in 1999 from our sorghum industry standpoint and so understand that that is a marathon process and there's been a lot of challenges there. Tim Lust: But when we really look at opportunities in the next very large market that we think sorghum would be a great fit for, that's certainly one that's very high on our priority list. Dusty Weis: Another challenge that we hear echoed from a lot of producers, of course, is supply chain, and this is one that's very big in the headlines. It's hard to miss. And in fact, I'm sure you hear it from your growers as well, just because it's hard to get stuff. My wife and I just waited seven months to get a new truck. From the day we walked down to the lot and said, \"This is the one that we want\" until the day that that truck was in our possession, seven months. Dusty Weis: So coming to you, Curt Blades, from the Association of Equipment Manufacturers because this is a big thing for OEMs, especially, supply chain, top of mind, how have problems from port bottlenecks to pandemic restrictions stifled your members, and are you seeing any progress yet to returning to business as usual? Curt Blades: Well, thanks for the question and, of course, there are supply chain challenges, and every one of us has experienced it, and obviously, all of your members have experienced it as individuals. But I want to rephrase your question just a little bit because certainly, we have supply chain challenges that were brought about because of the pandemic, but you actually have to go back a little bit further to the beginning of these supply chain challenges, which started kind of back to China with the retaliatory tariffs around steel, and closely related to that would be the transportation issues that were closely tied to that as well. Curt Blades: So the supply chain challenges are very real. You hear about microchips, you hear about steel, you hear about containers being in the wrong position. Those are very real, and there's not a good solution for them. It's just when we're in a global market and something was shut down, it just takes a while to work our way through this. Curt Blades: The one thing that I've been very, very proud in representing the Association of Equipment Manufacturers is that we recognize the importance of the seasonality of the markets that we serve. And so our members very early on in this disruption, first of all, were recognized as an essential industry, so that helped to minimize some of the disruption by keeping the factories open here in the United States, but we're still in a global market. So some of those... been some transportation issues along the way, but our manufacturers and their dealers have been prioritizing [inaudible 00:09:01] parts to make sure that we can meet those important planting and harvesting deadlines. So that's, for the most part, that has been able to have the crops go in or come out in appropriate manner and then asking everyone to be a little bit more patient when asking for delivery. Curt Blades: Now, a positive outcome of this supply chain disruption is we're finding farmers planning ahead a whole lot more on their capital purchases than they ever had. And we always know that professional farmers don't buy a combine on a whim, but planning to head for that purchase one year, two years, three years in advance and working closely with their dealer and manufacturer to align up their capital equipment, that's a really good thing because that's just good, sound business, and I think that's going to be with us for a while. Curt Blades: But to the quickest answer of the point of your question, when are we going to see the resolution? I've been saying that it's just right around owner for about two years now, and I'm not sure that I'm comfortable saying that anymore because there's no real end in sight because it's one thing after another that's leading to the supply chain disruptions. Dusty Weis: Did anybody else at the table have anything they wanted to add to Curt's thoughts? Dusty Weis: Mr. Goule, please go ahead. Chandler Goule: Well, this extends even beyond equipment issues, as I know a lot of my growers continue to talk to me about, but it's also crop protection tools and glyphosate and even the delivery of fertilizer, if you can afford it. And so, I mean, this is a compounded problem that goes through our entire production practice on the farm from equipment to crop protection tools and so on. I know I don't represent specialty crops, but then you got labor and immigration and other issues out there that continue to add to our increased cost to production. Curt Blades: And I was just going to add to what Chandler said on the crop protection products, that's one of the things that we've been very much concerned about as the administration makes decisions, as the EPA makes decisions on crop protection tools that farmers rely on, our message to them is, \"Don't be making decisions to take the tools away when we already have herbicide cost and availability quite high, availability, quite low,\" and we can't be taking those tools away from farmers because that will just add to the supply chain issues. Curt Blades: Same thing on the fertilizer side. You all know that we've seen phosphate and potash prices double. We've seen nitrogen prices triple. And that's why we, along with the other organizations here too, have opposed the tariffs that have been placed on phosphates from Morocco. We're opposed to placing tariffs on UAN nitrogen imports from Trinidad and Tobago. It just does not make any sense, and the economic circumstances just don't warrant that. Dusty Weis: Mr. Jon Doggett, this is something that actually came up on your podcast recently. I'm a regular listener, by the way, and that fertilizer and input prices have been through the roof, and certainly, we've seen corn prices rising too, but we talked to the president of your association a couple weeks back and he said, \"Now, we're not getting to keep any of that extra money that we're bringing in through high corn prices because our inputs are up so much.\" Dusty Weis: What would you say is your member's general state of concern, and what do they want to see happen to address these? Jon Doggett: A couple of us were talking the other night. You can imagine what the nightmare would be if corn had a three in front of it instead of a seven and you had these input costs where they're at. Boy, it'd be a whole different world today, but it's not comfortable. The solution to high corn prices is high corn prices. The solution to low corn prices is low corn prices. Jon Doggett: But this fertilizer thing, some of this really bears some investigation of what's really going on with some of this? We know that there are issues with supply chain, but let's not make it worse. And right now, when the world is going to need more corn, because we don't know what's going to happen in Ukraine, but when we need more wheat, when we don't know what's going to happen in Ukraine. This unsettledness and this uncertainty around the major inputs like fertilizer and glyphosate, that's a huge, huge issue. And most of them are saying, \"We're good for this year, but boy, next year it could be a whole different game\" and just probably at the moment that the world's going to need us to maximize our production. Dusty Weis: Tim Lust from the National Sorghum Producers, what are you hearing from your growers? Tim Lust: Well, on one hand, I think the good news is is for most of us, a lot of our seed production is domestic, and we're in good shape. You got to get the seed in the ground and obviously, that's a discussion around the world, but I think that's a great first step. Tim Lust: Commend the other leaders up here and what all of our organizations are doing to address the issues related to fertilizer and chemicals because I think you have a perfect storm here that is showing a lot of weaknesses in our supply chain, but frankly, some strategic weaknesses for the United States in how we develop and deliver crop improvement tools to our growers, and so I don't think this topic is going to go away after what we're seeing right now, and I think what Jon said about more light getting shined there is something that we will see. Tim Lust: I think from our crop standpoint, certainly, maybe not as many inputs as others, but still, even transportation that was talked about, I mean, we certainly have supply challenges, but just the transportation. We have a real trucking shortage, even if we get it to the United States to get it to delivered where it needs to be in the country on time. So this is a multifaceted problem, as has been mentioned earlier, one we will have to work through. I'm confident we will. US growers have proven, as Jon said earlier, they'll find a way. We will find a way, but there's going be some firsts over the next couple of years, I'm afraid. Dusty Weis: Well, and Mr Lust, you mentioned transportation and lest we be accused of being all doom and gloom up on this panel here, we do have some good news to talk about in the transportation and infrastructure area.The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 will benefit American agriculture and rural communities in a number of ways because at the end of the day, the transportation of goods, either for domestic consumption or for export markets, is critical to all of agriculture. Dusty Weis: So I'd like to start with Curt Blades from the Association of Equipment Manufacturers on this one because I know that your group has been particularly active in pursuing this piece of legislation, but you all have as well. But Curt, how are we feeling about that right now? What benefits are we going to see as a result of this legislation? Curt Blades: Thanks for the question, and as many of you all may know, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers was right in front, if not the lead, on the infrastructure package and a lot of the original language, or certainly some of the things were included in that comprehensive infrastructure package, came from a project that actually AEM initiated 10 years ago called Infrastructure Vision 2050. And it was all designed to say, \"How do we build the right infrastructure for the future,\" and it was a panel of association members, a lot of them on the ag side, specifically addressing where our concerns are going to be, talking about the infrastructure for the commodities and for the supplies, but also, for being able to have the infrastructure in place in rural America to support the factories. Curt Blades: So that's been a really good thing. I mean, we can debate all day long whether there some things in there you don't like. I think we can all find things in the infrastructure package that we don't like, but we can all find a whole lot of things in there that we like, and what we're particularly happy about in there are the goodies for rural America because knowing that rural America was specifically called out for support of roads and bridges, obviously, very important stuff. But boy, the attention on rural broadband is fantastic. Curt Blades: There's some really cool equipment on the trade show floor downstairs, and it has the opportunity to do some really great things to help farmers' bottom lines and also, to improve the sustainability message. But you can't exercise the full potential of that equipment if you don't have always on reliable wireless internet connectivity in the field. And so the amount of attention that was given to rural America and specifically, around rural broadband is something we should all feel really good about, and we should all celebrate as a victory. That's a good thing for us. And I think when we have this conversation 5, 10 years from now, who knows what the machines are going to look like, and who knows what the good stories are going to come out of it, but it's going to be very exciting, largely because of the infrastructure package that was passed recently. Dusty Weis: Yeah, I wanted to get a grower perspective as well, so Chandler Goule from the National Association of Wheat Growers, what are your members looking forward to about this piece of legislation? Chandler Goule: Curt covered almost all of them, really, and the broadband was really what I was going to lean into, especially as we're doing more online ARC and PLC sign-up and your Conservation Title Program signing up and having that accessibility further away from your county FSA office. Chandler Goule: But I wanted to go back to a comment that Curt made on sustainability and transportation. Where my hotel is here in New Orleans, I've got a great view of the Mississippi River, and the amount of barging and commodities and goods and the size of these ships that are going by my hotel are crazy how important that river transportation system is, and we've got a major concern out on the Snake River in the Pacific Northwest, where there is a proposal to remove the four lower dams of the Snake River, which would make it completely unpassable for barging, which we know is the cheapest and the cleanest way to move goods. Chandler Goule: 60% of the wheat in the Pacific Northwest, including Montana, go through that river system. 10% of all wheat goes out that system. And if this proposal moves forward, then what about the locks and dams on the Mississippi? What about the locks and dams on other major transportation systems? So we support the infrastructure bill, but we've got to keep this clean energy transportation system in place. Dusty Weis: Jon Doggett from the National Corn Growers Association, I'd say this sounds like a great topic for a podcast episode. Jon Doggett: Well, if I can find a producer, maybe we could do that. It's interesting, we've worked on locks and dams and particularly with the soybean folks, but all of us have worked on locks and dams for a long time and that is so important, and we're glad to see that we're finally getting some dollars going in that direction. It's absolutely vital. Jon Doggett: But in addition, I hear from farmers is, \"It's great we're going to have locks and dams. That's wonderful, but you know what? It's five miles from my farm to the elevator. That bridge between here and there won't handle a full load. It won't even handle a half load, so I need to go around 10, 12, 15 miles, a detour.\" That's bottom line, and we have diesel fuel prices are as high as they are. That gets to be a concern. Jon Doggett: The rural infrastructure with bridges and roads is something that really needs to be addressed, and it needs to be addressed right away, and I think we're going to have an opportunity to do just that. Dusty Weis: Yeah, certainly. Dusty Weis: We're going to pick on another topic that I know is near and dear to your heart. To at least two of you on this panel here, I know the Renewable Fuel Standard is a very big deal. Corn and soy have rallied behind blending requirements and other policy that bolsters the RFS, and biofuels seem to be increasingly promising and increasingly expanding with renewable fuels and sustainable aviation fuel both buzz topics right now. Dusty Weis: So starting with Mr. Steven Censky from the American Soybean Association, how do you see these new biofuel markets helping your growers? Steve Censky: Well, if there's ever a time that we should be underscoring the need for investing and expanding our renewable fuel supply, now's the time. We need to expand our renewable fuels that we have here in the United States. We can grow it. We don't have to depend on foreign sources. We don't need to depend on Russia or other countries there, and it really is a time that we can try to do that. Steve Censky: I think the second part of our message that we give not only about that increasing the pool of supply for energy is the environmental one. And we know that the fuels of renewable diesel, biodiesel, it cuts greenhouse gas emissions by 60% compared to petroleum diesel, and so it can help the administration achieve the climate goals as well that it has. And so renewable fuels, I think, are a win-win. We can grow them here, and they're good not only for our economy, but they're good for America, for the rural economy as well as all of America. Dusty Weis: Jon Doggett from the National Corn Growers Association, I know you've spent a lot of time on Capitol Hill, probably more than is your preference, but that's the nature of the job. Dusty Weis: Why is it so important for the RFS to get support in DC, and what needs to happened to build that support? Jon Doggett: I think one of our growers this morning in our corn Congress session put it really, really well, and I think it encapsulates a really good point. President Biden doesn't need to call Venezuela or Saudi Arabia to get more oil. The folks that flew those planes into the World Trade Center were not from Minnesota. They were from Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia's funded a lot of really bad things. Why do we want to go to them to get our energy needs when we have energy that's available here that's renewable and is good for the environment? I think that, as he said, and very eloquently this morning is, \"President Biden, call us. We're ready to deliver. It's time.\" Dusty Weis: We want to drill down a little bit more on the RFS here, because I understand that Mr Censky, bakers and others in food service have been pretty vocal that they feel that the RFS is leading to soy oil shortages for their needs in the bakery. You would know better than most, Mr. Censky, how accurate is that assertion, and is there really a soy oil crisis? Steve Censky: There's not a soy oil crisis and really, some of the claims that have made are far exaggerated and just not true. If you take a look at the supply and demand situation, we just harvested, this last fall, a record soybean crop, and from that record soybean crop, we have a record amount of oil that's being processed here in the United States and is available and the yield of that oil is available. And you see that in the supply demand in use numbers that USDA has released as well, that our actually food use of soybean oil is going up. Steve Censky: Our biofuel use of soybean oil has actually gone down compared to the previous year, and that's because as we've been ramping up on renewable diesel, which is... there's been a lot of excitement about renewable diesel and what that potential is, and there's been a lot of plans announced, but we haven't seen the big ramp up there. Steve Censky: Some of the biodiesel production has gone down. So you take a look at that, an actual use of soybean oil for biofuels has gone down. USDA, in the [inaudible 00:23:06] that was just came out on Wednesday, they decreased biofuel use by 300 million pounds, increased domestic food use and increased exports for soybean oil. Steve Censky: So the truth of the matter is that we don't have a crisis, and we need to send the right signals as well. It would be the absolute wrong thing to do to do anything to mess with the RFS because we've seen a lot. We want our soybean farmers to plant a record crop. There's been a 20% expansion in crush plants. There's been a lot of crush plants across the United States that have been announced, and that means we're going to be processing more of those soybeans here in the United States, making the meal available for livestock and the oil for both food and biofuel use. That's a good thing. Dusty Weis: Well, as long as we're myth-busting here, I've got one more for you. Jon Doggett from the National Corn Growers Association, corn ethanol has taken a little bit of heat recently. What are the recent study that claims that RFS is a larger contributor to global warming than traditional gasoline? Jon Doggett: Yeah, well, there's been a lot of studies about ethanol over the years. We started off many years ago and some of you, I think, are around long enough to remember the [inaudible 00:24:17] study, which was around 30 years, and we had a push back on that for about 15 years. We've had dozens and dozens and dozens of studies talking about the efficiency and the efficacy of ethanol. And it's just odd that that study would come out a couple days before the Senate Energy Committee's going to have a hearing on biofuels. I don't believe in coincidences anymore. I think that's part of it. I would not be surprised to see that, maybe, there was funding from some nefarious source on some of this, but also, look at the deal with the bakers. So they're going to have put another penny or two worth of oil in their muffin? I mean, I think they protest too much. Jon Doggett: Again, the cure for high corn prices or high soybean prices is high corn or soybean prices. Our folks will produce to it, but they're not going to produce when they're getting whipsawed back and forth over these ridiculous claims. Dusty Weis: Chandler Goule from National Association of Wheat Growers. Corn and soy can't have all the fun here with [crosstalk 00:25:14]. Chandler Goule: Well, I mean, as the food grain that's sitting up here, I could tell you, I immediately started getting emails and phone calls from our wheat growers when the bakers came out against the RFS and renewable fuels, and I think there's just a major disconnect, not only through the research and studies that both corn and soy have done in this area, but how do the bakers think that they're going to meet the greenhouse gas and sustainability goals of the major food companies if they're going to come out against the greenest and most efficient type of renewable energy, so I think there's a misstep there in their calculation of coming out against the RFS. Chandler Goule: I mean, I called the bakers directly and said, \"Not only are you upsetting my growers, but I think you're really heading down the wrong direction here,\" and I'm more surprised at the General Mills' and the Kelloggs didn't turn around to the bakers and say the same thing. So I think there's a major education component there that we need to do that part of the supply chain. Dusty Weis: We've got a really easy topic coming up next and that's crop protection, so buckle your seat belts, and we're going to start with Mr. Tim Lust from Sorghum Producers. The organizations represented on this stage cover a wide national swath with very diverse needs from their farmer members. That certainly includes crop protection tools. So Mr. Lust, what is your organization doing to assure that the pesticides needed remain available? Tim Lust: We're involved on the regulatory side daily in terms of working with EPA. When you look at product near and dear to our growers, atrazine, a major market share for our industry, certainly significant for corn, a product with over 8,000 studies, 50 years' worth of use, data record unlike any other and yet, we're going through... I remember testifying at a scientific advisory panel a few years back, and what I started with was two pictures. One was with my oldest son as a baby on the first time I had testified on an SAP on this product and the second one with him getting married, right before I was testifying on my second scientific advisory panel on the issue. Tim Lust: In this time of severe supply chain issues and dependence upon crop protection products and challenges around the world, we're right back having serious discussions with EPA about a tool that has proven over and over to be effective and safe. And it's challenging, it's frustrating, but it is so important for our growers because when we look at cost of production, if we look at competitive against the rest of the world, this is something that is really valuable and important to our growers and, I would argue, equally is valuable and important to the American consumer. Dusty Weis: Mr. Censky, what about you guys at the American Soybean Association? What has been your involvement in trying to protect these crop protection tools? Steve Censky: It has really become an active area. We've always believed in crop protection products, but we really feel like we've had to go and become much more active not only on the legislative or the regulatory side, but also, really a new area where, I think, grower groups are becoming much more active is on the judicial side of things, and that's either going to court and defending the products when they're challenged by various groups or going to court to make sure that the EPA is following the law and following their own science. Steve Censky: We had an example of that just recently where ASA and a number of other groups have challenged the EPA on the decision that they made on chlorpyrifos, which their own career scientists found to be safe for use on soybeans, wheat, and a number of other crops. Unfortunately, they've revoked all tolerances. We think that was wrong. They're not only not following the law, but they're also not following their own science, which they pledged to do. And so it's an area where increasingly, we're having to become much more active, not only the American Soybean Association, but my fellow grower organizations here as well. Dusty Weis: Jon Doggett from the National Corn Growers Association. You guys certainly have crop protection tools that are important to your growers as well, but if these critical tools are scaled back or even limited, there are environmental and climate drawbacks that aren't being discussed here. What are those? Jon Doggett: We've had... all of us have worked more and more over the years with responsible environmental groups. And we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Environmental Defense Fund a few years ago. And I remember when we had the discussion with our board, there were three questions that one of our board members had: where are they going to be on GMOs, where are they going to be on the RFS, and how do I take this back to the coffee shop? And there's a reluctance to go back to the coffee shop and say, \"You know what? We're working [inaudible 00:29:53] community,\" but it has proven to be a good partnership. It's had its up, it's had its downs, but it's an important to have that conversation. Jon Doggett: Increasingly, the environmental community, the responsible environmental community is understanding that if we don't have glyphosate, [inaudible 00:30:09] come back, and all of that carbon that has been stored and all of those soils with all of that conservation tillage or no tillage, that's all gone, and that will far outstrip any issue with a chemical that's been tested for 50 years and found to be safe. Jon Doggett: We really need to continue to bring the environmental community into this discussion, but they have a coffee shop too, and they have big, big donors who have an aversion to a lot of things that our growers do, and so, they've got to work through that process as well. Dusty Weis: Curt Blades, Association of Equipment Manufacturers? Curt Blades: Yeah, so I'm going to come at it from a completely different angle. I don't consume a lot of crop protection products. Equipment manufacturers don't. But we are actively involved in the market, and I think some of the things that we've been doing, because of our unique position with providing the equipment that does the application... I'll give a little story that is how we've been involved in working closely with a lot of the folks here on the stage or organizations here on the stage. We've found that education is so important with EPA and others to talk about, I think, well-intended legislation or well-intended regulation, maybe, but probably ill-advised. Curt Blades: And I can use an example of fugitive dust being a concern of a number of years ago, and the planter manufacturers were being targeted for the fugitive dust issues that was coming from seed-applied pesticides. And basically, we got wind of some regulations that were coming down. It's like, \"Hey, we're going to put a stop on either the seed-applied work or make a very tight prescription on what a planter should look like.\" And again, well-intended. But what we found is having that just simple conversation with the EPA, showing them what the planter looks like and what that means and what we're actively doing to prevent the fugitive dust, changed the conversation from being one of potentially removing some tools from a farmer's arsenal to figuring out ways to deal with that. Curt Blades: So we're partners in the same conversation. We approach it slightly differently because we think that there are some mechanization approaches that can help deal with some of this as well, and we love partnering with all of our friends up here to continue to have those educational conversations with regulators whenever they will listen because there's a story here. And I think Jon, you said it correctly. They've got a coffee shop to go back to as well. If you can help an environmentalist or help a regulator understand that what they're trying to solve might be this thing, but really, they're approaching it incorrectly, that goes a very long way to have those good conversations, so it's a nice thing to be a part of. Dusty Weis: While we're on the topic here of these environmental concerns, I wanted to bring up USDA's $1 billion Climate Smart Ag and Forestry Program. They announced this. It provides the opportunity for serious financial support for farmers across the country. Dusty Weis: And so Chandler Goule from the National Association of Wheat Growers, what type of impact do you see this as having on your industry, and what's your organization looking at as this develops? Chandler Goule: Well, I mean, definitely this has been a main agenda item for the Biden administration, and that is a lot of money to go down to the USDA. Chandler Goule: What we are the most concerned about, though, from the wheat side is we've got winter wheat and we've got spring wheat. So our winter wheat is planted in September, October, depending on what part of the country you're in. It's a living root system. It's a living plant. It's dormant through the winter and then, of course, you harvest it when it comes around spring and summertime. Chandler Goule: Well, a lot of the cover crop programs that they're working on and implementing is going to not be available to over 70% of wheat growers because that's 70% is winter wheat, and so unless you are able to have a cover crop in front of your winter wheat or a cover crop in between spring and maybe your spring wheat and if you're double-cropping something, we're worried that they're going to write this program that doesn't fit the unique production practices that go across our six different classes of wheat and our six major different geographies, where in Washington and Oregon and in the high desert plains, you get six inches of rain a year, so cover crops aren't really an option at all due to moisture to over in the Eastern side of the Mississippi, where we've got growers getting 26 and 27 inches of rain a year. Chandler Goule: So our production systems vary so much within our own commodity, I'm worried that we're going to be left out if there's not enough flexibility. Dusty Weis: Tim Lust from the National Sorghum Producers, when you guys look at the $1 billion Climate Smart Ag and Forestry Program, what are your growers excited about, and what are your concerns? Tim Lust: Well, I think when we look at the opportunity to look at technology advancements, the opportunities that look at how we do things different or better, we're always excited about that. I think it is a crop that certainly fits in this discussion very, very strongly, again, in a geographic manner that may be very different than others up here. It is something that certainly is exciting for us, and we're certainly moving forward to be a part of this and learn from it. Tim Lust: By the same token, we're having a lot of those discussions about the details and the fine details because it is not the same across different geographic areas. It may not even be the same within certain geographic areas from farm to farm. Tim Lust: So we continue to work with our leadership. We've been working on this for several years, been working within NRCS on grants that lead up to this, and it's something that we believe there's future there. But I think we have to understand that this is a learning process and not... I hope it's not seen as we have all the answers because I think certainly, from our crop standpoint, there's still a lot of questions that have to be answered as a part of this process. Dusty Weis: Yeah, certainly. Dusty Weis: Mr. Censky from the American Soybean Association. Steve Censky: Dusty, I was just going to observe it's good that Chandler and I are sitting next to each other because for a lot of our growers in different parts of the country, winter wheat is the cover crop that's growing during the winter and, of course, soybeans are the summer crop that's growing during the summer and so very complementary in keeping that ground protected and keeping it covered. Dusty Weis: Another part of the sustainability picture that I actually got a chance to learn a whole lot about when I worked at AEM with Curt was precision agriculture. Precision agriculture has very measurable, positive benefits for the environment and yet, there's still a lot of room to grow with further implementation as well. Dusty Weis: So Curt, how are farmers adopting these practices, and what do those benefits look like from where you're sitting? Curt Blades: Well, Dusty, you brought up my favorite topic to talk about, so thanks for that. Curt Blades: Precision agriculture is part of the solution. I mean, we talk about all the tools that are available to farmers today, and we've saw dramatic production gains with genetic improvements over the last 20 years. But that center of gravity is quickly moving to the next wave of production gains are quickly coming from precision agriculture, and AEM started a study in partnership with everyone on the stage to try to attempt to quantify the specific environmental gains that come as a direct result of the adoption precision agriculture over the last 20 years. Curt Blades: And what we found is that over the last 20 years, there's been a lot of gains in yield, but we've isolated 4% of the gains have come directly from precision agriculture. And when you put those into real terms we're talking about a significant savings of acres. We're talking about a significant savings of fuel. We're talking about significant savings of water, about significant savings of correctly applied fertilizer and reduction of active ingredient of crop protection. Curt Blades: So you kind of add all those things up together and that environmental message is huge and being able to tell that story to, again, the environmental community and the general public as a whole has proven to be very powerful over the last two years. In fact, the bill you referenced earlier has got in its heart some of that study that we all jointly funded together that speaks to innovation is part of the solution to address some of the yields that face our planet. Curt Blades: And here's the cool part: farmers aren't buying precision agriculture because they're trying to save the planet. They're buying precision agriculture because it makes really good sense for their businesses and the environmental benefits are a ride along. Curt Blades: And I think we look at some of the cool technology that's downstairs. It just gets even better. Those gains that we're seeing today and we see adoption because of rural broadband and other things, oh, [inaudible 00:38:14], it's going to be fun to look at the next 10 years of what the environmental footprint looks like of agriculture just by doing the right things and hopefully, farmers making some good money in the process along the way. Dusty Weis: Jon Doggett from the National Corn Growers Association, you have a phrase of which you're quite fond and I'll try to do it justice here. But you like to say, \"If you haven't been on a corn farm in the last 10 years, you haven't been on a corn farm.\" So how are corn growers adopting some of these new technologies as it regards precision agriculture? Jon Doggett: Sure. It's not 10 years. It's 5. Dusty Weis: Five years is... Jon Doggett: True. Dusty Weis: ... it'll be three years before too long, the rate things are going. Jon Doggett: It's just, the innovation continues to go and continues to go and continues to go, and so when I talk to non-ag audiences, I say, \"We've made all these wonderful gains in how we do business, but what did your cellphone look like 25 years ago?\" \"Well, I didn't have a cellphone 25 years ago.\" \"What did your cellphone look like 10 years ago? It probably didn't look like this.\" Why do you think that this technology has moved faster than the technology that's on the farm? Jon Doggett: I think we got remember that as all of society has embraced more and more new technologies, we need to make sure that they're understanding we're doing that as well, and precision ag is just such a neat thing. And when you talk to folks that are not involved in agriculture about how you can regulate seeds, you can regulate chemicals, you can regulate fertilizer, I mean, it is just absolutely amazing the things that we can do. And when you talk to non-ag audiences about that, it's kind of a gee-whiz moment, and I think it's really important for us to continue to talk about the gee-whiz moment because there's a lot of folks in our society that really like this technology and they want to know about somebody else's technology. I think it gives us an opportunity. Dusty Weis: We've got executives from five of the most influential agriculture organizations on the planet sitting on this stage right now, and so I'm curious. I'll serve this up to whoever wants it, but what role do you have as an organization in encouraging growers to adopt more of these precision agriculture practices, and how do you go about doing that? Tim Lust: Well, I think most of us work closely with our sister organizations on checkoff side, and I think one of the things that I would just say is getting it in front of growers. Obviously, we all work closely with private industry as well in testing these technologies. I'll just relate a story on some of the new weed technology that's coming out on spot- and spray-type technology. First time our growers ever saw that technology that I believe was developed in the center part of the US, first time I ever saw it was on a sorghum farm in Eastern Australia. It's the first time I ever saw it operational. Tim Lust: And so I think part of it is seeing what is working for other farmers around the world and what are those opportunities, and so we continue to be involved on all sides, whether it is equipment or chemistry side of what technology is. And again, Jon, I'm agreeing with you a lot, man, today. Tim Lust: In terms of one of the things that said is, \"Don't bet against technology,\" and I think we're not. We're excited about what technology is doing in agriculture today, and our members continue to just enhance and take up that technology day after day. Dusty Weis: I did want to make sure that we covered the Farm Bill. Of course, that's something that's on everybody's radar right now. Dusty Weis: Chandler Goule, National Association of Wheat Growers, can you tell us what your organization is doing now to assure that the farm community's needs are going to be considered for the 2023 reauthorization? Chandler Goule: Well, that's exactly what we were just discussing about an hour ago and all day yesterday here at Commodity Classic. Though, normally, we do come out of Commodity Classic with our priorities set, that's going to be more of a June timeframe, I think, for NOG, and I've heard my other colleagues up here say the same for their commodities, really, because I want to see the House and sitting AG Committee principals come out with where their concerns are and what they're interested in, so I can see where we're going to work together and where I need to educate them more on. And so we're going to continue to work on them, but maintaining that flexibility between ARC and PLC is going to be crucial. Chandler Goule: Any additional authorities that may be add to Title II programs to help the Biden administration reach their climate initiative goals, we want to make sure has that flexibility in there, for wheat's always got a unique concern, so that's going to be key for us as well. Chandler Goule: But then also, just continue to reach out to all those new members who have never voted on a farm bill. So we had a PAC update, which is another reason we come to Commodity classic, this morning. And depending on what happens in the election, we are easily looking at 50% or more of the House Agriculture Committee never have voted on a farm bill. So just the amount of education when you've got to go and talk Title I, Title II, Title III crop insurance, that's going to be, I think, the biggest component is making sure those members are educated and make informed decisions that will support US wheat growers and all farmers. Dusty Weis: Mr. Steven Censky from the American Soybean Association, are there any specific programs that are near and dear to your heart that you want to make sure are considered in the 2023 reauthorization? Steve Censky: Certainly, and we have begun that process as well. We've held 12 Farm Bill listening sessions already, title by title, so we've had five by title and then seven by regions where we wanted to get input from growers. We also have conducted a Farm Bill survey to get that input as well. Steve Censky: I think a lot of the feedback that we're hearing is strongly in support of voluntary, incentive-based conservation programs. We are wanting to maintain those and make sure that there's adequate funding and technical assistance to help growers implement that conservation on the ground. Steve Censky: We're hearing strong, strong support for crop insurance. Over 90% of soybean acres are covered by crop insurance, and that remains the most fundamental element for soybean farmers of their risk management portfolio. Steve Censky: And then on Title I for the Farm Safety Net, what we have heard, really, are two things. One is that the soybean reference price, they believe, is too low. And you take a look at the trade war that we had with China. It still didn't trigger any kind of payments under the Title I Safety Net, and so that's something we would like to have taken a look at to see if that can be addressed and then a base update, a voluntary base update. We're close to 90 million acres of soybeans that are planted, but only a little over 60 million acres of those have base. And we've heard from growers in some regions of the country where you have young beginning farmers that are farming ground that maybe only has 10 or 15% base on it because it used to be pasture or alfalfa or ponds or tobacco farms, whatever it is. Steve Censky: And so those are some of the priorities that we've heard thus far. Dusty Weis: You mentioned crop insurance there, and it's a hot topic. Yeah, I mean, we're coming off of a year here where we've seen droughts, derechos, unseasonable freeze events, high winds, other extreme weather, and that's just in the last two months, what I've seen in my newsfeed from that. Dusty Weis: So Tim Lust from the National Sorghum Producers, as we're looking back at the past couple years and the weather that we've seen and this seeming trend toward more extreme weather events, could you speak to the importance of crop insurance and how your organization is working with Congress and the administration on getting that additional assistance to growers? Tim Lust: Certainly and we just echo the important of crop insurance overall. We've worked through multiple farm bills in the past for some formulas to change, the price selection component for sorghum and allow that to track markets and change over time and happy to say that that's working and is something that's been very good for our industry. Tim Lust: I think we also, in this discussion, that you have to separate crop insurance out and then you have to separate, as you mentioned, some of this disaster challenges. And so certainly, for our membership, the WHIP+ for '20 and '21 is something that we're looking to get delivered to the country. Our growers need that and so continue to have those discussions with USDA and continue to also evaluate that from a policy standpoint, as far as future legislation. Don't have any positions from a sorghum industry standpoint. We're just doing the analysis, really, to say, \"What does this look like? What might be the right fit, or how might that work together in the future?\" Dusty Weis: Jon Doggett from the National Corn Growers Association, I'll say there's nothing so dramatic as a cornfield that's been flattened by a derecho. It's just makes your hair stand on end, but crop insurance, anything to add? Jon Doggett: If we want to bring the next generation of farmers to the farm and those folks will better be able to use the technology that Curt's folks are producing, they can do that, but they have to have risk management tools because they're going to be in a different position than that farmer who's 60 years old who has the capital resources to go ahead and handle a weather event. Jon Doggett: So crop insurance is really, really vital to younger growers, and we need more fresh blood back at the farm, and so those risk management tools are really, really important, not just to keep the economic viability going on the farm, but really, to continue to hold onto our rural communities and our rural values, but you got to have young people to do that.

    "title": "Corn Growers Thank President Biden for Counting on Biofuels to Lower Costs, Boost Energy Independence",
    "content": "President Biden announced today that his administration would use existing authority to prevent drivers from losing access to lower-cost and lower-emission E15, a higher ethanol blend often marketed as Unleaded 88. The president made the announcement at a POET ethanol production facility in Menlo, Iowa, and NCGA President Chris Edgington participated in the event. “Corn growers thank President Biden for ensuring drivers continue to have access to a lower-cost fuel choice and acknowledging how renewable ethanol helps reduce prices, lower emissions and improve our nation’s energy security,” said Edgington. “Farmers are proud to contribute to cleaner, less expensive fuel choices.” A 2021 court decision resulting from oil industry efforts to limit the growth of higher ethanol blends was set to end full-market access for E15 beginning this summer, absent action from the Biden administration or Congress. With a host of factors driving up gas prices, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, NCGA and farmer leaders across the country asked the president to extend the use of E15 to hold down prices at the pump. Farmers also asked their Members of Congress to support the continued availability of E15, sending them thousands of messages in recent weeks and backing bipartisan Senate and House advocacy for the action announced today. Ethanol has been priced an average of 80 cents less per gallon than unblended gasoline at wholesale through March, and drivers currently save up to 20 cents or more per gallon where E15 is available. Ethanol adds billions of gallons to the U.S. fuel supply every year, lowering demand for high-cost oil while increasing the total fuel available to consumers. Corn farmers’ increased productivity and efficiency have resulted in higher yields, using fewer resources to meet food, feed and fuel needs to help keep prices down. Moreover, allowing continued E15 sales through the summer keeps a lower-emission fuel in the marketplace. E15 has lower volatility than regular fuel, which is a 10% ethanol blend, and using E15 results in lower evaporative and exhaust emissions, important during the summer driving season. Farmers stand ready to continue working with President Biden, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack and Congress on energy and environmental solutions that ethanol provides, Edgington said.",

    "title": "Sustainability Series Geared to Help Corn in Getting to Goal",
    "content": "In support of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) mission to create and increase opportunities for corn growers and the vision to sustainably feed and fuel a growing world, NCGA leaders established five U.S. Corn Sustainability Goals for 2030. While the goals are achievable, it will take a unified and concerted effort to support farmers in moving the conservation needle. The “Getting to Goal” sustainability webinar series for state and national staff is designed to offer relevant resources and create relationship-building opportunities in order to support on-the-ground efforts for continuous environmental improvements. The series kicked off with two sessions in the fall of 2021 and has reemerged this spring: “The Economics of Sustainability” – October 26, 2021 Dr. Michelle Perez of American Farmland Trust shared summaries of nine soil health economics case studies (conducted through an NRCS CIG) and highlighted the downloadable Retrospective Soil Health Economic Calculator (R-SHEC) as well as the Predictive Soil Health Economic Calculator (P-SHEC). Dr. Wayne Honeycutt of the Soil Health Institute presented the results of a project to assess the economics of soil health practice adoption on 100 farms. Through farmer interviews and economic analysis, SHI found that growers who have adopted soil health management systems decreased production costs and increased income, with 85% of corn farmers showing a net income increase. “Putting NRCS to Work for U.S. Corn Farmers” – November 9, 2021 Noller Herbert (Central Region), James Tillman (Southeast Region), Terrell Erickson (Northeast Region), and Astor Boozer (West Region) discussed the locally-led conservation process—including both local working groups and state technical committees—and provided an overview of conservation programs and upcoming opportunities. In addition, all four NRCS Regional Conservationists shared ideas for strengthening relationships between NRCS and corn state affiliates. “How do We Measure Progress Towards the Goals?” – April 7, 2022 Kelly Murray Young of Field to Market presented an overview of the latest National Indicators Report that Field to Market released in December 2021. She focused on the corn data and the progress made in the five metrics over the last four decades. Dr. Gary Schnitkey of iFAR LLP presented the results of a report NCGA commissioned to translate the 2021 National Indicators Report data into the benchmarks for measuring of progress toward NCGA’s environmental sustainability goals. He also covered what it would take to reach the 2030 goals. “Working with Conservation Foundations and Funders” – April 21, 2022 State and national association staff may still register for this next webinar in the series, which will feature a presentation by: David Gagner, senior director of Government Affairs and External Relations of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and Paul Wolfe, program officer of the Walton Family Foundation for the Environment Program.",

    "title": "Biofuel & Ag Leaders Respond to EPA Decision to Reverse Refinery Exemptions, Decry Lack of Real Market Impact",
    "content": "Top farm and biofuel leaders responded to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) decision to reverse 31 controversial small refinery exemptions (SREs) granted in August 2019 and expressed disappointment with EPA’s decision to allow refineries with previously-granted SREs to not have to take additional actions to meet their obligations under the RFS by blending more biofuel or purchasing additional Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). Biofuel and farm advocates had challenged the exemptions in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, forcing the agency to reevaluate its approval for select oil refiners to avoid their obligations under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Leaders at Growth Energy, Renewable Fuels Association, National Corn Growers Association, Clean Fuels Alliance America, American Coalition for Ethanol, and National Farmers Union released the following statement on yesterday's decision from EPA: “While today’s decision is an important step in reversing past abuse of refinery exemptions, the decision fails to remedy the economic harms the improperly granted 2018 SREs have already caused. Low-carbon biofuels are the single best tool to deliver immediate relief at the pump, strengthen U.S. energy security, and protect the climate. EPA’s move to hold refiners accountable to the law is a welcome step toward getting the RFS back on track that, when applied to pending and future SRE petitions, would improve certainty in the marketplace, and lead to more blending of American-made biofuels. However, EPA’s readiness to excuse individual refineries from their obligations to comply with 2018 blending requirements comes at the expense of our biofuels producers, farmers, and American consumers.” Background: In August 2019, the Trump Administration EPA approved an unprecedented 31 SREs for the 2018 RVO compliance year with only a cursory, two-page decision. This coalition of biofuels and ag leaders filed a petition in the D.C. Circuit Court challenging EPA’s decision. The coalition asked the court to stay the 2018 SRE case in November 2019 pending the outcome of related litigation in both the 10th Circuit and D.C. Circuit Courts. In January 2020, the 10th Circuit ruled in Renewable Fuels Association et al. v. EPA that EPA has no power to ‘extend’ an exemption that had lapsed. The Court also held that EPA lacks the authority to grant an exemption based on hardships not caused by RFS compliance, and also found that it was arbitrary and capricious for EPA to ignore its own prior studies showing that refiners recoup RFS compliance costs. On June 25, 2021, in HollyFrontier v. Renewable Fuels Association, the Supreme Court vacated the 10th Circuit’s holding that EPA may only ‘extend’ continuously pre-existing exemptions but the other two holdings from the 10th Circuit decision remained intact. Thus, EPA had the opportunity to apply the other two 10th Circuit precedents not challenged in the HollyFrontier case and request a remand and vacatur of the 31 SREs at issue in the D.C. Circuit. However, on August 25, 2021, EPA instead filed a motion to remand the SREs without vacatur. In response, the D.C. Circuit remanded the exemptions back to EPA, but, as a result of this biofuel coalition’s motion in opposition, required the agency to make new determinations on the contested SREs no later than April 7, 2022.",

The four ambassadors in attendance—Claire Menard, Alden Perkins, Dylan Schoemaker and Corey Schultz—were able to experience the trade show, talk one-on-one with growers, network with Nourish the Future teacher leaders and attend Corn Congress. “I spend less than 14 days in a cornfield, so talking at length with farmers was eye-opening. Somewhere there is a massive disconnect between farmers and academia,” noted Corey Schultz, a graduate student from the University of Georgia. “I know the farmers here were the cream of the crop—the most active and the most forward-thinking—but I had many misconceptions about farmers dispelled.” In its inaugural year, the Research Ambassador Program, an initiative of NCGA’s Sustainable Ag Research Action Team (SARAT), focuses on building a network of future leaders in the agricultural sector and ultimately building a stronger connection directly between the research lab and the farm field. The awardees for this academic year were selected by a panel of SARAT members. “Not only did our Research Ambassadors get an invaluable experience, so did the growers and corn grower staff who were able to interact with them during their time at Classic,” said Nebraska corn grower and SARAT Chair Jason Lewis. “Another unforeseen benefit of the Research Ambassadors’ presence at Classic was the dynamic interaction they had with the teacher leaders from the Nourish the Future. Our SARAT members are committed to finding avenues to inspire students to consider a career in agriculture—these interactions over four days gained us great strides in that effort.” To learn more or apply for the upcoming 2022-2023 academic year, visit: NCGA Research Ambassador Program.",

    "title": "Growers Welcome EPA Decision on Enlist, Hope for Continued Progress and Lessons Learned",
    "content": "Grower groups including the American Soybean Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, National Corn Growers Association, and National Cotton Council welcomed and expressed appreciation for an announcement from EPA that will restore use of Enlist herbicides to many U.S. counties. This label amendment, prompted by new data submitted to EPA, lifts county-level bans on use of Enlist and Enlist Duo in 134 counties across multiple states, including those where the American Burying Beetle is alleged to be present. Brad Doyle, soy farmer from Arkansas and president of the American Soybean Association, welcomed the announcement, stating, “County-level bans had growers in these areas anxious and frustrated when the announcement came out in January – especially in this market where inputs are scarce and costs are sky high. We appreciate EPA hearing our concerns and working to quickly restore access in many counties where science and data support doing so.” \"On behalf of corn farmers, we would like to thank the EPA for expeditiously reviewing the data and lifting the corresponding restrictions,” said Iowa farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Chris Edgington. The grower groups hope the Enlist decision has provided EPA a good learning opportunity to instruct future registration decisions. Growers have been very critical of bans affecting entire counties where protected species may be present in only a fraction of the county or potentially not at all, or where conservative methods have overestimated the impact on some species. Announcements of new restrictions just weeks ahead of planting after many growers have already received products has also been stressful to producers. Numerous counties remain under county-level bans following EPA’s latest decision. The groups hope the agency will continue reviewing data that might allow use to be restored in those areas, as well. American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall responded, “AFBF is glad EPA is partially stepping back from its decision to restrict critically needed herbicides right before spring planting. It is essential that EPA continue to work with farmers to understand the impacts of its decisions. Products like Enlist enable farmers to utilize environmentally beneficial practices that preserve the soil, minimize fuel use, and capture carbon. We hope EPA is cognizant of timing constraints, supply chain challenges, and the implications of various restrictions in future pesticide decisions.” Stephen Logan, chairman of the National Cotton Council’s Environmental Task Force and cotton producer from Louisiana, expressed appreciation that EPA continues to refine the science necessary to comply with the ESA and FIFRA mandates, stating, \"Many mitigations are already in place, and others—such as reasonable buffers—provide species protection without banning use for the whole county. I hope EPA and the Services continue to refine their decision process and credit farmers for our environmental stewardship actions on our farmlands.” In January, EPA issued new seven-year registrations for over-the-top use of herbicides Enlist and Enlist Duo on herbicide-tolerant corn, cotton, and soybeans. While the new registrations were welcome and worked for many growers across the country, producers in 217 counties disproportionally concentrated in several states were impacted by county-level bans, risking production in affected counties amidst ongoing supply chain challenges. Grower groups have urged EPA to review additional data that may allow for lifting county-level bans and view today’s announcement as a significant step toward that outcome.",

    "title": "EP. 31 - Smooth Sailing on River Transportation Infrastructure, with Jim Tarmann and Tracy Zea",
    "content": "Jon celebrates a big win in Congress with the leaders of the Illinois Corn Growers and the Waterways Council. The Mississippi River transports 60% of American corn and soybean exports to market. The massive barges that ply America’s waterways are more cost-effective than any other form of transportation, and also play a role in getting vital inputs to growers. And yet, much of the infrastructure that makes this possible hasn’t been updated since the 1930s… until now. In this episode, we talk about a key win for the NCGA and other groups who have spent decades pushing Congress to act on this critical infrastructure problem. Joining us are Jim Tarmann, the managing director with Illinois Corn Growers, and Tracy Zea, the president and CEO of the Waterways Council, which is an association dedicated to advocating for a modern national system of inland waterway infrastructure. We discuss how we got to this point, what it means for growers in the Midwest, and what comes next. DIRECT SHARE TRANSCRIPT Tracy Zea: Barge transportation is the most fuel-efficient surface mode of transportation. And the reason for that is the capacity that these barges can hold. A 45 barge tow is equivalent to a U.S. aircraft carrier. So if you think about that size going down the river, that you don't see or you don't hear about, it's pretty impressive to think about. Dusty Weis: Hello and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, The National Corn Growers Association Podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host association CEO, Jon Doggett. From the fields of the corn belt to the D.C. beltway, we're making sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. The Mississippi River transports 60% of American corn and soybean exports to market. The massive barges that ply America's waterways are more cost effective than any other form of transportation and also play a key role in getting vital inputs to growers. And yet, most of the infrastructure that makes this possible hasn't been updated since the 1930s that is until now. Dusty Weis: In this episode, we talk about a key win for the NCGA and other groups who have spent decades pushing Congress to act on this critical infrastructure problem. But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also, make sure to follow the NCGA on Twitter @nationalcorn and sign up for the National Corn Guard Association newsletter at ncga.com. Dusty Weis: And with that, it's time to once again introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. And Jon, super great to be here in New Orleans with you. We're here for Commodity Classic, America's largest farmer-led, farmer-focused, agricultural and educational experience. And Jon, exports are a pressing issue right now, we've got the war in Ukraine cutting off valuable commodities from that country. And the world is going to be increasingly turning to U.S. farmers to fill that void. Jon Doggett: Dusty, U.S. farmers are going to do their part to meet the world's demand, but you have to have infrastructure to get that crop down the river and to the port and overseas. And we've been working a long, long time on the Upper Mississippi River system and the locks and dams there that are getting pretty antiquated and certainly need to be upgraded. Some of these locks and dams have been here since the 1930s, they've led to breakdowns. It's a real problem and one that has been very costly for U.S. agriculture. But thanks recently to a bipartisan effort in Congress, the infrastructure investment and jobs act was signed into law and it designated billions of dollars to updating the aging locks and dams along the system. But you know, this didn't happen overnight. And we were talking before we started here a few minutes ago, it's 20 plus years of education and advocacy. And two of the people who have spent a good portion of their career doing this work are with us today. Jon Doggett: And I'd like to welcome Jim Tarmann, he's the managing director with Illinois Corn Growers, and also with us is Tracy Zea, he's the president and CEO of the Waterways Council, the association dedicated to advocating for a modern national system of inland waterway infrastructure. So gentlemen, welcome and thanks for being part of the podcast. Tracy Zea: Thanks for having us. Jim Tarmann: Yeah, it's great to be here, Jon. Jon Doggett: So before we get into questions, I'm going to ask you each to take a minute and talk about your organization. Talk about yourself and what do you do here. So Jim, start with you. Jim Tarmann: So I've been on staff with Illinois Corn now I'm entering my 29th year. Illinois Corn Growers Association was formed back in 1972. If I look back, I've been with them for about half of their existence, but my role with corn growers over time has grown. One of the issues that I've tracked very closely, that we're going to be talking about today is the locks and dams and their importance to not only Illinois, but the Midwest. So our organization currently has plus or minus 4,000 members, and we're located in Bloomington, Normal, Illinois. Jon Doggett: Tracy? Tracy Zea: I haven't been with Waterways Council as long as Jim's been with Illinois Corn Growers. I've been with Waterways Council for about eight years now. Waterways Council, we are Washington, D.C. based association that advocates for modern, efficient, reliable, inland waterway transportation systems. So what does that actually mean? It means locks and dams, which we're here to talk about today. We are a fairly young association when it comes to Washington, D.C. standards. National Corn Growers has been around, I believe 65 years, next year Waterways Council will be our 20th year. Our membership is very diverse and it's a successful coalition. We have a makeup of operators that actually push the barges, the boats that push the barges then the shippers. We have National Corn Growers, but also nine state corn associations. It's a very successful partnership with ag that we truly do appreciate. And we wouldn't be where we are here today, discussing this major win in the infrastructure bill without ag. So we want to say thank you to that. Tracy Zea: But also an interesting part of our membership is we have the skilled building traits. Right now, every lock that is being constructed is being constructed by organized labor. And they have really opened up doors to our membership that has helped pushed our advocacy efforts on Capitol Hill pretty far along. And then to make it even more funky, we have environmental groups such as Nature Conservancy and Ducks Unlimited that support us. So it's a collective organization that we take great pride in. And we're thankful for the support from National Corn Growers as well as Illinois Corn Growers and all the corn growers. Jon Doggett: A very unique coalition of folks that you've brought together. We're going to talk about that in a few minutes, but Jim, in the meantime, tell us about the Upper Mississippi River and it's importance to farmers. The farmers you represent in Illinois, what's their take on the lock and dam situation and its importance? Jim Tarmann: Well, I guess one of the easiest statement that I usually make about that is you have your east and west coast. And I call the Upper Mississippi River basin our third coast for the Midwest for getting our products. Illinois, for example, more than 40% of the corn that we grow in the state of Illinois is exported via the Illinois and Mississippi rivers. If you add soybeans into that, corn and soybeans collectively together, that's over 60% of our corn and soybeans are exported through the lock and dam system. I mean, quite frankly, we're blessed to have that system. We have all six class one railroads. We have both river systems and we have a strong ethanol processing. So of all the states, the competition that we have and what the river system means to that competition gives us a strong basis in Illinois. Jon Doggett: A lot of inputs come up the river for farmers. Jim Tarmann: Absolutely. Grain goes down and inputs come up. So it's very important. And you go on up into Chicago, Chicago Hair gets all of their aviation fuel delivered via the river system. And if you think about how many trucks that takes off the road, plus the safety component of that. I know over time the rail industry has kind of backed away from certain products on delivery just because logistically where they have to travel through some of our major cities and crossings, and sometimes they refuse to carry some of our products. We're blessed that we have the river system to bring it right up through there. It works 24/7, 365. And I would guess that part of our problem is, it operates, like I said, 24/7, 365, and nobody even really knows it. Dusty Weis: You know, there's something to that if I can chime in here, and this might be the nerdiest thing that I've ever said on your podcast, Jon. Jon Doggett: Boy, that's a high bar. Dusty Weis: That's a high bar to clear, but I'm going to say it anyway. Locks and dams, I would say are the most underrated piece of infrastructure that exists. And I say this for this reason, my wife and kids and I, we were vacationing in Southwest Wisconsin a couple of summers ago. And at one point we had an afternoon to kill and I told my wife, let's just take the kids down, we'll pack a picnic lunch, and we're going to sit in the grass alongside the lock and dam, just north of Prairie du Chien, right there on the Mississippi River. And my wife looks at me and says, \"You want to sit and watch boats?\" And I'm like, I do. And it's going to be the most entertaining thing that we do this week. Dusty Weis: And she thought I was nuts, but then we got out there and you see these massive barges coming and going through the lock and dam going up, going down, you've got trains running alongside right there, along the Mississippi River. My kid was two and a half years old at the time and he just had a field day. He was giddy. And you see the scale of those barges, Tracy, and you just have to wonder, holy cow, how does that stack up compared to other forms of transportation in terms of efficiency? They're just so much bigger than trains, so much bigger than semi-trucks. It just has to be a much more efficient way to travel. Tracy Zea: Yeah, you bring up a good point, especially about the river system and locks and dams being out of sight out of mind. We like to call it the silent R, roads, rail and runways are kind of in the forefront when you think of infrastructure and the river is traditionally not. To give you interesting fact to what you guys talked about inputs coming up the river. So speaking of the Upper Mississippi River system, north of St. Louis, it traditionally has cold winters. So road salt is an unspoken commodity that traditionally helps everyday Americans that people don't realize. As far as the efficiency and the ability that barges are able to handle, barge transportation is the most fuel efficient surface motor transportation. And the reason for that is the capacity that these barges can hold. One 15 average tow barge that goes through a lock is equivalent to over a thousand trucks on the road. Tracy Zea: So wear and tear to your daily roads is taken off, but also safety. Truck accidents are high and the river system has the best safety rating of any surface transportation. One fact that I really like to tell that really puts things into a perspective. Once you go south of St. Louis, there's no locks and dams on the Mississippi River. So where we gain the most efficiency is they couple up all the barges and you have 45 barge tows. So a 45 barge tow is equivalent to a U.S. aircraft carrier. So if you think about that size going down the river, that you don't see, or you don't hear about, it's pretty impressive to think about all the commodities in there, everything from agriculture to energy products that just really help keep one American competitive on foreign markets, but also help drive down costs for your average American. Jon Doggett: So you talk about a 45 barge tow, but how many problems are now created by the current system in order to get that 45 barge tow put together below St. Louis? You've got some problems between wherever they started and wherever they got. So what's going on with these antiquated locks and dams, and why is it vital that they get replaced? Tracy Zea: That is a very, very good question, Jon. So the problem is these locks and dams, as you mentioned in your opening statement were constructed in the 1930s. What was going on during the 1930s? We had steam vessels pushing barges. Well, just like modern ingenuity, there's been advancements in the way that motors work and we are able to push larger barges. So obviously tow sizes have outgrown these locks. Right now, the average size of the lock is 600 feet. So there's a process called decoupling that has to take place on the river system where you pull half of the barges into the actual lock, then you have to reverse all the way back out the lock. Then they have to take a rope system and pull the barges in the lock, through the lock, then refill the lock, go back in, do the whole process again, then tie back up. Which again, you're putting safety at Mariners because the more time they're out tying and untying boats, is more opportunity for something to happen. But that process right there at a 600-foot lock takes about two to two and a half hours. Tracy Zea: So if you start in Minneapolis, you're going to have to go through 20 plus locks before you get down to the 45, which adds cost to your ag shippers and also to the operators, it's fuel burned. But if you upgrade these locks like Lock and Dam 25 is that got infrastructure funding to 1200 feet, it's only going to take 45 minutes. That's a significant increase that we see. Dusty Weis: You don't have to decouple. You just pull it in and go. Tracy Zea: Pull it in and rock and roll. Jim Tarmann: I was just going to say the two to two and a half hours is kind of a generous time. And that's if everything is working correctly. And I know Tracy would probably agree that in my time being out on the river and advocating, I don't think I've ever seen a tow on time or something not go wrong with something. So, I mean, you're looking at delays sometimes at some blocks of four, even six hours because something goes wrong. Jon Doggett: And you have to do it 20 times. Jim Tarmann: Well, and you can see right away with those delays and question of reliability, how you've not seen a lot of investments above the St Louis area just because of that. The St. Louis has kind of become the hub for that. And I think in the last 30 years, since I've been around the only investment that I've seen above St. Louis was one ethanol plant. I mean, other modes of transportation have gradually compensated for an unreliable system. Jon Doggett: So Tracy Zea, president and CEO of the Waterways Council, talk about the infrastructure investment in jobs act and what's that going to do to make things better? Tracy Zea: So the infrastructure and jobs act was monumental win for the inland waterways. 2.5 billion was included for inland waterway construction. Those funds were released in January and that funded five projects to completion out of the 15 projects that are currently authorized in our backlog. So one-third of our backlog is completed, that is something. If you look at appropriations, the last 13 years is the same amount for a dollar if you add up the 2.5. But what does agriculture care about? What does the corn growers care about? Is a program called the Navigation Ecosystem Sustainability Program, which was authorized in 2007. It was to modernize seven locks and dams, five on the Upper Mississippi River, two on the Illinois River. And what was big in this infrastructure and jobs act was 732 million provided for Lock and Dam 25 to give everyone a little history, the Navigation Ecosystem Sustainability, NESP program, began study phase in 1991. It was authorized in 2007 and received its first construction funding in 2022. Tracy Zea: So you're looking at 31 years of a process. People have spent a long time of their career such as Jim advocating for this program and- Jim Tarmann: No, not at all. Tracy Zea: And it is just a major win because these locks are outdated as we talked about earlier, they don't accommodate the average tow size, but it really decreases the American farmers' competitiveness in foreign markets. Dusty Weis: Jim, it's cool to hear about how these upgrades are going to be made to the locks and dams, but what does this mean for corn growers, particularly in Illinois, but all throughout the Midwest? What sort of changes are they going to expect to see short-term and long-term here in terms of getting their grain to market and getting the inputs that they need? Jim Tarmann: So as Tracy was talking about, there's seven locks and dams that were part of the authorization in 2007 and we just got the first one. So we won't realize the total benefits until all of them are going to be completed. But you're going to see the draw back to the river. Right now just a certain draw area based on the cost of transportation. Well, as that transportation becomes more efficient, that draw area goes out farther. So we'll see more grain going down as world demand continues to grow around the world. I can remember when we first started advocating, we were watching very closely and I had an opportunity to go down to South America and take a look at their infrastructure system that they've been wanting to upgrade. And they've been very slow about that, but I didn't think anybody could be that slow, but we were even slower than that with upgrading ours. Jim Tarmann: So really just getting the ball rolling on that efficiency, hoping probably within the next eight to 10 years will have all seven locks completed and up and going. And like I mentioned earlier, we really believe that investment will come back to the river system just because how efficient it is. You know, if we're moving more toward a more climate-friendly type transportation, you can't find a better one than the river system. Tracy Zea: So Jim mentioned the stat on draw about rivers. So right now, according to the core of engineers with a 600 foot river chamber, it's a hundred miles. If you're within a hundred miles of the river, you're going to bring your product to the river. And they claim, if you go up to 1200 feet locks, it'll go out to 200 miles for the river. Jon Doggett: So what happens when one of the locks goes down, what happens to corn prices? Tracy Zea: So if a lock goes down right now on the Upper Mississippi River, it shuts down the hole in the waterway transportation system. And the reason for that is there's only one lock chamber. So what NESP is going to do is add another lock chamber at 1200 feet. So if one of those lock chambers go down, you can still move your product. Jim Tarmann: Specific to price. When hurricane Katrina happened, we saw basis or corn price dropped 50 cents and the river system was shut down for more than 30 days. So 50 cents is what we lost. Dusty Weis: Nothing could get through the port of New Orleans [crosstalk 00:17:03] Jim Tarmann: Same thing would happen as Tracy alluded in the Upper Mississippi. Right now, we just have a one way street, if you will. So if one goes down, it's amazing how you'll have 50, 60, 15 barge tows sitting on the river system as far as the eye can see, waiting for the lock to come up. And we've seen that before too. Tracy Zea: There's a study done by the National Waterways Foundation on what would happen for an unexpected long closure. So a year duration. And it was pretty remarkable about the study. They surveyed shippers in it came back that 50% of shippers if the lock system went down would go to other modes and never come back to the waterway transportation system. On rates going down, obviously when the lock goes down, rail rates and other modes of truck and other surface transportation modes rates go up. So it's more costly to the shipper. Jon Doggett: One of the things I'd like you to explain for us is, there's a fund that helps run the locks and dams and the inland waterways. How does that work? Tracy Zea: Yeah, so the fund Jon's talking about is the inland waterway trust fund. This is a per gallon of diesel fuel tax. We used to be 20 cents up until 2015 when industry, as far as the operators pushing the barges and shippers all got together and recognized the need to update our infrastructure and these fuel tax dollars go to update our infrastructure, got together, went to Capitol Hill and asked lawmakers for an increase in their taxes, which a lot of Republicans about fell out of their chair when- Jim Tarmann: I never will forget when we went to the Hill and now let me get this right, you want to tax yourself? Well, yes we do as long as it goes to what its intended purpose for. So it probably took two or three trips before they got it into their head that somebody was coming in to tax themselves. Tracy Zea: So the tax was 20 cents. It was raised 45% in 2015, it's up to 29 cents a gallon of fuel. So what does this inland water trust fund pay for? It pays for the modernization of locks and dams. So it pays for 35% of new construction and major rehabilitation. Jon Doggett: So Lock and Dam 25, how long is it going to take? Tracy Zea: That's a million-dollar question. If you look at the last several lock projects, Olmsted Lock and Dam, which is on the Ohio River, that took almost 30 years of construction time. And if you look back at the 1930s, when Lock and Dam 25 was in construction, it took about six years. So recognizing right now, the time in America inflation just went up, what? 0.8% to 7.9 and worker shortage, we have better equipment now, bulldozers and tractors, we're hoping that the core can construct and have Lock and Dam 25 up and running in a six to eight year timeframe. It's a major construction project. It's 732 million. We hope they can get it done a lot sooner, but I would expect a six to eight year timeframe. Jim Tarmann: The big key to that is, it just wasn't a partial appropriation to start Lock 25. It was here you go, here's 732 million, go forth and build it. So they'll go out for bids. I assume Tracy, probably this summer, fall, I've heard as early as springtime to see actual shovel go into the ground, but what's great about it again is it's funded from start to finish. So you don't have contractors coming back and forth like we saw at Olmstead Lock and Dam, they run out of money and then they didn't know whether there was another appropriation going to come. So the construction company would leave and go somewhere else or whatever. Then they'd have to show up to the site again when money became available. So it's very inefficient. Tracy Zea: If you look at the last project the core did, that was fully funded to completion like Lock and Dam 25. The core got upfront full funding and it came in under budget and on time or ahead of schedule. So they have a track record where they can expedite when they are given the funding. And this is a great opportunity through this infrastructure plan for the core to show that they can construct these locks. Jon Doggett: What's the next big project after 25? Tracy Zea: That's a good question that we have an answer for Jon at Waterways Council and I think- Jim Tarmann: I'll answer it, LaGrange. Tracy Zea: Jim is correct. LaGrange Lock and Dam. So the users of the inland waterway system have a federal advisory board called the Inland Waterway User Board that partners with the core of engineers on something called the capital investment strategy. This is a document that racks and stacks projects they put them in tier system. So the infrastructure funding funded three out of the four tier A projects. The last tier A project is LaGrange Lock and Dam. Dusty Weis: And that is where? Tracy Zea: It's the first lock on the Illinois River as you leave the Mississippi River. So it is actually close to- Dusty Weis: Beardstown. Tracy Zea: Beardstown, Illinois. Jim Tarmann: Well, the uniqueness of LaGrange back to your question about what it means to corn growers, if you look at the river miles between Peoria and LaGrange versus Lock 25 and then 24, we'll see a bigger impact right away. That's why LaGrange is so key to specifically Illinois, if I can and be selfish. But 25 was targeted because of political reasons of Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois working, it benefited all three of them. So it was kind of to get the ball rolling. But now at least from an Illinois perspective, you're going to see us really advocating for LaGrange being selfish. Tracy Zea: And Jon, you've been in D.C. long enough. Community project funding, AKA earmarks is back and in fiscal year '22, NESP received 45 million for an earmark, which isn't a large number, but it was large. They're testing the water with earmarks. So ways listeners can help move the ball forward is fiscal year '23 appropriations. We're looking for an earmark for LaGrange Lock and Dam. And that will be our number one push as Jim simply stated. Jon Doggett: One other topic I want to touch on, and you mentioned it briefly, and that is the unique coalition that was put together. And I've worn a little shoe leather out on this issue. When you walk into a congressional office with a bunch of farmers and a bunch of union guys, they kind of wonder, did both of our appointments show up at the same time? So tell us about that. And also you have some folks in the environmental community that have been particularly helpful. Tracy Zea: Yeah. You're absolutely right, Jon. People are confused when you go around and do introductions and you have an operator, an agriculture farmer and a skilled building trade member. It's a great coalition though. Locks and dams is a bipartisan issue. If you look at the NESP work plan letter to get infrastructure funding, there's over 70 senators and members of Congress that signed that, and that would not have been done without the grassroots from agriculture communities such as the corn farmers, as well as the skilled building trades. Both are very active politically, and it really helps to benefit the locks and dam system. Jon Doggett: Well, certainly now is not the time to go ahead and restaurant any laurels. And I know you guys at Waterways Council are not doing that. And I certainly know that Jim Tarmann from Illinois Corn is not going to do that, but we still have work to do and advocacy that needs to be performed. Tracy Zea: Yes sir. The work has just begun. Jim Tarmann: Yeah. I don't anticipate the other six being any easier than the first one we got done, but- Dusty Weis: Hopefully it doesn't take another 30 years. Jim Tarmann: I hope not. I mean, all indications as Tracy said, is the appropriations that hopefully, the Sentinel will pass the 45 million for LaGrange. Tracy Zea: They did last night. Jim Tarmann: They did last night? Okay. We're still moving in the right direction, but not going to take our foot off the accelerator. Tracy Zea: When you get some momentum in D.C. as you know Jon, you got to double down and ride the hot streak while you can and drive it like you stole it, run it until the wheels go off. So we're going to go all in until they tell to stop. Jon Doggett: There is an [inaudible 00:24:48] and when you're on the right side of that, you need to stay on the right side of that. Yeah, absolutely. Well, Tracy Zea from the Inland Waterways Council and Jim Tarmann from the Illinois Corn Growers. Thank you so much for being with us today. This has been great. The Upper Mississippi River system is a vital way to import and export goods. And if the U.S. is going to truly be competitive in the global marketplace, that system absolutely has to be reliable. And that wouldn't be possible without great advocates like the two of you and countless thousands of others who have advocated for this very important and very vital systems. So thank you again. I'm Jon Doggett, I'm the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association, and we hope you'll join us again soon for the next episode of Wherever Jon May Roam, The National Corn Growers Association Podcast. Dusty Weis: That is going to wrap up this edition of Wherever Jon May Roam, The National Corn Growers Association Podcast. New episodes arrive monthly so make sure you subscribe in your favorite app and join us again soon. Visit ncga.com to learn more or sign up for the Association's email newsletter.

    "content": "Nearly 90 members of Congress sent a letter recently to the U.S. International Trade Commission calling on it to reconsider the tariffs placed on phosphate fertilizer products imported from Morocco and suspend the current process to impose new duties on nitrate fertilizers from Trinidad and Tobago. The effort was spearheaded by Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Rep. Tracey Mann and Rep. Cindy Axne (D-Iowa). “We are deeply appreciative of these leaders for their efforts to protect farmers who have felt the crippling effects of high fertilizer prices and shortages,” said Iowa farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Chris Edgington. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will no doubt worsen these problems.” Alluding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and many of the supply-side issues plaguing the country, the letter noted that conditions surrounding on-farm expenses in the U.S. have dramatically changed since the ITC made its determinations and that tariffs are making a bad situation worse. “Since the U.S. Department of Commerce’s decision to impose duties on phosphate fertilizer imports from Morocco, phosphate fertilizer prices have increased 93%,” the letter noted. The letter said that eliminating the duties on fertilizer imports provides the most immediate opportunity for a near-term, partial remedy to the high costs of fertilizer facing U.S. farmers before the end of the 2022 planting season.",

    "title": "Corn Growers Call on the Biden Administration to Use Emergency Authority to Maintain Consumer Access to Lower-Cost Fuel",
    "content": "Corn grower leaders from 19 states sent an open letter to President Biden today calling on him to use the administration’s existing emergency authorities to tap more homegrown renewable fuels, like ethanol, to help stabilize energy markets and lower the price of fuel for consumers. The letter comes as Russia’s attack on Ukraine has impacted energy markets, increasing oil and gas prices. The letter called on the president to prevent consumers from losing the choice of E15, often marketed as Unleaded 88, a higher ethanol blend that costs less and reduces emissions. A 2021 court decision resulting from oil industry efforts to limit the growth of higher ethanol blends reversed year-round market access for E15, beginning this summer, absent action from the Biden administration or Congress. “We urge your administration to act to prevent consumers from losing access to a lower-cost fuel option on June 1,” the letter read. “As gas prices have increased following the rise in oil prices, higher ethanol blends have provided drivers with savings, with ethanol priced an average of 78 cents less per gallon than unblended gasoline at wholesale during March.” The Biden administration has several tools to use, including acting under Section 211 of the Clean Air Act, having the EPA use its enforcement discretion or issuing an executive order. Increasing the use of lower-cost and lower-emission E15 could easily replace previous oil imports from Russia, according to the letter. “If we replaced just one-third of regular E10 fuel sales with E15, we would fully replace all gasoline from previously imported Russian oil,” the corn grower leaders said. “When it comes to cost, blending more ethanol, not less, is an immediate step to help lower fuel prices.” Farmers can quickly help policymakers bring down the fuel prices, the letter noted. “American farmers stand at the ready to help lower costs at the pump, decarbonize liquid fuels, support domestic manufacturing jobs and revitalize the U.S. economy with clean energy, all while continuing to meet demands for food, feed and exports, due to our increased productivity and sustainability,” said the farmer leaders. In addition to emergency action from the Biden administration, NCGA is also asking Congress to advance legislation to ensure continued access to E15 to lower fuel prices and work on policy, such as the Next Generation Fuels Act, which will provide a permanent pathway to higher ethanol blends. Farmers are encouraged to contact their Members of Congress to urge their support for E15 market access and higher ethanol blends through the NCGA Action Center.",

    "title": "Up to Bat at Classic: Nourish the Futures Teacher Leaders",
    "content": "Did you know that only 4% of students take agriculture science? It is the primary goal of Nourish the Future (NTF)—a national education initiative developed by science teachers for science teachers—to have ag science taught in every biology classroom across America. During 2022’s Commodity Classic in New Orleans, NTF came out swinging with a heavy-hitting agenda to help meet that goal. Not only did the STEM-based initiative lead a dynamic three-day Teacher Leader Community (TLC) conference where they introduced ag-based science curriculum and peer-networking, but additionally, participants stepped downstairs to the trade show floor and interacted with growers from around the country. On the first day of the trade show, NTF knocked it out of the park with an expert panel discussion that was moderated by Dale Minyo, general manager for Ag New Communications and broadcaster for Ohio Ag Net. The discussion centered around the importance and impact of NTF’s curriculum and outreach on both teachers and their students. The batting list of panelists included: Dana Allen-Tully, vice-chair of NCGA Substantiable Ag Research Action Team (SARAT) Koleson McCoy, former National FFA president and student at the Ohio State University Christine Girtain, a teacher at Toms River High School South and North Bernadette Harwood, grower and Ag in the Classroom educator at Cornell Cooperative Extension in Mt. Morris, New York Tom Fontana, director of Research and Education at the Ohio Soybean Council “Our Sustainable Ag Research Action Team understands this imperative need to get agriculture integrated into the curricula of mainstream science classrooms,” said Dana Allen-Tully, who is also a Minnesota dairy farmer and corn grower. “Helping bridge the gap between teachers, students and farmers is paramount in the present to help draw the best and brightest candidates into ag careers that will propel our industry in the future.” NTF rounded out their Commodity Classic series on Saturday with a leadership session and curriculum work. The team of twenty teachers worked on creating new curriculum to supplement the lessons found on the NTF website. “Thank you so very much for this amazing opportunity to see and talk to people in the ag industry from all across the nation! It was heart-warming and reassuring that so many people in the industry were excited and optimistic about a group of teachers attending the conference,” said Ohio teacher Cait Maloy. “It was an inspiring opportunity and reinvigorated my passion for teaching, especially with the knowledge I gained that I can take back to the classroom.” Nourish the Future is made possible through the assistance of the National Corn Growers Association, the nation’s corn farmers and their state corn checkoff programs.

    "content": "The nation’s capital looked a lot like rural America this week as farmers, organizations, and companies representing and serving farmers took to the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to celebrate National Ag Day. “National Ag Day provides farmers with an opportunity to raise some of our key issues with policymakers and their staff in a fun and engaging way,” said Iowa farmer and National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) President Chris Edgington. “The event attracts everyone from people strolling the Mall to senators and leaders at USDA.” Staff standing at the NCGA booth stayed busy talking with visitors. At one point, NCGA staff spoke with Robert Bonnie, USDA undersecretary for farm production and conservation, while curious tourists looked on and joggers breezed by. Congressional staff also walked over to the booth as U.S. senators spoke at various events and moved quickly to greet people at various places on the mall. Farm equipment was placed strategically across the mall with people gathering around a John Deere combine with a backdrop of the Washington Monument, a tribute to a man who was no stranger to farm life. “We meet with officials all the time here in Washington,” said Edgington. “But this event allows us to really share our story in a way that brings our issues to life with these folks.” National Ag Day, sponsored by the Ag Council of America, has been held in the nation’s capital for 49 years.",

    "title": "Wrong Again: Its Time to Get the Facts Straight on Corn Production and Ethanol",
    "content": "I’ve been farming for a long time, so I’ve heard all the arguments about corn and ethanol – and they’re always wrong. The Washington Post Editorial Board suggested waiving the renewable fuel standard would help address outcomes of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Instead, the Washington Post should be crediting farmers’ increased productivity and efficiency, resulting in higher yields using fewer resources, meeting food and fuel needs to keep prices down. What’s happening in the world today is disheartening. I recognize how fortunate we are to live in this country where we will plant crops this spring without a war coming through our fields. Corn farmers’ yields are up more than 25 bushels per acre since 2007 on a similar acreage footprint, and we are here to answer the call and help feed and fuel the world. For the current 2021-22 corn marketing year, USDA estimates corn ending stocks at 1.5 billion bushels. We carried out 1.2 billion bushels in the 2020-21 marketing year. For this planting season, USDA projects 92 million planted acres with a yield of 181 bushels per acre. If projections are met, total production would reach a record 15.2 billion bushels, driving ending stocks up to nearly 2 billion bushels. The corn kernel is versatile. A kernel’s starch is fermented to make ethanol with no impact on the valuable protein, nutrients, and fiber that are used in efficient ethanol co-products such as animal feeds and oils. As a result, producing ethanol fuel from corn has no effect on the supply of food nutrients from corn, but it does expand our fuel supply and lower fuel prices. Come on out to my farm. I will show you today’s corn production and how each kernel of corn delivers multiple uses, including food, feed and cleaner, less expensive fuel.",

    "content": "Let’s talk environmental equations! March 14th’s National Butterfly Day plus March 20th’s first day of Spring . . . equals the perfect calendar calculation for planning a new pollinator habitat! Pollinator health is one of the leading sustainability issues in twenty-first-century agriculture. As public interest in pollinator health continues to increase, stakeholders in this discussion – our members and producers nationwide – have a critical role to play for implementation. Therefore, NCGA has partnered with Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever – the nation’s leading charities for upland wildlife habitat conservation – to provide our members with direct complimentary conservation planning services for pollinator habitat outcomes in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. In addition, NCGA proudly supports pollinator health awareness through initiatives like the Bee and Butterfly Habitat Fund, the Honeybee Health Coalition and Farmers for Monarchs. These programs offer online tools, educational resources and best management practices to help support pollinator habitats. By incorporating pollinator forage and creating a pollinator-friendly landscape in tandem with their croplands, growers can protect soil health, improve water quality by controlling runoff and sediment and capture carbon in the environment. The next step in a good stewardship plan is using pollinator-friendly pest management practices. Programs like BeSure! from Growing Matters provide free guides and other resources to optimize the use of pesticide products to protect both crops and nearby pollinators. The objective is to reinforce practical stewardship practices that protect pollinators and other wildlife when handling, planting and disposing of treated seeds, as well as from other neonic applications used throughout the growing season, including a broad range of crops, turf, ornamental plants and trees.

Plus, we finally settle, once and for all, who’s the biggest music buff—Chip Flory or NCGA CEO Jon Doggett—with a classic rock trivia contest for the ages. DIRECT SHARE Transcript Chip Flory: We went from one day being an operating family farm, a farm that I saw my future on, and the next morning when the bank president called and said, \"We've got to have a conversation because things have changed.\" To being in a position that I felt like I could help farmers make better business decisions, that was really appealing to me. Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association Podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host association, CEO, Jon Doggett. From the fields of the corn belt to the DC beltway, we're making sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: Chip Flory is sometimes called the voice of rural America, host of the AgriTalk radio program and podcast, he brings ag news, policy updates and expert insights to a network of more than 135 radio stations across the US. In this episode, we flipped the script on Chip, interviewing him at the National Corn Growers Association booth on the show floor at Commodity Classic. Plus, we finally settle once and for all who is the biggest music buff, Chip Flory or NCGA CEO, Jon Doggett. Dusty Weis: If you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app also make sure you follow the NCGA on twitter @nationalcorn and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. With that, it's time to once again, introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association and Jon, they say turnabout is fair play, over the years, there's a fellow who's regularly called upon you, picked your brain, raked you over the coals with tough questions on his AgriTalk program and his name's Chip Flory. Jon Doggett: His name is Chip Flory. He is a good friend. He is an outstanding ag reporter and I have been on your show, what, a couple dozen times? Chip Flory: Oh a couple. Yeah, at least a couple dozen times. Jon Doggett: We talked about let's do a podcast at Classic and we kicked ideas around and I said, \"Let's get Flory on the program.\" I am so glad you're here. I have just thoroughly enjoyed being on your show over and over again. I am just tickled to death that you're on mine. Chip Flory: I think I'm glad I'm here. I think we'll figure this out as we go. I'm not exactly sure, it's been a long time since I've spent this much time on this side of the mic. I don't know how this is going to go. Jon Doggett: Are you at such an age now that you can't go ahead and deal with change? Chip Flory: No, I'm not going to say that. Dusty Weis: Says the guy who didn't want to use a different set of headphones than he's used to. Chip Flory: No, thank you. Thank you so much for asking. Jon Doggett: Chip, we're just going to start. Who do you work for? What do you do? Why are you here? Chip Flory: I'm the host of AgriTalk. AgriTalk in its original format has been around for more than 25 years. Ken Root was the first host of AgriTalk, Ken and I are good friends today. Mike Adams was after Ken and I took over for Mike four years ago on the morning show. The afternoon show, the second hour of AgriTalk is something that I really am proud of and I'm proud of the morning show, don't get me wrong, I love doing it. Chip Flory: The afternoon show with its focus on markets, it's something that we started from scratch. Now, the fine people at Farm Journal with their network that was already in place for AgriTalk, gave us a great platform to go out and build a new show from. To go to market with a brand new, one hour ag based show that starts at 2:00 in the afternoon, that was a stretch, it was a stretch for a lot of stations. Chip Flory: Now it's on 135 stations in 19 states. I'm really, really proud of the afternoon show and the market side of things that we cover in the afternoon. I was Pro Farmer editor for 25 years, we talked markets, we talked policy, we talked issues, but the number one thing that we talked about is markets and what to do to manage the risk that you face on a regular basis. To turn what I did for 25 years into a show that people really seem to respond to, that's pretty rewarding. Jon Doggett: You have a lot of reason to be proud of that, my friend, you absolutely do. Tell me a little more about your background. Where were you born and raised? How did you get to here? Chip Flory: I grew up on a farm in Eastern Iowa, it was a very diverse family farm that went through what farms went through in the late seventies and early eighties. I was 15 years old when we had the farm sale in 1980 and my brother's 10 years older than I am, he and my dad had gotten into a position that the bank said was a bad spot to be in. I was only 15, but I was old enough to know what was going on, but I know that the payments were still being made. I know that everything was being hit, I know that the operation was running as it was supposed to run, it's just that once the rules changed, the rules changed and there was no fighting it. Chip Flory: We went from one day being an operating family farm, a farm that I saw my future on, I expected and was planning to be another farmer on that home place. The next morning, when the bank president called and said, \"We've got to have a conversation because things have changed.\" That was a trying time for our family. I've got an appreciation for farming and farmers and for the trials and the tribulations and the risks that they face and to be in a position that I felt like I could help farmers manage those risks, help farmers make better business decisions, that was really appealing to me. Chip Flory: It was 1981, I was a sophomore in high school, we were driving down the road, dad and I were, and dad was still farming, even after the farm sale. We were driving down the road and on the radio came on the Pro Farmer Minute, it was a short little, one minute hit with an idea that would be in there, maybe a hint at how you should go about your risk management. Dad stopped the truck, turned around, we went back to the house and he says, \"I got to take care of this now. I got to do something about it.\" By the way, you know who was reporting that Pro Farmer Minute at that time? Jon Doggett: Who? Chip Flory: Ron Michaelson, the father of one Davis Michaelson. Jon Doggett: That's going back a long time ago. Chip Flory: Yes, that was 1981. That had such an impact on me, that the one minute that dad heard caused him to turn the truck around and go home and take some action, that left an impression on me, it really did. My mom was a journalist for 60 years, she was a real correspondent. I had the reporting blood in me. I had the love of agriculture. I had the influence from my dad, and then I saw a Pro Farmer in action and it was just something that I decided that I wanted to do. I decided at that time, before I graduated high school, I decided that I wanted to be the editor of Pro Farmer someday. Jon Doggett: You were looking for a career rather than a job? Chip Flory: Oh, absolutely. Jon Doggett: And a mission to boot. Chip Flory: Absolutely. I was very active in 4-H, Jon, and the whole goal-driven decision making and the setting of goals and following through and writing out goals, I bought into that stuff, hook, line and sinker. I applied the lessons that I was learning from 4-H, I took it right over to my life and my career. I knew if it was possible, I wanted to do one job interview in my life and that was it. Jon Doggett: Those stories, in particular, those of us who were in agriculture in the eighties and I remember vividly my wife and I, shortly after we were married in 1980, going back to the ranch was probably about '82, '83, having the conversation with the family. Chip Flory: Yeah. Jon Doggett: My brother was already back at the ranch and times were really tough, he'd just bought my uncle out a couple years before and he bought the place next door a few years after that. He just looked at me and said, \"I'd love to have you come back, but here's the economic reality.\" That has stuck with me for the rest of my life and it has driven a lot of what I have done throughout my career as well. Those moments that you all of a sudden realize that this is something, it's something you need to act on. Chip Flory: Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly right. When dad wrapped up in the house, whatever it was that he did, I don't remember all the details of it, but whatever it was that Ron Michaelson caused dad to stop and go back and do, it spurred up the most heartfelt conversation between a dad and a 16 year old that it could have ever spurred. It was the conversation of the economic reality of a 200 acre farm in 1981. Jon Doggett: Yeah. Chip Flory: For mom and dad, it might work. For mom and dad and the next generation, that's not going to work. Jon Doggett: Everybody's going to have to work in town. Chip Flory: Right. Jon Doggett: Then what? You went to Iowa state? Chip Flory: Right. I was a little slow in making decisions, I'll admit that, in high school. Like I said, I was very active in 4-H and it was almost like I didn't want that to end, I might have hung on just a little bit too long. I enrolled at Iowa State University a little late, was trying to figure out exactly how I wanted to do and what it should look like. Here I am, a senior in high school, I call up Cedar Falls, Iowa, and the Pro Farmer headquarters, and just asked to talk to an editor and they put Bob Kaufman on the line with me. Chip Flory: I explained to him who I was and that I'd been reading Pro Farmer for a couple of years and I'm a big fan of the Pro Farmer Minute, love the impact and love the information and the guidance, the influence that comes from Pro Farmer. I very bluntly said, \"Bob, what do I got to do if I want to be the editor or Pro Farmer someday? What do I take at Iowa state?\" Jon Doggett: A rather audacious question as a senior in high school. Dusty Weis: Can I have your job? Jon Doggett: Yeah. Chip Flory: Yeah. What if I want your job someday? We made a plan. We made a plan on the phone that day. Bob helped me make that plan. I wrote it all down, I took it with me to Iowa State, Vero Fritz was my advisor at Iowa State in the journalism department. I put that piece of paper in front of him and he says, \"Ah, I don't know. The top part here we can handle. I don't know about this bottom part, if we can handle that or not.\" Chip Flory: I said, \"Oh, well, that's disappointing.\" He says, \"Well, we can't handle it right now. Let's get it figured out.\" We got Rob Dieter from the ag economics department and we got Paul Lasley from the sociology department, just one of the great minds in rural sociology, Paul Lasley and Rob Dieter was a heck of a teacher too, my favorite. They got together and put together a program, a minor for me that was ag socioeconomics, how money affects the decision-making process, they put that program together for me. I went through, got a degree in ag journalism with a broadcast emphasis and a minor in ag socioeconomics. Jon Doggett: Ag socioeconomics. Chip Flory: Yep. Jon Doggett: That's a mouthful. Chip Flory: Yes. Yeah, absolutely, it is. Then you won't believe who called finals week. Jon Doggett: Who? Chip Flory: Bob Kaufman. He said, \"Chip, I just wanted to check up on you and see how things are going.\" I said, \"Bob, your timing is absolutely unbelievable to me. I've got one final left.\" And he says, \"We don't have a job open here, but let's keep in contact.\" Next day, sitting in the apartment, the phone rings again and it was a guy by the name of Jeff Wilson, who was the bureau chief for Commodity World News, which became Futures World News. It was a wire service owned by Austar Communications, which also owned Pro Farmer and it was a job reporting from the Chicago Board of Trade, reporting on what's happening in the grain markets. I looked at it as my foot in the door to eventually get to Pro Farmer. Chip Flory: I had never expected to get the experience that I got spending three and a half years on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade, floor of the Mercantile Exchange and the way that the commodity markets and risk management and how the markets flow together, how that bit me, I never expected that to happen. I just thought I'm getting my foot in the door, I'm going to live in Chicago only for as long as I have to and then I'm getting out of there. I'll admit three and a half years in Chicago for this kid was enough, but boy, I tell you what, that's three and a half years that I would never give up there. Jon Doggett: Drinking from the fire hose? Chip Flory: No, man. Jon Doggett: Yeah. Chip Flory: Yeah. Jon Doggett: Yeah and getting opportunity to make all sorts of mistakes and learning from them. Boy, that has to have been just super. Chip Flory: Oh, it was fantastic. Dusty Weis: You talked too about how 4-H influenced you and certainly one of the things that they teach you in 4-H is entrepreneurialism and when you talk about approaching your advisors at Iowa State and saying, \"Hey, I want you to build a minor for me.\" That's an entrepreneurial spirit right there, but you went on, you guys have built a network of what did you say? 135 affiliates now. Chip Flory: Yeah. Dusty Weis: Going into the journalism world and making it there, not a whole lot easier than farming certainly. To go in and succeed the way that you have and to build out a network of 135 affiliates around the country, that takes a lot of entrepreneurialism too. Chip Flory: And a heck of a team, an unbelievable team in doing that. Brian Conradi at Farm Journal at broadcast head quarters in South Bend, Indiana, he leads an awesome team. I got so much support from Clinton Griffith Ag Day anchor from Time Morgan, the host of U.S. Farm Report on the broadcast team. I'm the young guy because they've been around at Farm Journal longer than I have. Chip Flory: That's really interesting, but coming off of 17 years as editor of Pro Farmer, which I will still contend is the coolest gig ever. I love, love, love what I'm doing, but that time that I spent as editor or Pro Farmer and for the first, I don't know, 10 years, some of it might've been, \"Oh my gosh, I can't believe that I'm actually doing this.\" The opportunities that I had as Pro Farmer editor, get out on the road, talk to people, talk to that guy that's walking by over there right now, Keith Hora. One of my absolute favorites gave me my first break as Pro Farmer editor on a big story, that guy that just walked by. Jon Doggett: A great guy too. Chip Flory: Absolutely. Jon Doggett: Absolutely. . Chip Flory: Yes. But the Pro Farmer editor, it's not just being the editor, it is a responsibility to the membership of Professional Farmers of America. Boy, I took that serious and the thing is over the years, the people that I worked with at Pro Farmer, I still work with Jim Weisemeyer. Jim Weisemeyer's the Pro Farmer policy analyst, he's the Washington guy, didn't ever want to be the editor, but a guy that I worked with at Iowa State, a guy that I hired to work with me in Chicago when I was the bureau chief in Chicago, for a period of time. Chip Flory: Scott Davis, he worked with him up until it was the early 2000's, but I was in his way, that guy was going to be Pro Farmer editor. I was in his way and I was trying to figure out what it in the world can I do to give him the sense of responsibility, sense of urgency, the sense of ownership that you get when you are the editor of that newsletter. We succeeded on that for several years, but he wanted it as bad as I did and I was in the way, he's now an unbelievably successful risk manager broker up in Rochester. He was one of the guys that I just loved working with Scott. Chip Flory: The other guy's, Brian Grady, good Lord, I was definitely in his way and it was starting to become very much apparent and he had ambitions to be the editor, I wanted him to be the editor and then when the opportunity came along to do the afternoon show, get that up and running, get that started. Later the opportunity to add the morning hour, that was plenty of incentive and is still crazy rewarding enough to make the move and I'll say it, to give up the coolest gig there is in ag journalism. Jon Doggett: I feel a little bit the same way about, I love being the CEO of the Corn Guards, but you know what, running that Washington office, that was the neatest thing I've ever done in my life. Of course we had some wins and that was great, it's the steps along the way, it's the people along the way. I've had some wonder or mentors throughout my time, Dale Moore, who just announced his retirement yesterday. Chip Flory: Yes. Jon Doggett: Yeah. In 1988, I moved out to Washington, DC in February and the chief of staff said, \"The Congressman Marlon and Congressman Roberts, they're good buds and he's got a guy who's really good on ag stuff, a young guy by the name of Dale Moore, you need to go buy him a cup of coffee.\" I did, and I've been- Chip Flory: Holy smokes. Jon Doggett: I've been doing that ever since and people like Dick Newford at Farm Bureau and all those folks along the way, and it wasn't the guys that gave you the praise, it was the ones that said, \"Hey, listen you knucklehead, you ought to try something a little bit different.\" I see Dusty's nodding his head too. Dusty Weis: I've gotten that talk a few times over the years, I'll tell you that.Yeah, totally. Jon Doggett: I'll tell you, I'm looking over at Larry and he's going, \"Yeah, I'm the guy.\" Dusty Weis: Larry and I actually, we just found out a couple weeks ago, we lost a good mentor of ours. Larry and I, of course, Larry, our producer have known each other since we were students at a student radio station at the University of Wisconsin Madison and the general manager, Dave Black is a legend in his own time, passed away recently. Terrible, terrible news and our hearts gone to his family. Dusty Weis: It got me thinking about one of the best things that Dave Black ever did for me was when I was a sophomore in college and I had just joined up the radio station, I was kind of loosely involved, I was phoning it in, if I'm being honest, looking back at it. Then at the end of the semester, I went up to Dave Black, I asked him, \"Hey, Dave, you write me a letter of recommendations?\" He looks at me square in the eyes and goes, \"Nope.\" What do you mean? What do you mean nope? Dusty Weis: He looks at me and he says, \"I know that you are capable of contributing a lot more to our student radio station. I want to see you get involved and apply yourself and really show me what you've got and frankly, I need to get to know you better because a recommendation is a sacred thing to me. I don't know you well enough to recommend you to anybody. No, I won't write you a letter of recommendation today, that's not to say the door's not open in the future, but show me what you've got.\" Then a year later, when I came back to them after really putting my back into it for a year and asked him for a letter of recommendation, he was more than happy and signed it with a flourish and it felt all that better for having gotten it that way. Chip Flory: Yeah. You bet. Good stuff. That's a tough one to lose right there. Yeah. One of my mentors just recently passed too, Jerry Passer from WMT. I had the WMT scholarship, geez, I think it was 1986. I got to spend the summer with Jerry Passer and Rich Balvans and Jane in the farm department at WMT in Cedar Rapids, that was fun. Dusty Weis: Yeah. Certainly, hearing you tell these stories Chip about your time in the industry and agriculture's always been a really tight knit community, but particularly ag media, I think has always had those really deep roots and people that have long histories in this business. How would you say that the ag media landscape has changed in your time here? Chip Flory: Somehow, someway they're getting younger. Jon Doggett: I've noticed that as well. Chip Flory: Is it that I'm just getting old? I don't know. The way that it has changed is on the broadcast side, the people that are still in it can do so much with so little. They've gone through continuous budget cuts, they've gone through the tightening of the screws so many times and to see the job that they still do and the level of commitment, to see their dedication to their station, to their region, to their listeners just blows me away. Chip Flory: In so many ways. There are a one man shop, they have to prep the news, they have to deliver the news, then they might go out and cover high school sports that night. Then they have to go and talk with the people that are advertising on the station, then they got to deal with FCC over things. Chip Flory: I look at what those guys do and it just blows me away because I study the news. I study the markets. I spend time networking with the smartest people that I can find. I spend time preparing for conversations and somebody else is out there managing the affiliates and somebody else is out there making sales. I look at the team that I've got and it's awesome, but to see the level of commitment of the farm broadcasters that are working out there at an individual station, absolutely blows me away. I spent some time with some up-and-coming farm journalists from Iowa State here just recently, very encouraged there. I think we're going to be just fine, we've got good people, smart people that are coming into the industry, but the complexity of the issues that they're going to have to understand going forward, it just blows me away. Jon Doggett: It's so many things that we deal with more and more things, the difference between the policy resolutions that we talked about this morning with the corn guards, is much different than it was 20 years ago. Yeah. We still talk about farm programs, we still talk about ethanol. We still talk about ethanol. We still talk about ethanol, but we're talking about more and more things and we're here at the trade show. Let's just take a look around and take a look at all of the technology that's here and we all have to manage it, but boy. Chip Flory: Think of the choices that presents for someone that wants to get into farm journalism right now, if you want to specialize, that's one of the things that I decided very early on was that I was going to specialize in markets and analysis. I think that really benefited me throughout my career. If somebody new decides to focus on technology, they're going to be around for a long time. Jon Doggett: Focus on technology, but be able to explain it to people at my generation. Chip Flory: Yeah. Right. Jon Doggett: 66-year-olds don't understand technology nearly as well as my eight-year-old granddaughter. How do we take that? That's the thing I like about what you do and I feel every time I'm on your program, you invest the time to understand the issues, you invest the time and look at the facts, and then you have to turn around and take something that's quite complex and put it in a form that is short, sweet, concise, understandable. That's a talent. Chip Flory: Yeah. Believe me. There are many times where I think there's no way that we're going to be able to get all of this into a 10 minute conversation. When you think about lot of the formats that are out there, the interviews are two or three minutes. You know that, when you're on my show, sometimes I feel like there's a weight lifted off of you a bit because you've got a little bit more time, you can explain things a little bit further, we can have a little fun, joke around at the start of something. Chip Flory: When you get constrained to that two, two and a half minute, almost sound bite conversation, I understand that those types of interviews are very important, but I consider mine just a little bit longer format in these 10 minute conversations that we get to have. In the afternoon show, when we're talking markets, I have a single guest on for 20 minutes and that's because in 10 minutes you can't really get from them what they are thinking about the markets. Chip Flory: Now, when it comes time to talk about tariffs on fertilizer, something like that, we can get you on and in 10 minutes we get to the end of that and I feel like I understand exactly why the NCGA is pushing this as hard as they are. That's the kind of format of info that I enjoy delivering the most. Jon Doggett: That's why we're doing this podcast is because we have to have more conversations and fewer soundbites. Dusty Weis: Some things don't fit into 140 character tweet. Jon Doggett: Oddly enough, no. Chip Flory: Unbelievable, isn't it? Jon Doggett: Let's go into some other things. Julie, of course you know, Julie, she always has lots of questions and some of which you wrote down, some of which she giggled and laughed and told, me about. Craziest guess you've ever interviewed? Dusty Weis: You mean, besides Jon Doggett? Chip Flory: Jon's going to make that list. Jon Doggett: I'm not going to be at the top of the list though. Chip Flory: Okay. Jim Morrison. Dusty Weis: The Jim Morrison? Chip Flory: Not that Jim Morrison. No. Remember the movie, the Rookie? Jon Doggett: Yeah. Chip Flory: Okay. Yeah. The pitcher high school coach made his way through minor leagues and made his way to pitch for Texas. At the start of COVID, everybody was just like, \"How in the world are we going to get through this? I can't believe that we've been shut down.\" One night I was watching the Rookie and I texted my producer, Joe Stackler, I texted him immediately and said, \"Let's get this Jim Morrison on the show and let's find out what he's doing, see if we could get him on and talk about some motivational for us all.\" He was an absolute blast. We've had him on, I think three times and he's an absolute blast and he was a big shot of motivation, so that was fun. Chip Flory: The time that I was sitting, looking at my call screener screen and saw Oliver North on there. That was- Jon Doggett: I bet that was interesting. Chip Flory: That was a little intimidating to see that. That was after President Trump ordered the strike on one of the terrorists in the middle east and got him. Okay, I can't remember his name. I wondered exactly what it might mean for relations in the region. Who in the heck would we talk to about it? Just thought let's get the old Colonel on and he agreed to come on and talk about it. Dusty Weis: Sometimes you got to shoot your shot. Chip Flory: Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Oliver North, that was an interesting one and it still blows me away and it's gotten to the point that he's almost a regular on the show now and oh man, I'm going to really show how much of a geek I am here. Jared Bernstein, the White House council of economic advisors when Obama was president, Jared was on CNBC all the time as the economic spokesman for the Obama administration. Chip Flory: I can't tell you how many arguments I've had with Jared over the years. He never answered me once, I guess he couldn't hear me through the TV, but I would scream at the TV while he was on there and just dream of the day where I could have a conversation with this guy. He's now kind of a regular on the show and I ask him the questions that I would ask through the TV and he responds, and it is not confrontational at all. He knows that he is going to get, okay, we're going to talk about the jobs report, but then he's probably also going to bring up, I'm going to go to something else in the conversation. Chip Flory: The last jobs report that was on, of course, what we went to was when are we going to become energy independent again? When will we see the rules and regulations in this country promote fluid fuel use in this country and open it up? We get the prices at the pump down, he talked about energy independence comes in many different ways, you've got your solar, you've got your wind, you've got this, you've got that. Chip Flory: I said, Jared, \"That's not what we are talking about. We are talking about pumping more.\" He says, \"That message has been heard at the White House now.\" He said that last Friday, just this week, you can tell that message has been heard at the White House, that if they don't put more crude, more gasoline, more opportunity to blend some ethanol into the system, that if they thought they were going to get beat next November, they really think they're going to get beat next November now. Jon Doggett: Who is the most famous person that you ever interviewed? The one that you felt a little bit intimidated, oh my God, I can't believe that I'm actually talking to the Queen of England. You have not had Queen Elizabeth on your show. Chip Flory: I don't know what we'd talk about, honestly. Jon Doggett: Corgis. Chip Flory: Well, we could do that. They're cute little fellas. Gosh, when I was the editor of Pro Farmer, I was really, really hard on Tom Vilsack 1.0 under Obama, especially in his first two years, because he was not focused on commercial agriculture. He was not focused on the people that feed the world, he was focused on farmer's markets, which is fine, but that's not the responsibility of the secretary of agriculture. By the time he wrapped up his first eight years, I was a fan of his attention to commercial and production agriculture, now that we're onto Vilsack 2.0, I get an opportunity to talk with him on a regular basis. That's pretty cool. Jon Doggett: He's a lot more accessible now than he was those first couple years, it was just horrible. Now if you really need to talk to the secretary, you can get on the phone with the secretary if you really need to and he will give you the attention. Chip Flory: Yeah, exactly. Senator Chuck Grassley is unbelievably generous with his time on the show. He's on roughly every six weeks, five, six weeks, that's a pretty famous guy. If it wouldn't have been for the fact that I worked 15 miles from his place and he was a Pro Farmer member, every now and then he would stop in the office anyway. If it wasn't for that, I'd probably be really intimidated every time I got on the phone with him, but seeing we had an acquaintance before, it's really cool to get him on and talk with him. He's so influential. Jon Doggett: Who is the guest that you wish you could have? Your dream guest that you have not been able to get yet and might not be able to? Chip Flory: Okay. Everything stays real upfront and current with me on stuff like that, you know who I can't get? Jon Doggett: Who? Chip Flory: It's somebody that called you the day that he got the dang job. I cannot get Michael Reagan, EPA administrator. Like I said, it's not like that's somebody that have been chasing for 10 years or anything like that. I don't think there's really anybody that have been chasing for 10 years to get them on the show, but that guy right now, or that person right now is Reagan, the request goes in every week. Jon Doggett: Yeah. We've had a request in to meet with the administrator since I think two days after he became confirmed and we have yet to have the courtesy of a reply. Maybe when this podcast goes out, maybe somebody at EPA, I don't know if they'll be listening to this, but we can hope. Dusty Weis: We can send it to him. Chip Flory: Yeah. We can send it to him. Exactly. At least this little clip. Dusty Weis: From new Orleans with love. Yeah. Chip Flory: I bet he'd do it. Jon Doggett: Chip, we talk in commodity organizations all the time, got to get our voice out, got to get our message out, got to inform people. What can commodity groups do better in your mind to talk to two audiences, one, the audience that you speak to everyday, farmers and people involved in agriculture. What can we do better in your mind to get our message out to a broader audience, consumers or influencers or whoever? Chip Flory: I'm of that age now, where I've seen things change and I'm prone to get tied into things, into how I think things should be done. For the first, I don't know, three years, four years, when a younger listener would come up to me and say, \"Chip, I listen to your podcast all the time. I love it.\" Thanks. But it's not really a podcast, it's a radio show and like, \"What?\" I said, \"Well, it's a radio program that just happens to also be a podcast.\" Chip Flory: I stopped fighting that and started embracing that and the change that it made when I was doing it radio-minded first, in the publishing, journalism media business, we have this digital-first attitude. Let's make sure that we get a good story out there as fast as we can and if it comes back later in print, that's fine, but it's digital-first. Chip Flory: I was always radio first. To me, based on the training that I had and the attitude that I had, the radio first took a little bit of a different attitude then podcast first. When I just kind of thought, I'm going to have this conversation with Joe, I'm going to have this conversation with Davis Michaelson, my news anchor about this subtle change, maybe we think podcast first, radio second. We did that and all of a sudden, the tone, the tempo of the conversation, everything just kind of changed, picked up, got even more casual than what it was when we were thinking radio first. Chip Flory: The response on radio has been fantastic, now the older listeners that before were always very encouraging about what we were doing on the show are even more encouraging now. They still come up and say, \"Hey, I listen to you on the radio, love your show, love the way that you and Davis... Love this, love that. Information's great.\" We've kind of taken on an attitude that we're really Sports Talk radio for farmers, which is really weird because I don't think Davis has ever listened to a day of Sports Talk in his life. Chip Flory: Just the simple fact that we take what we do seriously, we know that what we are reporting and conversing on is very important to those people that are listening because so many of them have chosen to listen. It's not that they just jumped in the truck and the show was on and they're listening, these people have chosen to listen by going and actively seeking out the information. If there is a way that you can discover to make your communications, make the membership, seek it out because it's so dang good and so dang important that they come to you and grab it, boy, then you got it. Jon Doggett: Neil Caskey my VP of comms is standing right over there and he and I are going to have this conversation as soon as we get done recording here, but you're absolutely right. Chip Flory: Yeah. Now I love it just because of my change in attitude. Now I love it when somebody comes up and says, \"Man, I love your podcast.\" I love it. It's because you realize, those people actively went after it, grabbed it and spent an hour listening to it. It blows me away, get them to come get it. Jon Doggett: Yeah. That puts a lot of responsibility on you to deliver. Chip Flory: Yeah. You can make a misstep once or twice. No, you know what? I do 40 segments a week in radio, if one of them is a bummer and I just go, \"Geeze then.\" Davis is like, \"Well, that one's kind of okay, but eh, let's not do that again.\" We can kind of laugh that off. If it happens a second time in a week, then it's the, \"Let's straighten up here, guys. We're doing something wrong.\" One time out of 40, let's not let that happen again. Two out of 40 it's time to reevaluate, commitment to quality and a respect of the time of the people that are consuming the information. Jon Doggett: You certainly have done that as a listener as well as a guest on your program. I greatly value it and currently value- Chip Flory: Thank you. Jon Doggett: What you do and what you do for our industry and you keep us on our toes occasionally. Chip Flory: I try to. Jon Doggett: I know you do. Chip Flory: If it's going to be something really big I'll call and let you know first. Yeah. Dusty Weis: Maybe. Fellas, anyone who listens to Jon's appearances on Chip's show regularly knows that you're both pretty big music buffs. Chip Flory: Sure. Dusty Weis: I think that's safe to say. In fact, I think that a lot of thought goes into careful selection of whatever the bumper music is. Jon Doggett: No, there's no thought going into that. Dusty Weis: Leading Jon Doggett, but that much said a little bird suggested to me that it might be fun to settle once and for all who's the king cheese around here in terms of music trivia. If you're amenable, I've got a little trivia game set up here, some classic rock, some sixties, seventies, eighties, rock and roll. Chip Flory: I hope you made the crown in his head size, not mine. Jon Doggett: Seven and five eights. Dusty Weis: Little rock paper scissors to see who leads off. I see Jon Doggett. Chip Flory: Yeah. He had scissors. I had paper. Dusty Weis: Jon, that's going to give you the option. Do you want to go first or second? Jon Doggett: I'll go first. Dusty Weis: All right, there we go. First category backing bands. I'm going to rattle off a solo musician, you've got five seconds to tell me the name of their most well-known backing band according to Google auto complete. The answer's going to be in the form of artist and so-and-so. For example, Paul McCartney and wings. We all ready? Jon Doggett: Yeah. Dusty Weis: All right. Coming to Jon Doggett first, Tom Petty? Jon Doggett: And the Heartbreakers. Dusty Weis: Chip, Joan Jett? Chip Flory: And the Black Hearts. Dusty Weis: That's right. Jon, Bob Seger? Chip Flory: Oh. Dusty Weis: 5, 4, 3, 2. Jon Doggett: Oh, I'm going to be really- Dusty Weis: And the Silver Bullet Band. Jon Doggett: Yeah. Yeah. You know who used to play on that was where a couple members of the Eagles. Dusty Weis: I did not know that. Jon Doggett: Yes. Dusty Weis: Yeah. Okay. Jon Doggett: Yeah. Dusty Weis: Chip, George Thorogood? Chip Flory: Is it Destroyers? Dusty Weis: Destroyers. He's got it. Very good. Here we go for a one-point lead. Jon Doggett, Elvis Castello? Jon Doggett: Oh, I was never an Elvis Castello fan. Ever. Ever. No, I'm not even going to try. Dusty Weis: That's all right. These get harder as they go along. Chip Flory: Oh, good. Dusty Weis: Chip, Iggy Pop? Chip Flory: No. Dusty Weis: And the Stooges. Chip Flory: No, I should've known that one. Woo. Dusty Weis: There we go. After round one, Chip's got a two-to-one lead. Coming into the second category, we're doing numbers here. I'm going to ask a question, you're going to give me the answer. It is a number and Jon, we'll start with you again. Jim Morrison, Janice Joplin, Jimmy Hendricks, Kirk Cobain all died tragically young, and they were all what age? Jon Doggett: 27. Dusty Weis: That's correct. Chip Flory: Wow. Dusty Weis: Point for Jon. They call it the 27 Club. Chip, the title of a 1966 hit by the Rolling Stones is all about having a whole lot of nervous breakdowns. How many? Chip Flory: I'm not going to get it. You got it? Dusty Weis: Jon Doggett to steal. Jon Doggett: Oh. How many? Dusty Weis: 19th. My 19th. Chip Flory: My 19th. Dusty Weis: Nervous breakdown. Chip Flory: Okay. Dusty Weis: Back to Jon Doggett. This revered Prague rock album by Rush is named after year in the future in which the album story is set. Which year is that? Jon Doggett: Not a big Rush fan either, but I think I can see the album cover, but I cannot see the title. Dusty Weis: Not a big fan of, We Are the Priests to the Temple of Syrinx? Come on. Jon Doggett: Hey, Dusty. I hate to break this to you, but I'm a little older than that. A little bit. Dusty Weis: 2112. Jon Doggett: 2112. Dusty Weis: Is the name of the album. Jon Doggett: All right. Chip Flory: Man, wouldn't it be something if we all get there? Jon Doggett: Yeah. Woo. Dusty Weis: Closer every day. Chip, Freddy Mercury lead singer of Queen attributed his extraordinary vocal range to having been born with an extra large mouth. How many extra teeth did he have? Chip Flory: Four. Dusty Weis: That is correct. Chip's back on the board. Jon Doggett: That was great. That was good. I'm impressed. Dusty Weis: Jon Doggett. Chip Flory: I saw the movie. Dusty Weis: It was a good flick. Yeah. Jon Doggett, Pink Floyd dropped their perennial classic Dark Side of the Moon in this year. Jon Doggett: 1972. Dusty Weis: Missed it by that much. '73. Chip Flory: That's the year Pro Farmer started. Jon Doggett: Dark Side of the Moon is probably one of the quintessential rock albums of all time and it is one of my favorite. In fact, I was on a plane here a couple nights ago and I had it cranked all the way up on the headphones and I was just really enjoying, it is just a great- Chip Flory: See, I enjoyed it until September of 1991 and I went on a 20-hour drive with a guy and that was all he played. Dusty Weis: Shoot. That'll wear you out on anything. Chip, similar question for you. Led Zeppelin four, it's got Stairway, When the Levee Breaks, Rock and Roll, Battle of Evermore, which year did that one come out? Chip Flory: Well, it would've been close to the same time. I'm going to go with his original answer, 1972. Dusty Weis: Missed it bye one, 1971. Jon Doggett: I was signaling too and I thought it was '72. Dusty Weis: All right. We got a good game here going so far. Chip's got three- Chip Flory: No, no. It would be a game if there were more correct answers than- Dusty Weis: I told you it was going to be hard. That's all right. I expect you guys to slam dunk this one because the third category here is lyrics. I'm going to start a lyrical phrase, you finish it. For a bonus point name the artist and song name. Going to Jon Doggett first, big wheels keep on turning. Jon Doggett: Proud Mary keeps on run... It's Proud Mary and its Creedence Clearwater Revival. Dusty Weis: I was actually going for Leonard Skynard and Sweet Home Alabama, but I actually think that lyrical phrase is in both of those songs. Jon Doggett: I think it is too. Dusty Weis: I think that's two points for Jon Doggett, Chip looks like he wants to work the rest- Chip Flory: Proud Mary keep on burning in. Rolling. Rolling. Rolling down the river. Jon Doggett: Yeah. Chip Flory: Yeah. Dusty Weis: Wow. I'm stumped. Okay. Did not expect that. Okay. Coming to you Chip, on a dark desert highway. Chip Flory: On a dark desert highway, I've been running... No. Dusty Weis: This is something I know very little about, nothing in my hair. That's the Eagles. Hotel in California. Chip Flory: Okay. I'm terrible at this. Dusty Weis: Jon Doggett. Jon Doggett: Sir. Dusty Weis: Old black water, keep on rolling. Jon Doggett: Yeah. That's Creedence. No, no, no, no, no, no. Dusty Weis: It's not. Jon Doggett: That's Doobie Brothers. Dusty Weis: That is Doobie Brothers. What's the next part of the lyric phrase? Old black water keep on rolling. Chip wants to steal. Chip Flory: Mississippi moon once you keep on shining on me. Dusty Weis: There we go. That's a point for each of you there. Jon Doggett: Oh boy. Woo. Dusty Weis: I told you this was going to be good. Yeah. Jon Doggett: Yeah. Dusty Weis: All right. Let's get back to the 1970's here. Chip? Chip Flory: Yeah. Dusty Weis: Thunder only happened when it's raining. You could sing it if it helps. Chip Flory: Lovers only... Oh, what is it? Lovers only. Is that right? Dusty Weis: You're so close. You're so close. It's not lovers. I'm going to give you the first one, it's players. Chip Flory: Players only- Jon Doggett: Keep on playing. Chip Flory: I don't know. Oh, I could sing it if it was playing. Dusty Weis: Players only love you when they're playing. Chip Flory: Players only love you when they're playing. Dusty Weis: Dreams. Fleetwood Mac. Chip Flory: Yes. Dusty Weis: That's the one. Jon, coming to you again. This is a good one. I can't not say it in the cadence, you get up every morning from your alarm clocks warning. Jon Doggett: Take the 815 through the city. Dusty Weis: There you go. There you go. Band and song? Jon Doggett: Oh gosh. Chip Flory: Oh, I got it. Dusty Weis: Go. Chip Flory: Bachman Turner Overdrive, Taking Care of Business. Dusty Weis: There you go. BTO. Jon Doggett: Yeah. Yeah. You used to play that in the fraternity house all over and over and over and over, getting it on an old, old, old stereo with really bad speakers. Chip Flory: Yeah. When the afternoon of AgriTalk first started off, for two years it was called Market Rally. At the bottom of the hour for about six months, we used it for bump every day, Taking Care of Business. Jon Doggett: Taking Care of Business. Dusty Weis: All right. Last question. Right now, the score Jon six points, Chip five. This is to tie, possibly to break the tie. Chip, welcome back my friends to the show that never ends. Chip Flory: My friends to the show that never end come alive- Dusty Weis: Doggett's got it. Chip Flory: Got it? Jon Doggett: It's Beatles, from the Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Dusty Weis: Oh. That's Emerson Lake and Palmer. Jon Doggett: Oh God. Chip Flory: Emerson Lake and Palmer. Dusty Weis: Welcome to the- Jon Doggett: Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah. That's the... That never answer. That's the opening of what song? Chip Flory: Come alive. Dusty Weis: Karn Evil 9, the very strangely named song, it's we're so glad you could attend, come inside, come inside, come inside. Spoken like a carnival barker. There we go. We settled it. All right. With six points to five, Jon Doggett. Jon Doggett: Hey. Dusty Weis: Is king cheese of music trivia, at least in the agricultural world. Jon Doggett: I missed some that I should not have missed, but you know what? The heat was on and frankly- Chip Flory: I'm not sure why were there no Nickelback questions. Dusty Weis: Because I value my dignity Chip. Chip Flory: No, don't be a fun hater. Dusty Weis: Jon, do you want to lock us out here? Jon Doggett: You know, I do. I just want to say to Chip, thank you so much for doing this, this has been a lot of fun, we've got 28 podcasts now? Dusty Weis: This is number 30. Jon Doggett: I'll tell you what, we've had a lot of fun, but this has been probably the most fun and I truly value our friendship, our partnership. Chip Flory: Absolutely. I do too.

    "content": "The U.S. House Committee on Agriculture held a hearing today to review the role USDA programs can play in addressing climate change. Several coalitions that the National Corn Growers Association participates in were invited to provide testimony, including the AGree Economic and Environmental Risk Coalition, Bipartisan Policy Center’s Farm and Forest Carbon Solutions Task Force and the Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance. “We believe that policies should be voluntary, and incentive-based; that they should advance science-based outcomes; and that they should promote resiliency and help rural economies better adapt to climate change,” said Charles F. Conner, president and CEO of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives and co-chair of FACA. The witnesses told committee members that there are several ways that the USDA could help address climate change, including by: Strengthening the agency’s commitment to agricultural and forestry research to help provide farmers, ranchers and forest owners with the tools they need to adapt, mitigate and become more resilient to climate change. Streamlining the Natural Resources Conservation Service conservation practice approval process. Expanding broadband access in rural America. Continuing to develop science-based, risk-benefit policies allowing farmers to more easily access risk management tools to meet sustainability goals. The committee received the feedback as it continues to prepare for the reauthorization of the farm bill in 2023.",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association recently recognized Illinois Corn’s Managing Director Jim Tarmann for his work to secure vital funding for locks and dams along the Upper Mississippi River System. The recognition came at the end of Commodity Classic in New Orleans. “Jim spent years educating public policymakers about the importance of the locks and dams along the Upper Mississippi River System,” said Iowa farmer and NCGA President Chris Edgington. “Thanks to his efforts, billions of dollars are going to update this system that is so vital to farmers.” More than 60% of the nation’s corn and soybean exports are transported on the Mississippi River. Yet, many of the locks and dams along the river system have not been updated since the 1930s, leading to breakdowns that have delayed shipments along the river. Knowing that breakdowns along the system would lead to costly delays for farmers, Tarmann began decades ago advocating for updates to the system’s locks and dams. Thanks to his work, billions of dollars for the locks and dams on the Upper Mississippi River System were recently allocated in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was signed into law by Pres. Biden. For his efforts, Tarmann received a framed photo of Lock and Dam 25, which is located north of St. Louis and is a vital part of the river system.",

    "title": "Bill Introduced in Congress Would Provide Relief on Fertilizer Tariffs",
    "content": "Sen. Roger Marshall, M.D., and Rep. Tracey Mann introduced the Emergency Relief from Duties Act today. The bill would create emergency waivers for duties levied on fertilizers by the U.S. International Trade Commission. “Fertilizers and other inputs have been at an all-time high, and the war in Ukraine promises to drive up the price of products even more,” said Iowa farmer and NCGA President Chris Edgington. “Fertilizers have become increasingly hard to secure and pay for because of tariffs or the threat tariffs on imports. That’s why passage of this legislation would come as a welcome relief to farmers across the country.” The bill comes as the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) levied tariffs against imports of phosphate fertilizer at the behest of a U.S. fertilizer company. A petition for additional tariffs on urea ammonium nitrate is also being considered by ITC. This bill would introduce a pathway to establish a waiver of countervailing duties or anti-dumping duties for a year if there is an emergency situation including natural disasters, war, epidemics, labor disputes or major accidents. Edgington, state corn growers and NCGA have worked to educate members of Congress about the effects the tariffs are having on farmers and rural America.",

    "content": "The Minnesota Corn Research and Promotion Council, North Dakota Corn Utilization Council, U.S. Grains Council, National Corn Growers Association and Northern Crops Institute are hosting a trade school event for farmer members and stakeholders in Alexandria, Minnesota, on Wednesday, March 16. Held at the Arrowood Resort and Conference Center, the agenda will cover the benefits of trade, current hot button issues, regional trade topics, and key updates pertaining to policy initiatives and market development efforts. “Trade School gives folks an opportunity to learn more about the current global market that we all operate within,” said NCGA Manager of Market Development Michael Granché. “In 2020, the U.S. exported 2,550 million bushels of corn, which makes up roughly 17.5% of our entire demand portfolio, so it’s important that we’re all aware of current barriers to trade and that we’re all equipped with the information needed to talk about trade within our communities. Sometimes trade can easily be an ‘out of sight, out of mind’ topic since corn is widely grown in land locked states and it can be tough to visualize corn heading out on massive cargo ships making its way to China or Mexico. So, we have to work together to ensure this process is beneficial to both parties and that we’re moving this product efficiently. We say it a lot during Trade School but when trade works, the world wins!” Interested and in the area? You can register for the free event here!",

In a letter to the White House, American Farm Bureau Federation, Growth Energy, National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, National Sorghum Producers, and the Renewable Fuels Association explained that an immediate move to restore year-round sales of E15 can ease the impact of oil market disruptions and surging gas prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “As American families continue to confront skyrocketing gas prices, we write today to urge the Administration to take a simple action that can provide immediate relief at the pump while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions from the transportation sector,” wrote the organizations. “Specifically, we request that the Administration use its authority to authorize the year-round sale of gasoline blended with up to 15% ethanol in response to surging oil prices and expected fuel supply disruptions caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “As Russia’s harmful actions in Ukraine continue and further sanctions are potentially imposed against Russia, oil prices will likely continue to rise, creating still higher consumer costs and threatening U.S. energy and economic security. Expanding the volume of American-made ethanol in the U.S. fuel supply can help alleviate these issues, as ethanol is currently priced 70-80 cents per gallon lower than gasoline. And, by displacing imported petroleum, increased ethanol use will enhance U.S. energy security and independence, while reducing emissions and supporting America’s farmers and rural economies.” The full letter is available here.",

    "content": "U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack will be the keynote speaker during the General Session at the 2022 Commodity Classic held March 10-12 in New Orleans. The General Session is scheduled for Friday, March 11, at 9 a.m. at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center. Secretary Vilsack is expected to share his vision for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the role of U.S. agriculture in America’s economic vitality, including his thoughts on more, new and better market opportunities; expanded capacity and competition; exports performance; and rural development and climate programs. The General Session will also include a panel discussion with leaders of the five associations that present Commodity Classic: American Soybean Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Sorghum Producers, and the Association of Equipment Manufacturers. And, attendees will hear from key agricultural industry leaders on current priorities and trends. Secretary Vilsack was confirmed in February 2021 to serve as the 32nd U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. He returned to the role he previously filled for eight years, having been the longest-serving member of President Obama’s original Cabinet. Prior to that appointment, he served two terms as Governor of Iowa, served in the Iowa State Senate and as mayor of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. Before returning to USDA in 2021, Secretary Vilsack served as president and CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council. There, he provided strategic leadership and oversight of USDEC's global promotional and research activities, regulatory affairs and trade policy initiatives. He also served as a strategic adviser to Colorado State University’s food and water initiatives. Under Secretary Vilsack’s leadership, USDA is working to build back better by restoring the American economy, strengthening rural and historically underserved communities, responding to threats of climate change, creating good-paying jobs for American workers and the next generation of agricultural leaders, and investing in children and families. Education is a hallmark of Commodity Classic. In addition to the General Session, Commodity Classic offers Learning Center, What’s New, and Early Riser education sessions, along with other opportunities for education and events at the Commodity Classic Main Stage. In addition, Commodity Classic features a significant three-day trade show, entertainment, and the opportunity to network with thousands of America’s farmers and agriculture industry professionals.

    "title": "Ethanol Action Team Continues Focus on Increasing Ethanol Demand in 2022 and Beyond",
    "content": "Increasing ethanol demand through various research and infrastructure partnerships and sound public policy are key priorities for the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) Ethanol Action Team (ETHAT). NCGA continues its focus on short-mid and long-term ethanol demand in partnership with state partners. NCGA continues collaboration with automakers, retailers, pump manufacturers, environmental groups, scholars and the ethanol industry to drive higher ethanol blends in the U.S. “Our top priority is advancing ethanol as a key solution to addressing emissions and high fuel prices. Corn growers have to remain engaged on federal policy because we know today’s low-carbon ethanol is well-positioned, with the right policies, to help clean up transportation and continue to support corn demand,” said ETHAT Chair and Indiana farmer J.R. Roesner. “One of the key policies that would help advance higher blends of ethanol is the Next Generation Fuels Act. We are continuing our efforts to help more members of Congress understand the solutions ethanol offers and ask them to co-sponsor the Next Generation Fuels Act, as well as support near-term needs such as restoring full market access for E15.” The long-term demand potential of the Next Generation Fuels Act will be 5 billion gallons of ethanol or 1.8 billion bushels of corn. The legislation decarbonizes liquid fuels as vehicle technology advances and reduces harmful aromatics in gasoline, which improves air quality and health. Additionally, with the Next Generation Fuels Act, NCGA and its state partners continue working with Wayne Fueling Systems and other manufacturers to usher into the marketplace Underwriters Laboratories (UL) certified equipment with capacity to dispense 40% ethanol blends. Thanks to this partnership, NCGA has supported the sale of more than 75,000 new fuel pumps across the U.S., building out the infrastructure needed to support higher ethanol blends. “Another campaign we will expand this year is our communications initiatives in Washington D.C.,” said NCGA ETHAT Vice Chair and Iowa farmer Kelly Nieuwenhuis. “It is important for our message to be heard with policymakers, and we have a positive story to tell. Last year, we were in the market on T.V., had sponsored content on Politico, were the sponsors of the AgriPulse Deep Dive on Biofuels, and were seen on digital platforms. Continuing those efforts are imperative to our future success.” NCGA also continues its partnerships with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ONRL), the ethanol industry, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) on E15 approval in California and conversations around Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

    "title": "NCGA President Provides Testimony on Farm Bill Commodity Programs",
    "content": "The president of the National Corn Growers Association spoke today before the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture about the key challenges corn growers are facing and offered reflections on existing farm bill commodity programs. “NCGA has a long history of advocating for market-orientated farm policies, including commodity and crop insurance programs that help growers manage their risks,” Iowa farmer and NCGA President Chris Edgington told the committee. “Our focus continues to be on accessible and defensible tools geared towards revenue, which factors in both yield and price risks that growers may face throughout the growing and market seasons.” Edgington was invited by the committee to speak at the hearing, entitled “A 2022 Review of the Farm Bill: Commodity Group Perspectives on Title 1.” During the 2018 Farm Bill, NCGA supported increasing the opportunities for producers to choose between the commodity programs, Edgington noted. Thanks to that work, producers were able to elect between the Agriculture Risk Coverage County, ARC-Individual and Price Loss Coverage programs in 2019, and, since 2021, they have an annual opportunity to change their elections. Growers are currently working with their Farm Service Agency offices ahead of the March 15, 2022, deadline for program elections for the upcoming crop year. Read the testimony here.",

    "title": "#ICYMI: RFA Salutes National Corn Growers Association With 2022 Industry Award",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) received the Renewable Fuels Association’s 2022 Ethanol Industry Award in recognition of the group’s dedicated and sustained efforts on behalf of the ethanol industry over the last 40 years. The award, RFA’s highest recognition, was presented at the 27th annual National Ethanol Conference earlier this week in New Orleans. “RFA and NCGA have worked together for decades on policy, market development, research, and promotional efforts aimed at growing our nation’s ethanol industry,” Cooper said. “NCGA CEO Jon Doggett was personally involved in the very early negotiations with RFA, the oil industry, and other ag groups in an effort that ultimately led to the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. That legislation created the RFS and set the ethanol industry on a growth path few could have imagined. And it was NCGA that laid out the first vision for a 15 billion bushel corn crop and 15 billion gallons of ethanol by 2015 that became the blueprint for expanding the RFS in 2007. Still today, NCGA continues to lead, being the driving force behind the Next Generation Fuels Act, which would build upon the success of the RFS by capitalizing on ethanol’s high octane and low carbon benefits.” Cooper added that NCGA has collaborated with RFA over the years on countless research and ethanol promotion efforts, such as technical work, market development programs, ethanol export initiatives, co-products research and development, and economic studies. “This is what a real partnership looks like, and we are so proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with our friends at NCGA as we identify and seize new opportunities for ethanol and agriculture moving forward.”",

    "title": "Country Music, Cowboy Boots and Corn Convene Together",
    "content": "Last week, an all-American trio came together in Nashville to paint the town with dynamic and collaborative Beltway brushstrokes: country music, cowboy boots and corn. Representatives from both national and state corn grower associations were in attendance for the tandem events held by Farm Journal—the Top Producer Summit and the Trust In Food Symposium. At the Top Producer Summit’s “Business on Broadway,” NCGA showcased the value of associations and partnerships, targeting to connect with interested producers who are not yet engaging with their state and/or national corn association. As part of the program available to attendees, NCGA Vice Presidents Brooke Appleton and Jim Bauman virtually hosted two different sponsored sessions--“How Washington Affects Your Bottom Line - A Legislative and Regulatory Update” and “Driving Corn Demand through Ethanol Infrastructure and Regulatory Avenues” which was moderated by Board Chairman John Linder. Both sessions were well attended and provided an opportunity for conference participants to engage with panelists and ask questions about NCGA’s scope of work and priorities. Wednesday night, Top Producer attendees were welcomed to NCGA’s Corn Social reception to further encourage networking and collaboration across the sector. In a “Climate-Smart State of Mind” over at the Trust In Food Symposium, Rachel Orf served as a panelist alongside Michelle Rossman (Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy), Ashley McDonald (National Pork Board), and Kira Everhart-Valentin (United Sorghum Checkoff Program). This “Mainstreaming Climate-Smart Ag Throughout Our Industries” session allowed each to share their commodity’s strategies and tactics to dynamically engage stakeholders across the sector while ensuring continued collaboration in order to achieve set sustainability goals. Wednesday’s symposium programming also included a “Human Dimensions of Change” working session where both national and state corn staff could share perspectives, roadblocks and insights in overcoming barriers to conservation practice adoption. “My time in NCGA office started during the pandemic, and it has been one of my goals to do anything and everything in my power to help this industry get righted again. Getting out to in-person events like these—Top Producers and Trust In Food Symposium—also gets us back to having those big conversations with one another,” said Chairman Linder. “It’s important as chairman and as a corn grower to be out here and telling our stories to others. The great story for me is that our team is really working hard to provide on our mission of increasing opportunities for our growers.”",

    "title": "Mark These CRP Deadlines on Your Calendar!",
    "content": "Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a federally-funded and voluntary land conservation program administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Agricultural producers and landowners can sign-up to ensure that environmentally sensitive agricultural land is not farmed or ranched but instead devoted to conservation benefits. In 2021, the USDA announced updates to CRP and extended the deadline for enrollment as farmers and landowners evaluated their options. That year, producers and landowners enrolled 4.6 million acres into CRP sign-ups, including 2.5 million acres in the largest Grassland CRP sign-up in history. There are currently 22.1 million acres enrolled, and the Farm Service Agency (FSA) is aiming to reach the 25.5-million-acre cap statutorily set for fiscal year 2022. This year’s General CRP sign-up ends March 11, and the Grassland CRP sign-up will run from April 4 to May 13. General CRP helps producers and landowners establish long-term, resource-conserving plant species, such as approved grasses or trees, to control soil erosion, improve water quality and enhance wildlife habitat on cropland. In return, FSA provides participants with rental payments and cost-share assistance. Contract duration is between 10 and 15 years. Additionally, Grassland CRP is a working lands program, helping landowners and operators protect grassland, including rangeland and pastureland and certain other lands, while maintaining the areas as working grazing lands. Protecting grasslands contributes positively to the economy of many regions, provides biodiversity of plant and animal populations and provides important carbon sequestration benefits to deliver lasting climate outcomes. Alongside these programs, producers and landowners can enroll acres in Continuous CRP under the ongoing sign-up, including projects available through the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) and State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement (SAFE).

    "title": "EP. 29 - National Security, Food and Geopolitics, with Col. Mark Purdy from Aimpoint Research",
    "content": "A potential Russian invasion of Ukraine and other global flashpoints have real implications for the corn industry. Heightened tensions in Eastern Europe have dominated the news lately, as Russia seems poised to invade Ukraine. As a result of this and other global flashpoints, the unstable geopolitical climate is creating uncertainty in the world of agriculture, and growers are already feeling the effects. So in this episode, we’re talking to Colonel Mark Purdy, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at Aimpoint Research, about how food security is vital to national security. We’ll sort out the context of the showdown in Eastern Europe, explore scenarios for what’s likely to happen, and provide some insight about what this could mean for growers here in the U.S. Most importantly, we’ll revisit how food power is vital to national security in the U.S. DIRECT SHARE LINK Mark Purdy: When it comes to the stability of society, I call it food power. Our center of gravity in the United States is not only the ability to produce food for our population, but our national security, if you think about center of gravity, is our ability to overproduce. Dusty Weis: Hello and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host, Association CEO, Jon Doggett. From the fields of the corn belt to the DC beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America, have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: Heightened tensions in Eastern Europe have dominated the news lately, as Russia seems poised to invade Ukraine, and the unstable geopolitical climate is creating uncertainty in the agriculture world as well. In this episode, we'll be talking to Colonel Mark Purdy, the executive vice president and chief operating officer at Aimpoint Research, about how food security ties to national security and what these global flashpoints can mean for growers here in the US. But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app, also make sure you follow the NCGA on twitter @nationalcorn. And sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. Dusty Weis: With that, it's time to once again introduce Jon. Jon Doggett the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. And Jon, for the vast majority of American consumers in this day and age, we take it for granted that, when we go to the store, there's going to be food on the shelves and it's going to be safe to eat. But that convenience and security are due of course, to the hard work of growers, but also to the high standard of security that we enjoy as American citizens. Jon Doggett: You know Dusty, when I first came to Washington DC in the 1980s, Kika de la Garza, a Democrat from Texas was the chairman of the house ag committee. And he used to tell the story that people called the submarine story. And the chairman told the story that he went to some submarine base and he was on this sub and they took him out and he thought it was great. He asked the captain of the submarine, \"How often do you have to fuel up?\" And he said, \"This is nuclear boat, we can go for forever.\" He said, \"Well, what about air?\" He said, \"Well, we can scrub the whatever out of the air and we don't really need to worry about air.\" \"And what about water?\" \"Well,\" he said, \"We can take the salt out of the water and we're all good for water.\" The chairman asked the captain, \"So what is your limitation?\" And the captain said, \"The limitation is how much food we have on the boat.\" Jon Doggett: Like I say, the chairman's told that story many, many times, but I think it's a good illustration about the importance of food and the importance to our national security. It's been a while since we've had that discussion and it's gotten a lot of attention here in the last few months, and it's a real threat to lives and to peace, as we look at what's going on in Eastern Europe. The continuing military standoff along the border between Russian and Ukraine, it has a lot of far-reaching business implications as well. We're talking about crude oil being near a hundred bucks where I saw something this morning, some of the analysts were talking about 125 bucks for a barrel of crude, and that's going to impact how we raise food in this country and how food gets distributed around the world. We thought this is an important moment, and we wanted to bring back a guest who we know is an expert on a lot of these things. And we've talked in the past to Colonel Mark Purdy, and Mark's going to be with us today. Dusty Weis: Yeah, Colonel Purdy is the executive vice president and chief operating officer at Aimpoint Research, a strategic consulting firm that specializes in applying a military tactical mindset to business problems. He's a former Army colonel who graduated from West Point Academy and served as the director of war games at the US Army War College. His experience ranges from leading combat units to managing multi-billion dollar security assistance portfolios. Jon Doggett: Mark has also helped us here at NCGA by overseeing some strategic planning exercises that we've done. And he traces his roots back to a family farm in Ohio, where they grew sheep, corn, soybeans and hay. Mark, thanks for joining us again. Mark Purdy: Well, great to be with you here and especially glad to be here to talk about something that has really been my why, behind what I do, for not only almost 30 years in the military, but definitely here at Aimpoint, in that food security being something that's foundational to national security. Great to be here with you and thanks for having me back. Jon Doggett: Well, thanks. Let's start with the Ukraine, and that's what everybody's been talking about. I flipped on the news early this morning and that's about all I saw. How did we get to this point? And why would Russia want to invade the Ukraine? Mark Purdy: Jon, I'm glad you picked such a simple topic to start off here with Ukraine. So Ukraine and why would Russia do this? This dates back not decades, and arguably not even back centuries, but millennia, but it's within the Russian sphere of influence. Just in recent history, this was part of the former Soviet Union and that buffer state there, and that has been the case. There are a lot of ethnic Russians in Ukraine, and so the tie there, it's not a simplistic geography or demographics there, for one. Mark Purdy: Two, when you take that into consideration, we had the overtures of Ukraine possibly joining NATO. I think it's a little bit when you back an animal in a corner, they're probably going to do something and take action. While we can line up some of the near term cost being substantial for Russia, President Putin is doing some long term calculus here when he comes to contemplating what inaction might cost the nation of Russia of over the next century, and what action would cost in the near term or near decades. That's why this is definitely a heightened sense of tension and why you think a lot of the predictions, or at least cautions of some of our leaders, the President in the United States and others, are saying that this is a real problem and has potential. Dusty Weis: Mark, I've heard Ukraine referred to as the breadbasket of Eastern Europe as well. Not that I'm trying to shoehorn agriculture into this stage of the conversation, but I really wonder what sort of role that has? The fact that this is a very rich, fertile farming region that's in play here and certainly served to provide food for a lot of the Soviet Union. Do you think that's part of the enticement that's in play here too? Mark Purdy: Well, I think it's certainly a factor. When you think about resources, and back to Jon's point about the submarine, and that is certainly a national and global piece. If you have control of those resources, whether it's fuel, whether it's certain minerals, oil, but food is definitely important. Russia being able to control that, Russia being a large producer of wheat, Ukraine being home to some of that most fertile black soil, and the production power of Ukraine is not fully realized, that would certainly be a resource that Russia could enjoy if they did have control over that region. Jon Doggett: It's been a long time since we saw a war in Europe on the scale that is a possibility here. It's hard to imagine what that impact's going to be, so Mark, what does a Russian invasion of Ukraine even look like if it does happen? Mark Purdy: Yeah, that's a great question. As I'm looking at a lot of the headlines and digging a little deeper from a national security perspective, the Europe that we knew back in the 80s, 70s, really post World War II, it's not the same Europe that was fairly stable at the time. We had, of course, two world powers, as well as NATO, poised at one another. The Soviet Union and NATO across the line, but there was a lot of stability that came with that. I think over the past decades we've seen how difficult things are to operate in the EU, and different militaries, Russia is not the former Soviet Union, but they've invested quite a bit within their military. So I think not only can we see maybe some hearkenings back to pre World War II and just the fragmentation of Europe, that's possible, although this has unified NATO in a way that we haven't seen in several decades. Mark Purdy: Back to what does an invasion look like? It's going to be different. This is where we'll see, and have seen the cyber component of it, information warfare. We're seeing that to where Russia is making intelligence evident on the news, and the United States and allies have as well. That's something that, if you think about it, we really haven't seen in the past. The stuff that was intelligence and was secret, stayed secret, but we're seeing this information warfare play out right in front of us on the news, as well as the cyber, so that's something different. Then I think we'll definitely see some conventional combat as we look at the tanks and the infantry and the anti-tank weapons on both sides, as well as the aircraft and helicopters, but then there'll be a lot of unconventional warfare, should this come to pass. Jon Doggett: The US and its NATO allies, they're in an odd position. Ukraine is not a NATO member, but it's petitioned the alliance for membership. How does that play into this? And what courses of action does the US have at this point? Do we defend Ukraine, even though it's not an NATO member? Or is there a lot of pressure from the NATO allies for us to get more involved or less involved? How does all that play with Ukraine not being a NATO member, but kind of wanting to be a NATO member? Mark Purdy: Well, I think we definitely want to play a part in Ukraine's defense, that's part of the global competition and our way of life and the leadership role that the United States has played in the world. I think that there's an impetus and that that's seen as a requirement. And when we think about NATO, and as I said before, Ukraine's petition to be in NATO may have been the impetus for a lot of Russia's actions at this point. I think the Article 5 requirements, so an attack on one is an attack on all, is not a requirement in Ukraine. But if this spills over and what does spill over mean, when we talk about this next generation of warfare? Is a cyber attack a spill over? Is some of these other guerrilla actions a spill over, or is it just defined by conventional attack? Mark Purdy: That's where I think we get into some new waters, and things are going to get dicey here if there's actually a full scale war in Ukraine. I believe that we'll attempt to keep that arms distance, supplying logistics and arms and weapons and advice, but it's real easy for this to spill over and then we're into again, Article 5 and the other aspects of NATO. Jon Doggett: It makes you nervous when you realize that most of those troops from Russia are within 30 miles of the Ukraine border. And most of those troops are 19, 20 and 21 years old, and they have weapons. And knowing a lot of 19, 20 and 21 year olds, that's a little disconcerting to me. How much of an accident is there to happen here? Mark Purdy: Well, I think you've hit on it right there. I mean, when you get down to the tactical commanders on the ground, in all armies, in our army in the United States, as well as some to a lesser degree, but most nations around the world, those commanders have authority on the ground. We already saw today where there's accusations back and forth between Ukraine and Russia, that they're violating the ceasefire from the conflict around the 2014 Crimea. And then also the insurgent or unconventional warfare that's been taking place there. Mark Purdy: There's already the accusations and the gray areas and ambiguity that again, would the license either side or license Russia, at least enough of a license in their mind, to take action. And then you have this other factor of these young commanders there or maybe it's not the young commanders, but they don't have the full picture in mind of what their tactical actions could cause at a strategic or global level. Dusty Weis: I know you don't have a crystal ball and certainly the situation is changing day by day, even hour to hour right now, but what do you think is looking like the most likely outcome at this point? Is a full-scale invasion a given? Mark Purdy: I don't think it's a given. Again, there's calculus that Russia's playing right now, that Vladimir Putin has in his mind, and I'm not saying he's already made up his mind, but there's a calculus. What I will say in my crystal ball, is this tension's going to stay at a heightened level for years, probably decades. I think that Russia is probably trying to get back to some of that 1980s sphere of influence that they've lost. I mean, if you think back to '89 and through the 90s and purely in East versus West, the West has been encroaching on Russia more and more. I think that this move of troops, right now it's new, it's the amassing of whatever, a 100,000, 130,000, 150,000, that I'm not seeing that... Even if we don't have conflict, even if we don't have invasion, that that's probably not going to change. Jon Doggett: Whether Russia goes into Ukraine or stays on the border, what are some of the immediate implications for food? Not only in Europe, but around the world? Mark Purdy: Yeah, this is big, and we touched on it a little bit, just Ukraine being termed as the bread basket, especially for Europe there in a big way. Just take two commodities that are near to us in the United States, in corn and wheat. Wheat definitely, if you take Russia, Ukraine, throw in maybe the stands there, that's a third of the world wheat that's coming out of that area. A conflict for sure is going to disrupt a third of the world wheat, and that has huge implications when it comes to food. Think about, what was the impetus for the Arab Spring? I mean, it was this tight wheat, we can trace that right back to that significant point in recent history, and we can see similar things, so the effects can reverberate across the globe. Mark Purdy: Now corn, not as big, but when you're talking 10%, 12%, 15% of anything global, that's huge, so we'll see second and third order effects as we talk about what's happening around the globe. It'll be tight supplies, it'll be high commodity prices maybe for a point in time, which means people are going to have a hard time getting a hold of the food that they need, food inflation and things like that. That's all coming out of, if not direct, a second and third order effect of... I think it's going to be lesser if it just remains this high tension, but it's going to be severe if we experience some type of invasion like we've contemplated here today. Dusty Weis: I mean, that's what happens in the immediate sense then there Mark, but longer-term, how does that all play out for growers here in the US, would you say? Mark Purdy: Yeah, and I alluded to it a little bit, but I think in the near term there's likely to be some spike in commodity prices, but then how does the rest of the globe react? Do they start looking for alternate sources, alternate types of food to meet the demand? I think the impact could be volatility. And then when we think about one area of outlet for food for some of our commodities versus fuel, versus some of the other uses, it's going to, I think create a lot of volatility. It might be some near-term gains, but probably, in the long term, we'll see some wild swings to high and low commodity prices. And then just layer that in with some of the other things that we already have going on, with inflation, with input costs and things like that. We've kept this conversation to Russia and Ukraine, but we've got a lot of other things going on around the world when it comes to competition and conflict. Jon Doggett: That was where I wanted to ask the next question and we have a number of hot spots around the globe. We have China, we still have situation in Syria, we are just getting off of two of the longest lasting wars that this country's ever been involved in, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and those certainly are by no means settled. We have Narcoterrorism South of the border. What about these hotspots? What about China? What about the Middle East? This just keeps piling on, and piling on, and piling on, it's a little disconcerting. Mark Purdy: Yeah. I mean, that's a great point. Because if you take what's the relation between Ukraine and Russia to China? Well, it's big. China looks to Ukraine to offset its dependency on any US commodities for corn and soybeans, especially when we're seeing what we're seeing in South America with the lingering effects of La Niña. Our disputes and competition with China certainly play into this, but that's just as big. When you think about the layering effects of volatility, so China comes to the US because we have what they need. When they can get it elsewhere, sometimes they do so the predictability there is not always there, so that leads to volatility. Mark Purdy: Other places around, when you think about, just to talk a little bit more of things that are layered into this, I mentioned La Niña. We thought we would be out of it, right now it's looking like that that's going to stick around probably into 2022, and that's a significant factor when we look at the major production zones. We have the United States and then what we're talking about here, Ukraine and Russia, but number two to the United States, is South America. And the effects of La Niña down there, it's looking like it's going to carry in further into 2022, so I think the volatility is going to increase. Now, when we're out of that, I think we're going to swing back the other way, so it's a big deal. Jon Doggett: Mark, after nearly 20 years being in Afghanistan, we're back out. What are you worried about in Afghanistan? Mark Purdy: Afghanistan. We talked a lot about conventional risks with Ukraine. As the person that participated in the last two decades of these longest wars, I think what it's devolved into, it's disheartening. The base that Osama bin Laden set over there was in this chaos, so I think that we're running the risk of that, because they've descended into chaos. Descent into Chaos, there's actually a book on Afghanistan about that, pre-invasion 2001, and I think we're back there. Mark Purdy: I know that our special operations community and others are actively fighting this behind the scenes. I mean, we just saw the attack on the new ISIS leader, at least new from al-Baghdadi, so that fight is certainly being carried out there. But I mean, when you get into the chaos and we do have the distance created in Afghanistan. Distance physically from Western forces, distance in infrastructure and elsewhere, there's a lot of places to go and hide there, and you can form bases of operation. From a unconventional space, I think Afghanistan's becoming ripe again as it was in the 90s. Jon Doggett: What would be the other place that we're not looking at that we ought to be looking at? Mark Purdy: I guess as far as a country with resources and economy, Nigeria always causes me concern because there's food insecurity there and yet there's money, but it's also a crossroads for a lot of terrorism and terror. Jon Doggett: And again, you have another population, a lot of unemployed, young men, never a good thing to have in a country where you have a lot of graft, a lot of corruption, a lot of poverty. And then you have this oil wealth that is being controlled by very few people. Mark Purdy: Right. The Middle East, I think is still of concern. I do believe that the Arab Spring shook some of these leaders into, at least that they're managing it more closely. There's maybe lessers of two evils leading in some of the areas, but I don't think we can take our eye off of what's going on. Specifically in Yemen, we've got Iran in the equation. I don't know as we're missing it, but we didn't talk about it. North Korea, I mean they're back to testing missiles, that's a big one for food security. It's a use case in food security and how that's used, I think it could be a powder keg. When you think about the ability to project power, so China's kept them from imploding, with food, so that's why food is so important. Mark Purdy: What we've done there and what we've allowed, we've also contributed to that so that we don't have to fight a conventional war there. But when it comes to global proliferation, that's something that should keep anyone up at night. Or maybe some of us will just stay up at night, others should just stay away from it so you get some sleep. Because they have nuclear reactors, they're building reactors for Syria. Of course the Israelis took care of some business there. They're partnered up with Iranians and elsewhere so I think Kim Jong-un knows it's a red line when it comes to nuclear and trading that stuff out, but he gets desperate at times too. Jon Doggett: The big difference of where we are right now versus where we were in the 80s and in the 90s, is we're energy independent. Huge gain for this country. And I think it's one of the things, a lot of folks, our organization included, worked on, is to develop more energy sources. And we've had the development of the natural gas with fracking and all of those things, and I think it really helps a lot, but how secure are we with our food supply right now? We can produce a lot of food in this country, but in light of what happened after COVID, how fragile are we with this food security in this country? Mark Purdy: Yeah. And that's great, and I'm going to expand it out a little bit beyond just how food secure are we. I think it comes down to our distribution, but if you think about, there's several world leaders out there that have said you're only three meals away from chaos, regardless of how developed your society is or how fortunate you are, and we saw some of that in COVID. I mean, just the runs on the stores when we even thought we might have a shortage. Security, when it comes to the stability of society, I think we're a little more fragile than we thought, and that has to do with some distribution. When we look at, I call it food power, so when we're talking about what we in the United States have, we have food power, which means we can feed a good portion of the rest of the world. It means that others look to us for stability. It means that we can feed our population in a way that we are able to build our economic power, and we use food for diplomatic power. Mark Purdy: Of course, back to your example, our military power, if you think about it, it doesn't happen without having this food security. Our center of gravity in the United States is not only the ability to produce food for our population, but our national security, if you think about center of gravity, is our ability to overproduce and supply the rest of the world. Where are we on that? I think we're at a point of intersection, because as we look at some of the drivers out there, just this volatility in the market and demand around the world, but then also the move for a focus on the environment, which we need to do and we need to embrace it, but we need to incentivize environmentally sustainable practices that maintain and increase the ability to produce. Mark Purdy: That's where I'm hopeful and concerned at the same time, because returning to practices of two centuries ago, to help the environment, is not where we need to go to maintain our food power. We need to take care of this planet, we need to take care of our soils, waters and the air, but we need to do it focused on the newest and best technology, which we have, and incentivize that so that we maintain our position of food power in the world. A little longer answer to your question than maybe you were looking for, but I'm pretty passionate about that because food security is national security, and it's really America's food power, which are corn growers, growers of all type, deliver. We need to do this right. We need to focus on our environment and we need to take care of it, but we got to do it right. Jon Doggett: Mark, how dependent are we on foreign-sourced inputs? Because all I've heard from growers in the last three, four months is fertilizer prices, fertilizer prices, fertilizer prices. Then I heard this last week about glyphosate, you can't get a tractor or a combine because they don't have chips. How does that weigh in on this? Mark Purdy: This is a big deal as well, we are very dependent on foreign entities for our inputs. There are some of them that, maybe not singularly exclusive, but nearly singularly exclusive to China when we're thinking about that. Others, India's a big player, so it's good at least we have some diversification across those two competitors, but that's in some of the fertilizers and other inputs. Mark Purdy: But then we look at, like you said, our chips and the technology and just that there's these single sources of inputs that we're relying on, and COVID's really exposed that, and that needs to be part of this greater dialogue in the private sector, to be able to diversify our supply chains. But I think it's also in the policy sector, we've got to figure this out because you don't have military power, you don't have economic power, diplomatic power, informational power, without food and the food power, and our food power is our ability to overproduce. The things that you highlighted here, or some of the things that I talked about, is absolutely important. Jon Doggett: All right.

    "title": "Senators Highlight Environmental, Economic Value of Ethanol and the Renewable Fuel Standard",
    "content": "Three U.S. senators today highlighted the environmental and economic benefits of corn ethanol during a hearing on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) held before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. During the hearing, Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), who serve on this important committee, discussed the transportation emission reductions that result from renewable fuels, ethanol’s contribution to lowering fuel prices and agriculture’s role in producing and improving renewable fuels, among other issues. “We appreciate Sens. Duckworth, Ernst and Stabenow for setting the record straight when it comes to agriculture and ethanol,” said National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) president Chris Edgington. “We were very pleased to have them highlight and include NCGA’s statement, which shows the environmental benefits of ethanol, into the hearing record.” NCGA’s statement to the committee explains how increased corn yields and corn production practices support soil health and water quality while lowering the carbon intensity for both corn and ethanol. It also describes farmers’ innovation and the technological advancements in corn production that enable farmers to produce more corn on less land and with fewer inputs than ever before, increasing feedstock supply while shrinking corn’s footprint. “From 2008 through 2020, the Renewable Fuel Standard resulted in nearly 1 billion metric tons of cumulative greenhouse gas savings, significantly exceeding projections, largely due to the reduced carbon intensity of corn ethanol,” said Edgington in the submitted statement. “Today’s low carbon ethanol is positioned with the right policies, to achieve net-zero emissions and continue to decarbonize transportation.” Low carbon liquid fuels are essential to decarbonizing transportation successfully and affordably, and ethanol is available now, Edgington noted.

The 2022 Commodity Classic will be held March 10-12 in New Orleans with the theme “The Future Is In Your Hands.” Attendees can register for all three days or for single-day attendance. Networking with other farmers is one of the top reasons farmers enjoy Commodity Classic, according to attendee surveys. “Commodity Classic attracts thousands of America’s best farmers from across the nation. We share a passion for agriculture and a thirst for knowledge, and we’re all interested in how we can make our farms more profitable,” said Gary Porter, a Missouri farmer and co-chair of the 2022 Commodity Classic. “The educational sessions always offer little improvements we can make that can help save money down the line, which really adds to the value of attending Commodity Classic.” Gerry Hayden, a Kentucky corn and soybean producer and 2022 Commodity Classic co-chair, said that striking up a conversation with other farmers is one of the most valuable aspects of Commodity Classic. “Everywhere you look, you’ll see other farmers who are just as serious about their operations as you are,” he said. “Meeting farmers from all over the country and learning how they run their own ship can really benefit your own farm. There’s just nothing like those in-person conversations, and there’s no better place to have them than Commodity Classic.” The 2022 Commodity Classic includes an impressive lineup of educational sessions, inspiring speakers, a huge trade show, entertainment, and a wide array of technology, innovation and agronomic information.

    "title": "Commodity Classic Salutes Long-Time Show Director",
    "content": "From the first Commodity Classic in 1996 through the upcoming 2022 event March 10-12 in New Orleans, one person, in particular, has been a constant guiding force for the annual agricultural trade show and educational event. Peggy Findley, the show director for the past 26 years, has announced that she will be retiring later this year, once her replacement is hired and the transition of duties for managing the 2023 event in Orlando is complete. Commodity Classic is actively recruiting candidates for the position at commodityclassic.com/join-the-classic-team. Findley was hired to help the American Soybean Association and the National Corn Growers Association combine forces to hold their annual meetings jointly, which they began doing in 1996 under the umbrella of “Commodity Classic” in Phoenix. “They were looking for someone with experience managing a joint convention,” she recalls, “someone who could help people understand other people’s point of view and work together.” It probably didn’t hurt that she was a strong personality brimming with confidence. “I called them up and said ‘I know you’re having a hard time finding the right person. Well, you can stop looking, because I’m the perfect candidate,’” she says, laughing. Bill Schuermann, ASA executive director for industry and state relations, says she was right. “The Classic experience wouldn’t be what it is today without Peggy,” he says. “She has been there from the beginning. Her energy and her ability to work with different farmers’ committees, the associations and all the exhibitors and other stakeholders and contractors are remarkable. We’ll miss her.” Findley says she’s proud to have helped ASA and NCGA transition to a joint event that has become America's largest farmer-led, farmer-focused agricultural & educational experience. After first working on Commodity Classic as NCGA director of meetings and conventions, in 1999 she started her own company, Strategic Resource Services Inc. in High Ridge, Missouri, and has had the Commodity Classic contract ever since. In a quarter-century of events in 14 different host cities, the number of farmers registered for Commodity Classic has nearly tripled. The number of exhibiting companies has grown from just under 150 in 1996 to more than 400 in recent years. Over time, three more major associations joined ASA and NCGA in making the Commodity Classic their official trade show and convention: the National Association of Wheat Growers (2007), National Sorghum Producers (2009) and the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (2016.) Findley credits wise direction from the farmer committee, whose guidance enabled the strong team of association staff and contractors “to grow the show and make the Commodity Classic the success it is today. “I feel very privileged to have been trusted and respected,” she says of her role with Commodity Classic. “I appreciate that they've given me the honor to represent them and be a part of the show.” She says she’s looking forward to slowing down a bit and spending time at home and traveling with her husband, who is recently retired “and loving it.” The 2022 Commodity Classic will be held Thursday, March 10, through Saturday, March 12, in New Orleans. This year’s theme is “The Future Is In Your Hands.” More than 50 educational sessions are on the schedule, covering a wide range of important topics including soil health, marketing strategies, increasing yield, creating efficient workflows, weather trends, ag technology and tactics to increase profitability. A full schedule of events is available at CommodityClassic.com. Commodity Classic is hard at work ensuring that this year’s show will be a fun and safe event that complies with Covid-19 guidelines.

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association submitted comments this week applauding the Environmental Protection Agency’s efforts to rein in exemptions provided to small oil refineries while calling on the agency to commit to the timely implementation of strong blending requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). “The RFS is a successful energy and economic policy for consumers, our environment and for farmers,” Iowa farmer and NCGA President Chris Edgington said. “A return to consistent and timely RFS administration in 2022 is key to maximizing carbon and pollutant reductions, expanding our energy supply to lower consumer costs, and supporting rural economic growth.” Edgington indicated in his comments that NCGA strongly supports the proposed 2022 RFS volumes, which include an implied volume of 15 billion gallons for conventional renewable fuel and an increase in total renewable fuel, while expressing opposition to proposed retroactive reductions from final 2020 volumes. “EPA’s proposal offers the promise of renewable fuel growth and a return to RFS integrity in 2022, but the proposed reconsideration of 2020 volumes would undermine that progress, rewarding the use of more oil in place of clean renewables,” Edgington said. “Corn growers stand ready to help EPA achieve greater emission reductions and cleaner air through use of more renewable, sustainable, affordable ethanol.” In a separate set of comments submitted to EPA this week, Edgington expressed appreciation for EPA’s proposal to change agency interpretation of the Clean Air Act’s small refinery provisions, applying that interpretation to deny pending small refinery exemption petitions under the RFS. In recent years, EPA had significantly increased the number of refineries granted RFS exemptions. In early 2020, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, following a legal challenge from NCGA and ethanol and agriculture partners, determined EPA had previously exceeded agency authority by extending exemptions for small refineries based on economic factors other than RFS compliance. “EPA’s proposal and denial of pending waivers offer a path forward,” Edgington said. “NCGA urges EPA to finalize this proposal without delay to close the chapter on RFS waiver abuse.”",

    "content": "This week, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) participated in the Cattle Industry Convention & NCBA Tradeshow to engage with corn’s largest animal ag consumer, beef cattle. The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association Annual Cattle Industry and Trade Show, #CattleCon22, was attended by thousands in the ag industry, including representatives of the National Corn Growers Association who were on hand to talk about beef and corn’s sustainability story. “The beef industry consumes over 1.25 billion bushels of corn annually,” said NCGA Market Development Director Sarah McKay. “It’s important for us to engage with our partners and talk to them about not only some of the exciting research and projects we are working on in the feed space but also the sustainable synergies between beef and corn production. We have a great story to tell in this space, and it’s important to continue working together to share that narrative.” NCGA hosted a Learning Lounge session, “Sizzlin’ Sustainability: Meating Consumer Demand with Corn-Fed Beef,” through the Market Development Action Team’s (MDAT) sponsorship of the Cattlemen Education Series (CES). The panel covered corn and beef’s sustainability relationship and how it ties into the overall marketability of beef while also discussing how these efforts deliver return on investment for ranchers and Certified Angus Beef (CAB). Panel participants included Troy Schneider, Chairman for MDAT; NCGA Chairman John Linder; Nicole Erceg, Director of Communications at CAB; and the panel was moderated by Sarah McKay, NCGA Director of Market Development. One out of four bushels of added corn demand is due to beef and pork exports, with the beef industry providing $5.7 billion in corn value. DDGS account for nearly 8% of total domestic corn usage. While at the convention, NCGA President Chris Edgington, Chairman John Linder, MDAT Chair Troy Schneider, and Chair of U.S. Meat Export Federation Mark Swanson, were interviewed on the radio show Agriculture of America on the American Ag Network. You can listen to the episode here. Chairman Linder also did an interview for NCBA’s Cattlemen to Cattlemen found on RFD-TV Network. NCGA President Chris Edgington also participated on a panel for a Sustainability Forum that was also held at the convention. Couldn’t attend this year?

    "content": "Allies of corn growers in the U.S. Senate sent a letter to EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan today calling on him to prioritize the Renewable Fuels Standard. Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), with the support from a bipartisan group of 12 senators, called on the administrator to maintain proposed blending requirements for 2022; deny all pending Small Refinery Exemptions; eliminate proposed retroactive cuts to the 2020 renewable volume obligations; and set 2021 RFS volumes at the statutory levels. “The RFS is a significant tool for EPA to reduce the carbon footprint of our transportation sector,” the senators wrote. “By taking the above actions, the EPA can quickly restore integrity, stability, and growth to the RFS and the U.S. biofuel sector while ensuring that the program continues to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, diversify our fuels, drive down gas prices, strengthen our national security, and drive rural economic opportunity.” NCGA’s leadership saw the letter as an important development. “We are highly appreciative of these senators for their efforts to protect the integrity of RFS,” said Iowa corn grower and NCGA President Chris Edgington. “The RFS is an important tool that we will need to use to the letter if we’re to meet the president’s ambitious climate goals.” Farmers also have a chance to weigh in with EPA on this issue, Edgington noted. He encouraged farmers to visit the NCGA Action Center and submit comments to EPA on proposed RFS volumes and denial of SREs through the Friday, February 4, comment deadline.

    "content": "Taking a close look at and defending the inputs used to grow corn every year will be an important goal for the Production Technology Access Action Team (PTAAT) of the National Corn Growers Association in 2021, according to Illinois farmer Kate Danner. Fertilizer prices are on the top of every farmer’s mind right now, says Kate Danner, chairperson of PTAAT, and it's important that organizations like NCGA examine all options to have a positive impact on issues like these. “NCGA exists to work for the nation’s corn growers and defend their interests,” says Danner, a farmer from northwest Illinois. “Skyrocketing fertilizer prices are just one of the issues we’re working to tackle right now.” Last year PTAAT commissioned a study to better understand the fertilizer market, what factors are contributing to the current increase in prices and, importantly, what options exist for NCGA to have an influence on price. The outcomes of that study will lead NCGA to continue to fight to reduce or eliminate the current tariffs in place in order to increase competition in the marketplace. PTAAT also closely follows the challenges confronting other corn inputs, including biotech seeds and crop protection products. “Every farmer knows that the products they use on their field are likely under fire in some way,” says Danner. “NCGA and PTAAT are charged with defending those products in a variety of ways – and showcasing how they contribute to larger sustainability goals – on our behalf and in protection of our future access to them.” Raising awareness of the importance of protecting and supporting pollinators like honeybees and monarch butterflies will continue to be a front-burner issue for Corn Growers as well.

    "content": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should look to farmers as it works to mitigate pesticide issues, a corn grower told members of a federal interagency working group (IWG) today. “We respect EPA’s responsibility in protecting the environment, including endangered species,” said Patty Mann, a corn, soybean and wheat farmer from Jackson Center, Ohio. “We ask that the agency work closely with growers, the ones who often know the land the best, in developing and enacting mitigation measures.” Mann’s remarks were made to the IWG, which is composed of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency. The IWG was established under the 2018 farm bill to identify and implement improvements to the federal government’s pesticide consultation process. Mann, who has worked with the National Corn Growers and Ohio Corn and Wheat on these issues, cautioned the group against imposing a one-size-fits-all approach to these efforts. “It is imperative that the EPA understand the real world, on-farm implications of mitigation measures,” she said. “Every farm and landscape has differences, so flexibility in implementing mitigation measures must be given for the best chance of success for both the farmer and the at-risk species.” EPA should build off the successful efforts already employed by farmers, Mann noted. “It is also important that the EPA understand and take into account measures that are already in place and used by farmers and their positive impact on the environment,” she said. “Conservation practices regularly serve more than one purpose.” Mann emphasized that continued dialogue between the IWG and farmers will be key to protecting endangered species and regulating pesticide use in a fair, transparent and predictable manner.",

DIRECT SHARE Transcript Chris Edgington: NCGA and Corn are present. They're involved. They're engaged, at the local level, at the state level, at the national level. Whether it's a federal policy meeting, whether it's a tax discussion, whether it's a local water waste problem, it's not about the people that are sitting on the board, but it's the organization as a whole. Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry, can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and it's future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host association CEO, John Doggett. From the fields of the corn belt to the DC beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: Last year was a mixed bag of news for the nation's corn growers. Corn prices climbed, but so did input costs. News about supply lines, infrastructure, and politics came fast and heavy, and 2022 is giving every indication of continuing at that chaotic breakneck pace. So in this episode, we're going to check in with NCGA president, Chris Edgington, to hear how all these big national news stories have impacted his operation in Iowa, what lessons he learned in 2021, and what growers need to know to thrive in 2022. Dusty Weis: But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also make sure to follow the NCGA on Twitter @NationalCorn, and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. Dusty Weis: And with that, it's time to once again introduce Jon, Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. And Jon, last year had a little bit of everything for growers. I don't know about you, but Christmas and New Year's this year just kind of felt like the first chance I'd had all year to even catch my breath. Jon Doggett: Boy. And I took a breath too, sometime a couple days before Christmas, and it was great. And then I started looking back on the year, and think about how many good things happened, and how many not so good things happened. Jon Doggett: You know, the other day, I was going through some things and getting ready for Commodity Classic. And I ran into the presentation I made at the awards banquet in 2020, and I was talking about 2019. And it's hard to believe that 2019 is just a couple years ago, but remember how crazy that was. And the weather was so awful, and we had such a horrible spring and worries about the crop. Jon Doggett: As I remember, what I presented was, \"Boy, am I glad to get to 2020. 2020 is going to be so much better.\" Well, then 2020 happened. And then we said earlier last year, \"Well, thank goodness we're in 2021. And '21 is going to be better than '20.\" Well, here we are one more time. It's 2022, and we got a lot of things to talk about. And a lot of things to talk about, what can we expect in 2022. But a little bit of going back and talking about what happened last year, and the good things that happened, and some of the things that we just need to talk about. Jon Doggett: So, what we want to do is level set a little bit. And with that, we're going to welcome the president of NCGA, Chris Edgington, from St. Ansgar, Iowa. Chris, welcome back to the podcast. Chris Edgington: Well, it's a pleasure to be back. And you were talking there about things that have happened. And honestly, I'd probably have to sit down and look at each individual month over the last 12, because there's probably been something happened that was fairly significant, somewhere in agriculture, in the last 12 months, on each individual month. Jon Doggett: Definitely. We had ups. We had downs. And you're right, we had a flavor of the month, it seemed like. Let's go through some of those things that happened. And the one thing, I think, that is great is corn prices came up, but some other things came up as well. So, what happened on your farm? What's your local cash price for corn today? And what are you paying for some of those inputs? Chris Edgington: Well, cash corn in north Iowa today is in the upper fives, bumping six. It's right there in that area. Deliver a lot of corn into the local ethanol plant which yesterday. So did about all of my friends and neighbors, from about a 50 mile radius. We sat in line for quite some time, but the demand is pretty good on that side. So, cash prices are around six bucks. $5.75. $5.80. $5.90. $6.00. Depends on your region. And yet, there's an awful lot of corn that's being delivered. Chris Edgington: It's got a four in front of it because of a lot of people that do some pricing ahead. They start pricing ahead back in April, May, June, when they're starting to plant the crop, and feel comfortable they're going to get it in the ground. And we weren't at these prices then. So there's some $4.00 corn, including our own, that's going to the market today. And while that's much better than $3 corn, it's certainly not where we are today. And it's one of the things people have to take into account. Jon Doggett: So, what about those inputs, Chris? Chris Edgington: You really want to go down that rabbit hole today, don't you? Jon Doggett: Oh, we ought to at least mention this recent unpleasantness. Chris Edgington: So, let's talk about the good ones first. Let's talk about the fact that seed costs are pretty stable, and seed supply is pretty stable. Which, a year ago, we had questions about that because of the derecho in Iowa, which wiped out a huge chunk of seed producing areas for various companies. There was concern would you have seed supply, a year ago at this time? And we did have enough corn. Guys did get the acres planted. And they had a pretty good production year on seed this year, and so prices are pretty stable on that area. Chris Edgington: Fertilizer. Different story. Fertilizer is up two or three times what it was a year ago. Supply is a concern. It depends on the product, whether you're talking about potash, or phosphorus, or nitrogen. They've all got various wrinkles going on. All three of them have had companies try to get countervailing duties or tariffs put on import products, of which, on phosphate, Mosaic and company have been successful on that. But you know, Jon, we're fighting that in the courts, and the judge is going to hear it. And we're going to talk about that here more this summer, when they start talking about it as well. Chris Edgington: But phosphate is become a real challenge for my neighbors. And do they put it on? Don't they put it on? I know some didn't put it on. Some didn't put as much on because of the price difference from a year ago. Chris Edgington: Nitrogen. They're trying to take a page out of the phosphate book. If it was good to put imports and countervailing on top of phosphate, let's try that for nitrogen. And what people don't realize is it's not just the cost of the tariff on the product coming in from a foreign country or foreign company. That affects the price of all the products, whether they're domestic produced or foreign produced. And so, you put a 10% tariff on products coming out of Russia, and nitrogen into the US, that effectively raised the price 10% across all nitrogen products, domestic or international. And so these tariffs and countervailing duties are causing some real problems. Chris Edgington: And there were some nitrogen shortages last fall. And there's some real concern about liquid nitrogen for this spring, which is what we use. I've had money out there since July on trying to lock in and stabilize some liquid nitrogen prices on a product that I won't use until April. And so, we are very concerned that will the product be there? Now, our supplier has been very dependable. Very reliable. And I truly trust that they will get us the product. But will it be in time? There could be some late deliveries. Could be some adjustments being made. And urea faces some of those same challenges, depends on where it's being used. But fertilizer's up two, three, some cases, four times from what they paid a year ago, in spot market situations. Chris Edgington: And then you can go over to the chemistry side, and herbicide, fungicide, and insecticide. And it looks like we're going to spend 70 to 90% more than what we did a year ago, all in, by the time I get done with fungicide, insecticide, herbicides on our corn and soybean acres. Chris Edgington: And there is a very big concern there on supply, especially imported Roundup, or imported glyphosate. That product is definitely in short supply, but I know people that are changing their chemistry programs, left and right. They're looking for different products, different ways to go, so they don't have to worry about, \"Is it going to get here?\" They're going to a product that they can use, that's available. Priced more than they like, but right now, when it comes to controlling weeds and bugs, availability of product is more important than the price. Unfortunately. Dusty Weis: So, at the end of the day, Chris, with corn prices up, and thank goodness for that and all that, but is your take home really that much better than it was before, with all these additional input prices? Chris Edgington: No. Take home hasn't hardly changed at all. And we didn't even touch on land rents, which also were up. Farmers understand that that is very much a function of revenue. You've got a lot of flex leases. You've got a lot of combination out there. You got your traditional cash. But rents are up as well. So, we get all done, no. We're going to spend several hundred dollars an acre more than we did a year ago, but the return is not looking to be a whole lot different. Jon Doggett: So, you're running in place a little bit. But Chris, what's the innovation going to be to deal with this? Do you see another two, three years here where we're going to see a lot of innovation, and a lot of new ways of doing things? Do you see a lot of change in the acres, and what we're going to plant? How do you see people reacting to higher corn prices, but higher input prices? Where do you see folks maneuvering? Chris Edgington: That's a lot in one question, Jon. So let's maybe touch on the acres first, because I get asked this quite a bit. I don't see a huge shift in acres. I think corn, wheat, and soybeans are going to be similar. We'll be in the similar acreage total that we were last year, and the year before. That's kind of where we have settled in. You've got some other commodities, especially in the south, with cotton, and rice, and peanuts, that can have some influence. But for the vast majority of the upper Midwest, where corn, soy and wheat are predominantly grown, I think the acre total will be similar. Now, the mix can move a little based on weather. It could be a million one way, a million the other. But I think, right now, we're not in a situation where you're going to have big changes. Chris Edgington: Farmers are pretty optimistic because of the price. They're grumbling on the inputs, but they're optimistic on what they can look forward, and use futures prices to establish a floor. And we're coming into crop insurance time. Obviously, we feel if we have a stable February, as far as December futures goes, that gives producers a really nice opportunity. Chris Edgington: And I think one of the biggest and quickest things we're going to see, I'm not sure this is innovation, but it's going to be trial and error, and that's what can they cut out? How much less nitrogen can they use? How much less phosphate can they use? How much less potash can they use? Do they have to put that sulfur out there again, like we've been doing? Do they need the zinc? Are they able to replace it with a biological that will help them? Are they able to replace it with no-till, minimum=till? Will cover crops help? Cover crops, maybe, help more on the herbicide side over time than they do on some of the other things, although they will help nitrogen in some ways. Chris Edgington: But there will be things going on. There always are. Agriculture has never stopped innovating from the very beginning. And so, there will be things go on. Chris Edgington: But I think the very first thing, and I actually heard of a study last week out of Missouri, that they actually think they're going to have less per bushel corn yield this year because producers are going to put less nitrogen on. And nitrogen is very closely related to corn, and corn yield. And so, they're already projecting that because of the cost, producers will cut 20, 30 pounds. Hope that the weather works out and cooperates, and they can pull some nitrogen out of the soil. If you get the proper mixture of bugs, and temperatures, and moisture, that you can actually get a little bit more nitrogen than normal. But I do think that's going to be the guys that have never variable-rated, may look at that. Chris Edgington: Strip-till may get some legs, more legs than it has out of this, because you put it in a band. You plant right on top of it. And in our operation, so far, we have not cut pounds out of strip-till from what we would've broadcast. But if we stay here for next year, definitely. Easy to take 20, 25% of your pounds out of that, and feel pretty comfortable that your root zone is going to be well managed for the next year's crop. Jon Doggett: Well, having corn prices pushing six bucks gives you a little wiggle room with some of that innovation. You can afford to make a couple missteps here and there. Not big ones, but it's certainly a whole lot easier than if that corn price was below four. So, innovation is always interesting. I'm always struck by how farmers and ranchers can figure out how to make do in interesting times, and we certainly have those. Chris Edgington: And the one other innovator that we work with every year is what is the innovation that Mother Nature gives us. And this last year, in my town, we were short of water. We were eight, nine inches under normal until the very end of August, and then we got all that in one night. And yet, other than one strip just a couple miles behind where I live to the east, and that strip was probably 20 miles long north to south, most of our area had a really good corn crop. That area over there was, probably, bushels below what everybody else was. But they kept missing those little bitty rains that we got, that kept us going along. And you could see it. You could see it. So, that tells you how close to teetering on the edge we were on water, for last year's growing conditions. Chris Edgington: Now, who knows? This year could be completely different. Hopefully, we do not have the wildfires out west. But you know what? We already got a big volcano that's disrupting the atmosphere. So, there's lots of things that can happen with Mother Nature that, regardless of how innovative we are, we still have to hope she innovates right along with us. Jon Doggett: Still seeing that back home, and saw that fire up close and personal in our place. Mother Nature is Mother Nature, and she doesn't like to be fooled, as the old ad goes. Jon Doggett: So, Chris, let's change subjects a little bit. Something that this organization did, that we got some accolades, some \"Thank you very much\" from our customers, and that's our sustainability report that we issued in April. What's important, in your mind, about that sustainability report? Chris Edgington: Well, there's several things when it comes to sustainability, and that report is all about sustainability is a slow crawl. We make small steps every year on water, soil, air, nutrient management. And you don't think you're doing much, and then you look back over time and you say, \"Hey, I'm 10%, 15%, 20% better than I was 10 years ago.\" Unfortunately, we've got some people that think you should you just be able to turn a switch and instantly things go easier. Our soils don't react that way. They take time. Chris Edgington: And so, one of the other things that come out of that, and people are more open to talking about than maybe we have in the past is, at the same time we need to be economically sustainable. And that's not just for the producer, that's for the consumer as well. Because I don't want high grocery prices. I really don't. It's a crazy thing. I'm in the food business, and yet I am the consumer as well. And I walk in the grocery store, and I don't want to see huge prices on fruits and vegetables, or canned goods, or fresh meats and eggs. So, I'm just like everybody else in that. So, we need to be economically sustainable and viable, both for the producers and the consumers. And we can do that. Chris Edgington: In fact, one of the interesting things is we have been doing that. We just haven't talked about it very much, and that's pretty normal for agriculture. We're pretty quiet. We go about our business. Do our thing. Try to do our very best to produce the food, whether you're in livestock, or crop production, or vegetables, or fruits, or whatever. And make sure it gets to the shelf in a wholesome manner, at a price. But we've been willing to talk more about the efforts that we're doing, whether it's cover crop, or no-till, or variable-rate chemicals, or variable-rate seed, or prescription technology, and autosteer. And so many of the other things that we just really didn't talk about, because most of my neighbors don't want to talk about it. They just want to go do it. Jon Doggett: You know, you coined a phrase two years ago that I picked up and have been using, without any attribution to you. But you have said, \"If you haven't been on a corn farm in the last five years, you haven't been on a corn farm.\" Tell me the three things that you have changed on your farm in the last five years that you think are the most significant. And not just on production, just overall. What are the three things you've done that are most significant, particularly when it comes to sustainability? Chris Edgington: Well, one of the things that's totally not part of this discussion, but I think it's a big piece, is we've made a major improvement in our grain handling. And so, the product that we have is higher quality. And so, in some ways that's been a big change, because we didn't fight some of the old quality issues that we had. I see that with my neighbors all over the place. Better bands. Bigger bands. Newer driers that are much more efficient, use way less fuel, way less natural gas or LP. And so, that whole piece is an area that probably gets forgotten about, but it was a big change for us on some grain quality things. And it will have a lot of long-term improvements. Chris Edgington: We continue to add to our technology uses with the autosteer, with variable-rate. I am a really strong proponent that anybody can variable-rate plant and put more seeds, or less seeds, in any one area, if you've been farming that field more than one or two years. Farmers will know their fields very quickly, what they can do, can't do. You get a couple yield maps. You take the time to study those maps. Chris Edgington: And one of the other ones that comes in, we continue to add tile. And it's all about water management. Because if the soil percolates well and the water moves correctly, things stay where they're supposed to. You don't get ponding. You don't get dead areas. You don't get lack of life. People look out and they'll see a pond in a field and they'll think, \"Well, the poor corn plant.\" The bugs and the night-crawlers underneath, they're in worse shape. There's no oxygen. They can't live in that at all. And so, you get a field properly drained, the water will filtrate through. Chris Edgington: I think I should have gotten in the tiling business. Those guys got a waiting list that's six miles long. There's constantly more and more effort to come in, because things like cover crop and no-till work better in a pattern-tiled field, than they do in a field with no tile. I have a good friend, neighbor, that's done a lot of this. And he says, \"First thing you got to do if you're going to strip-till, or no-till, or cover crops, you got to get the field tiled. You got to get it pattern-tiled so that the water moves.\" And around here, people used to put tile lines in at 80 to 100 feet apart. Today, they're putting them in at 50 feet, because they can see the difference on their maps. They can see the difference in their soil quality when the field is more uniformly drained. Chris Edgington: And so, they're all little things, Jon. I can't say that they're huge things, but they are small steps moving forward over time. I am talking about and doing things today that, I've been farming for over 35 years, that I never even thought about 20 and 30 years ago. Now, I've learned more about, probably, producing a corn plant the proper way and getting a good ear in the last 10 or 12 years, just in overall technology improvements, than I did in the first 25 years I farmed. Chris Edgington: My dad was on the very tail end of horses. Last fall, he climbs up in that half a million dollar combine. It's got 18 or 19 computers in it with little micro chips, and he operates it. And we've got iPads in there, and control screens, and autosteer, and he can do it. He manages it. My 34-year-old son, if he sees the same difference that my dad did... I think autonomous will probably be way more common than we think. Everybody still talks about what happens with the mudhole, or how do you get the planter filled, or how do you do some of the other things, but it will be a different style of farming. And not to say that grandpa and grandma, and everybody in the past, didn't do a great job. They worked with the tools they had at the time. And the tools continue to change, and so we need to be able to change with those tools. Jon Doggett: Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, had a great quote here a couple months ago. \"Things have never changed as fast as they are right now, and they'll never change as slowly as they are right now.\" My dad talks about putting up hay with mules, and what a change we've seen on our place, as just as you have on yours. Jon Doggett: Switching topics one more time, to a topic that I just as soon not talk about, but the staff put together a list of things that we are to talk about. We had a baseball game not too far from where you're at. Talk about that baseball game last summer. Chris Edgington: The baseball game was great, Jon. And if you'd quit flying American, you could probably get there. Just try one of them other airlines out once. And I say that with tongue-in-cheek because I fly Delta all the time, and I have my fair share of problems with them. So, it's just the convenience and ease of transportation. Chris Edgington: But the baseball game was a great opportunity to showcase agriculture. And we couldn't have had better weather. We couldn't have had a better game. The setting was great. And lots of questions coming out of that from people. \"Well, how do you do that?\" Chris Edgington: \"How do you get rows straight?\" Chris Edgington: \"How do you get the seed spaced evenly?\" Chris Edgington: \"How do you do this? How do you do that?\" Chris Edgington: Also, \"That wasn't sweet corn out there, was it?\" Chris Edgington: \"No, that was No. 2 Yellow,\" which we raise 90 million acres of No. 2 Yellow, and we raise one million acres of sweet corn. A fair number of consumers would think it's the other way around. And that's okay. We make 4,000 products out of corn, and we showcased just a couple of them there at the ballgame. And hopefully, we get it pulled off and get to do it again here this next year. And it will be tough to top a walk-off home run at the end. But it's just a great opportunity to talk about what we do on a daily basis. Chris Edgington: And what's interesting, and people get frustrated with it, but when people watch sporting events, they also pay attention to the downtime in-between activity. Whether it's a football game and the commercials, whether it's a baseball game and commercials, whether it's just the announcers talking as the next guy's coming to bat, or whatever. And you and I both been around long enough that we've been in a couple of those radio booths. And that poor announcer, they're handing him papers faster than he can talk most of the time, as he's trying to get all that through in a 20-second downtime between batters, or a short time out, and they don't actually go away, or something like that. But it's a great opportunity just to highlight some of the other things that are going on around the situation of that activity. Chris Edgington: And so it was fun. I was glad to be there. And I really hope that we get that opportunity again. Jon Doggett: And I'm going to come at least a couple days early this time. But the thing about the game was it wasn't what people learned, it was how it made them feel. It made people, whether you were a corn farmer, or otherwise involved in the industry, or just the folks at the retirement home in Helena, Montana where my mom lives, and she made everybody watch the game, it's how people felt about it. When those players came out of that field, it was a really, really neat feeling. And I think it was such a thrill for our organization to be such an important part of that. Dusty Weis: But I'll say this, Jon, too, because this is the MLB Field of Dreams game that was played out in Dyersville, Iowa. What the people didn't see on TV is just the amount of work that went on behind the scenes, for literal years, just to make that moment happen. And do you, Jon, want to take a moment to just talk about what went into that from NCGA's organizational side? Jon Doggett: Well, first of all, we went to our states and told them of what we were thinking about doing. And this game was supposed to have been played in 2020. The states came just, \"Absolutely. Let's participate in this. Let's invest in this.\" And we put some money into this, and a lot of work. And it took a number of personal meetings with MLB, a gazillion phone calls, and a lot of back and forth. And finally, it happened. And I think MLB was really surprised at what emotions that game brought out in people. And I know Chris and John Linder had a conversation with some of those folks connected with major league baseball after the game, and I think they were kind of surprised. Weren't they, Chris? Chris Edgington: Yeah, they were. And one of the things... I've been fortunate to be at a couple sporting events where the game ends and nobody leaves. They're just going, \"Wow. What did I just get to experience?\" And I talked to some people that watched it on TV, and then they felt the same way. So, even though we were in the moment, on-site, that whole 'what did I just experience?' was also felt through the television set, which is really cool. I mean, because that doesn't always happen. Chris Edgington: And Major League Baseball was, I think, more than excited. Probably the next day, they were probably even more excited when they realized that it was the most-watched regular-season game since 2005. So, they drew in a huge audience. People were very interested. The players. The managers. By the time they were done, I'd heard that they were maybe a little bit skeptical. But by the time they were done, they had thought it was the greatest experience they might have ever been in. And that was the Yankee manager said that. He says, \"I don't know if I've ever been in an experience as cool as what this was.\" Chris Edgington: And so, Major League Baseballs, they recognize they've got something there. It's taken baseball back to \"Let's play catch with our kids. Let's do this.\" Where did baseball come from, and the sandlot games? We all grew up watching some of the sandlot movies that are out there. Kids just going in the back yard and throwing a ball. And how many windows got broke in local neighborhoods because somebody overthrew, or hit a foul, or did something. And people just take it that that's just part of kids having fun. And that's part of what that game did, was it brought it back together. That baseball, as a family event, has been forever. And it's just an opportunity for people to spend a little time together as a family. Jon Doggett: So, Chris, let's talk about two things that happened, or didn't happen, in Washington. One is something that happened in Washington, and the other is something that didn't happen in Washington. And both's positives. Jon Doggett: One, we got an infrastructure bill passed, and we ended up not having to deal with stepped-up basis to pay for some of that. So, a very busy year. You were very involved in the stepped-up basis issue. You saw it as not only something important to the industry, but you could relate to it personally. Talk about how you felt as one, a farmer, and two, as the president of an agricultural organization. About what happened with the stepped-up basis, and where we are now, and how we got there. Chris Edgington: Well, I think that that whole tax discussion was a good example of people will put up with a lot when it comes to taxes. They understand we have to pay taxes. It's part of what drives our economy. It fixes our roads. It does the bridges. It does a lot of things. Chris Edgington: But people do not want to give up 40, or 50, or 60 years of hard work, that they really planned to pass down to their children, or their grandchildren, before taxes. We had a tremendous response, and it wasn't just in agriculture. It affects small business. It affected people that had owned real estate in New York city for 50, or 60, or 70 years. And they were going to have to pass that down, and probably have to sell it, to do that. So, it's a topic that people rallied around, that we'll do a lot of things, but what I want to pass down to my family, whether it's the business, or whether it's some assets, I highly recommend you find a different approach to get what you're after than that. It really was successful. Chris Edgington: Obviously, the infrastructure bill, we got that done without touching any of the long term tax implications. And it's going to fix things. It's going to fix a lot of things that America is dependent on. Whether it's ports, whether it's locks and dams, whether it's roads and bridges, every state's going to get funds to go after and fix some of their worst issues. Here in Iowa, I thought I saw 400 million was coming here shortly, and then there's a whole bunch more coming behind it, to work on bridges. We rank as one of the poorest state repairs when it comes to bridges. Chris Edgington: But we're going to get locks and dams fixed. And the general consumer maybe forgets that we need the ports, and the locks and dams. They need ports, and locks and dams, just as much as I do, because we have products moving in and out from all over the world. We live in a world economy. We move stuff in and out. It's not just agriculture products. It's electronics. It's consumer goods. It's... the list goes on, and on, and on. And so, having a highly functioning port system, lock and dam system, is actually one of America's biggest strengths. There's very few places in the world that can compete with that infrastructure that we've got, and has been in place. But it needs some repairs. Some of it's been around a long time, and it needs repairs. So, this is a good deal. Jon Doggett: Absolutely. And as we look at these supply chain issues, a lot of them revolve around ports and the ability to move stuff, whether it's down the road, or across the river, or across the ocean. A lot of that got addressed, but we're not going to see that for some time, how that will transpire. It's going to take a year or two, or even three, to get to some of that. But what a great accomplishment to get this done. Jon Doggett: So, I want to go to a conversation you and I had last night. And I want to refer back to your... the fact that you were waiting in line the last couple of days, delivering grain to the elevator. You and I talked about, yesterday, how many things we do that it's hard to communicate to our membership. We're doing so many great things. And you and I both moved up in this organization, started realizing how much stuff was going on. When you're out there with your fellow farmers waiting in the truck to unload your corn, how much of this stuff that we've done this last year, or two, or three, do you think that they know? And what do you wish they knew more of? Chris Edgington: They know some, but I think they could certainly know a lot more about our sustainability efforts. Unless they're really in that world, they've not heard a lot about that. It's been pretty evident what we're doing when it comes to fertilizer. It'd be tough to not pick up a farm magazine and see NCGA's logo slapped all over some article, whether it was your op-ed, or some of the other ones that we're doing with fertilizer, and the press call we had last week. And they're seeing that, but I'm not sure they totally grasp some of the ramifications, because I didn't. Of what some of these tariffs and countervailing duties really mean. There's a lot of discussion last summer on the last topic we had, stepped-up basis. I got a lot of questions from my local people. What are we doing about that? And how can I help? And I've actually had that on the fertilizer issue, as well. What can I do? Chris Edgington: So, the things that my neighbors probably talk about more than anything is either, A, what affects their business, their bottom line, or what affects their family. And obviously, business cost, fertilizer cost, input cost, affect their business, and the taxes affected their family. And so, those are the ones that really get a lot of attention. I would guess it will happen. Chris Edgington: It's not really happened a lot yet, but there'll be discussion about farm bill. That'll start to get pushed out to the rural level. Guys will start asking, \"Are you working on changes? Do you think there'll be changes?\" We're probably going to have another election before we really get the farm bill a long ways down the road. There will be some activity this year, but I'm guessing that we get to the middle of the summer, farm bill's not going to get a lot of press because it'll be about the elections. That's the world we live in. You go every other year where you get a lot done, and then you don't get as much done. And we're in the don't-get-as-much done year. Jon Doggett: It's the getting ready to get something done. And sometimes, that's the hardest part of the job. So, of all of the things this organization does, what do you wish your fellow farmers knew? What are you most proud of? When you look at this organization, and you stand back and say, \"I've been involved in this, and I had a part of this, and I think this is really cool stuff,\" what are the other things that you'd really like your fellow farmers to know about? Chris Edgington: You know, Jon, it doesn't fall probably into any of those categories. But one of the things that I'm really most proud of is, between our grower leaders, between our staff, between our volunteers at the local level, NCGA and Corn are present. They're involved. They're engaged. At the local level. At the state level. At the national level. Whether it's a federal policy meeting, whether it's a tax discussion, whether it's a local water waste problem, corn farmers are engaged. Producers are engaged. We've got almost 40,000 members. We are active. We are vocal at times. Maybe sometimes we need to be more vocal, but we're better than some others. Honestly, it's one of the things I'm probably most proud of is, we are engaged. We are there. It's not about the people that are sitting on the board. They may be a little bit it more engaged than others, but it's the organization as a whole. Chris Edgington: Our staff is extremely engaged. I have to do a testimony this afternoon with the EPA, on WOTUS. And all weekend, Colleen and I are working back and forth because I just couldn't get to three minutes. They don't give you much time to do those. And she put a whole lot of big words in there that were slowing me down. So, we did get it. But you know, she didn't have to do that on the weekend. She could have waited, but she knew that this is important. And that's just an example of just one of our staff that's always engaged. Chris Edgington: Unfortunately, Jon, you and I have talked about this, most of the board is always engaged. We're not very good at disengaging, but we got a whole lot of company. We got 40,000 other members that are almost always engaged, one way or another. And more people that I think will be joining, based on some of the topics we've had to tackle, and some of the press we've been getting on positive effects, especially around the fertilizer deal. But I'm just proud to lead a group of people that want to be engaged. Jon Doggett: It is. It's cool. And you talk about engagement, and the tax deal, the stepped-up basis deal, we've not had the grassroots turn-out like that in years. And you hate to say that people only move when they're threatened, but it was a great effort. And it worked. And we got thousands, and thousands, and thousands of corn farmers to let Congress know that they weren't real happy with this thing. And it was such a nice thing because it shows, hey, our democracy's working a little bit. We all the time say, \"Oh, our democracy is broken.\" This one, I think, you can point to and say, \"This organization led the way to show that democracy can work, but you got to work at it.\" And then there's another saying, that I think you've coined, something about working together? Chris Edgington: Working together works, Jon. We both know that. Dusty Weis: Jon, you alluded earlier to the fact that 2020, 2021, were years that caught us off guard. And so, I don't think anybody is going to say anything so bold as, \"Well, 2022 has to be better than those years.\" And so, we're not saying that. We're not saying that in this podcast. But I think it's very important, as well, to look forward to 2022 and say there are certain things that we've learned over the last year, lessons that we can take into 2022. And there are certain things that we know that we can look forward to, as well. So, question to both of you, then, what have you learned that you're taking forward into the new year? And what's something that you're looking forward to? Chris Edgington: So, you know, one of the things that we've learned is, and I guess I'll take this from a macro viewpoint, people in our organization enjoy working together face to face. We've had some real trials the last couple years. We're going to have some trials again this year. But people are more interested in at least some form of face to face. We saw that last week with action committee meetings where 70, 80% of the people were present in the room. Chris Edgington: The virtuals were also engaged, though. We've gotten much better at that. First time we tried to do that, the people that were virtually connected were like, they thought they were in some sort of vacuum, I think. It didn't seem to work very well. So, technology has speeded up on how do we make that mixed meeting work better. I am looking forward though, to more of the in-person stuff. Chris Edgington: More of the winter conferences are going to happen. People are going to have to be flexible in some of the things that may happen. Whether it's our great meeting, Commodity Classic in New Orleans, where we bring all of our corn grower friends together, along with soybeans, and wheat, and sorghum, and a few other thousand others, that just want to come to a really great trade show and an interesting city. But there'll be some steps we have to take. There'll be some things we have to do. Chris Edgington: There'll be some people upset. They're upset, I think, because they want to get back to doing regular life, as they view it. I'm not sure what regular life is anymore after the last two years, but they just want to get back. And we're not there yet. It may take a little while, but you're going to see people out and about more, which from my standpoint, as a grower, as a producer, is good. People consume a little more if they're out and about. Whether it's ethanol or whether it's food products, if they're able to be out and about, they're a little happier consumer than if they're only sitting at home. Jon Doggett: You know, I'm still hoping that there's a lesson somewhere on how to manage around COVID. It's hard to manage around something that has been so crazy. I mean, just about the time you think, okay, we're going to head back to normal, and then it goes like this, and you have staff, and growers... Jon Doggett: Among the staff, you have a wide spectrum of expectations, concerns. You certainly see that among the growers. And it's hard to manage all of that when you have expectations from each part of that organization, and how to manage that. I think we've learned some lessons. I think we've learned, one, that technology can work. Chris, absolutely right. The first few hybrid meetings we had, you were either in person, or you were on another planet. And now, I think we're getting better at that. I think one of the things looking forward to is, yes, it's important to be in person, but can we open up more opportunities to more people using that technology, and not being afraid of that technology, and finding ways to make it easier. Jon Doggett: And you know, when we got on this podcast an hour ago, we did what we do every time we get on the podcast, is we go to Larry, the great engineer, and he helps us get all of this hooked up. But increasingly, we're all able to do that ourselves. And I think that's really pretty neat. And if we can use this technology... Jon Doggett: You drive down the road. You drive by that farm. You think there's somebody in that farmhouse right now who could add a lot to this organization, but they're only going to have an hour that they can spend, twice a year, or three times a year. How do we tap into that person? And I think the technology, and the things that we've learned through COVID, are going to help us with that. Now we just have to figure out how to find those people and bring them into this organization, and spread it out and get more perspectives, and more new and interesting ideas. Jon Doggett: I think COVID has been a horrible thing, but it has also allowed us to take some looks at how we interact with one another. And I think if we take those tools, we will continue to build on a great organization, to make it even better. Jon Doggett: Well, this has been an interesting conversation, and I thank you, Chris. Chris Edgington, NCGA president, from north-central Iowa. Thanks for joining us, once again, on the podcast. I am NCGA CEO, Jon Doggett.

    "content": "As Washington prepares to debate the reauthorization of the farm bill in 2023, one group of grower leaders is well-positioned as a valuable resource for corn growers and policymakers. The Risk Management and Transportation Action Team (RMTAT) – which oversees much of NCGA’s public-policy work on transportation, the farm safety net and federal taxes – will play an active role in preparing NCGA for the 2023 farm bill. “NCGA will soon roll out key findings from our nationwide risk management survey of fellow corn growers,” said RMTAT Chairman Bill Leigh.” We are also spending time evaluating current farm bill commodity and crop insurance programs, continuing to support strong risk management tools, and looking for areas of improvement. And implementation of disaster assistance will once again be on the team’s agenda for the year.” The team is building off a successful year, which saw historic federal investments in domestic infrastructure. Implementation of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is underway, with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers already announcing allocations this month to repair and update locks for the inland waterways. Keeping a competitive edge for American agriculture will require monitoring and addressing disruptions to the transportation system and supply chains. While corn growers were recently successful at defending against harmful tax increases, the work to protect key tax provisions never stops. The current estate and gift tax exemptions will automatically lower in several years unless addressed by Congress. This year, RMTAT will continue working to protect important provisions in the tax code against current and future threats. RMTAT consists of 13 NCGA grower leaders, including a liaison from the NCGA Board of Directors, 2 state staff and 3 NCGA staff members.",

    "title": "Historic Investment to Repair Nations River Infrastructure",
    "content": "Appropriations from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which passed in 2021 with bipartisan support, will soon be funding upgrades to infrastructure projects important to corn growers. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced today it would allocate $2.2 billion from the infrastructure legislation to repair and update the following locks along the Upper Mississippi River System: Kentucky Lock along the Tennessee River, near Grand Rivers, Kentucky. Montgomery Lock on the Ohio River, 30 miles south of Pittsburgh. Lock and Dam 25 on the Upper Mississippi River, north of St. Louis. Three Rivers Lock along the Ohio River, southwest of Pittsburgh. T.J. O’Brien Lock and Dam along the Illinois River. “Corn growers depend on America’s rivers to import supplies, like fertilizers, which play an important part in planting and harvesting our crops,” said Iowa farmer and NCGA President Chris Edgington. “These rivers are also important in shipping our products to key markets in the U.S. and abroad. When barges are delayed because of problems with aging locks and dams, farmers are economically affected.” Lock and Dam 25 is crucially important Edgington noted, as 60% of America’s corn and soybean exports are transported on the Mississippi River. An aging system – many of the locks were constructed between 1907 and 1936 – has led to delays and closures along the river. Farmers often feel the economic impact of these problems, and the funding will help ensure the river system’s long-term viability. “We are thankful for the efforts of our state corn growers who worked closely with their members of Congress to make this happen,” he said. “NCGA is also appreciative of our congressional allies who made sure this funding was included in the infrastructure plan.”",

    "title": "NCGA Expresses Concern that Proposed Waters of the U.S. Rule Could Extend Federal Regulatory Control of Farmland",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association cautioned EPA on Tuesday about moving forward with a rule that could give the federal government sweeping regulatory power over America’s farmlands. The testimony from Iowa farmer and NCGA President Chris Edgington comes as EPA considers a proposed rule revising the definition of “Waters of the United States,” under the Clean Water Act. The proposed rule would give the federal government leeway to assert jurisdiction over features that are remote from and carry only minor volumes of water to downstream navigable waters. “The Clean Water Act simply does not allow the agencies to insert themselves into local and farmer land-use decisions in the manner that has been proposed,” Edgington said. “There is a limit under the Clean Water Act to the direct federal control over land-use decisions and policies. Such Clean Water Act policy properly respects the roles of each of the principal players in this system: the private landowner, citizen stakeholders, local government, state government, and the federal government.” These reasonable limits give farmers greater certainty when making critical decisions to ensure they can successfully and sustainably produce and market crops, Edgington noted. Edgington expressed support for EPA’s proposal to maintain the decades-old exclusion for prior converted cropland. However, he said he was disappointed the agency is not proposing to carry forward the Navigable Water Protection Rule’s definition of prior converted cropland, which was designed to improve clarity and consistency regarding the implementation of this exclusion. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register in December. The public comment period is now open and will close on February 7, 2022.",

    "title": "New Economic Analysis Has Farmers Raising Concerns about Looming Tariffs on Nitrogen Fertilizers",
    "content": "A new economic analysis released today by researchers at Texas A&M University has corn growers raising concerns that pending tariffs on nitrogen fertilizers will create shortages and cause prices to increase even more for farmers, according to the National Corn Growers Association. “As part of this study, we conducted a historical analysis going back to 1980 and found that fertilizer costs tend to go up when corn revenues increase,” lead researcher Joe Outlaw, Ph.D., noted. “Notably, these prices tend to go up exponentially even after accounting for natural gas prices and higher demand.” The study notes that the price of one type of nitrogen fertilizer, called anhydrous ammonia, increased by $688 per ton – $86,000 for a 1,000-acre farm – from the end of 2020 through the end of October 2021. The study has farmers raising concerns about a petition by CF Industries, one of the country’s major nitrogen producers, with the U.S. International Trade Commission to impose tariffs on nitrogen fertilizers imported from Trinidad & Tobago and Russia. The U.S. Department of Commerce has since released a preliminary finding recommending tariffs, despite strong outcry from farm groups. “The proposed tariffs will create shortages and drive our costs up even higher,” Iowa farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Chris Edgington said. “They will add insult to injury and impose a financial hardship on family farms.” \"This academic study verifies that nitrogen prices erode profitability for family farms,\" Edgington said. “Our request is simple,” he said. “We’re just asking that these companies keep us out of their trade disputes, and they do everything possible to keep their products available and affordable for family farms.” The study was commissioned by state corn organizations in Texas, Missouri, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wisconsin.",

    "title": "Market Development Action Team Focused on Driving Demand in 2022",
    "content": "Exports and animal agriculture make up nearly 70% of annual corn demand. The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) Market Development Action Team (MDAT) portfolio includes these, as well as new uses of corn. The team’s primary goal and focus is to drive demand for America’s corn farmers. “Last fall, we announced the winners of the Consider Corn Challenge III, engaged with our animal ag partners on a variety of projects, and worked with trade industry partners to promote the benefits of corn grown here in the U.S.,” said MDAT Chair and Colorado farmer Troy Schneider. “We are going to build upon our wins from 2021, and continue to make strides in this space in 2022 and beyond. I look forward to seeing what we can get accomplished over the next year.” The team’s 2022 priorities include: Increase demand for U.S. Animal Agriculture domestic demand and exports Support research into corn and corn co-product use within animal feed Identify new & support existing industrial uses of corn Support development of trade policy that opens markets, removes trade barriers, and advances international demand for corn and corn products. “As a corn farmer and livestock producer, being good partners with our animal ag customers is extremely important to me,” said MDAT vice chair and Ohio farmer Dennis Vennekotter. “Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of hosting various international trade delegations to talk about how we sustainably produce our crop. This is why working with organizations like the U.S. Grains Council and U.S. Export Meat Federation is critical to our future growth and success.” Through the Market Development Action team, NCGA actively engages with the U.S. Grains Council (USGC), U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF), U.S.A. Poultry and Egg Export Council (USAPEEC), U.S. Pork Board, U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry and Egg (USRSPE), National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA), Certified Angus Beef, National Pork Board (NPB), MAIZALL, American Feed Industry Association (AFIA), North American Meat Institute (NAMI), National Corn to Ethanol Research Center (NCERC), the Animal Agriculture Alliance, and the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy, Corn Refiners Association, Biotechnology Innovation Organization and Plant Based Products Council.

The survey asks about production practices and data from corn producers. Your response helps ensure corn growers are represented in key research and analysis by USDA. This portion of the survey asks questions about fertilizer, pesticide, cropping practice and technology management. It is important to respond to make sure you are represented in your state. Phase II is primarily conducted by phone and is the best way for USDA to get the information it needs to make sure your operation is counted. Corn producers in Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, North Carolina, New York, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Colorado, and Texas have been contacted to participate in the survey.

    "title": "USDA Announces Details for Pace Coverage",
    "content": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture today released the details and coverage of the new crop insurance Post Application Coverage Endorsement, or PACE, for non-irrigated corn. Farmers in select counties in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin are eligible for the endorsement. PACE, available to farmers who split-apply nitrogen, provides coverage for the projected yield lost when producers are unable to apply the post nitrogen application during the V3-V10 corn growth stages due to field conditions created by weather. It is available as supplemental coverage for Yield Protection (YP), Revenue Protection (RP), and Revenue Protection with Harvest Price Exclusion (RP-HPE) policies. “PACE is an important addition to the risk management toolbox for corn growers,” said National Corn Growers Association President Chris Edgington. “We are appreciative of our industry partners and the Risk Management Agency for working to develop and deliver this new crop insurance product. ” Growers who split-apply nitrogen apply fertilizer multiple times throughout the year, rather than providing just one treatment at the beginning of the growing season. The practice helps prevent runoff and leaching of nutrients in the waterways and the groundwater. PACE was developed by the Illinois Corn Growers Association, National Corn Growers Association, Ag-Analytics Technology Company, LLC, Meridian Institute and others submitted to the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation under provisions in the law allowing for private development of new crop products. The first sales closing date to purchase insurance is March 15, 2022. Learn more.",

    "title": "NCGA to EPA: Renewable Fuel Standard Important to Farmers, Helps Lower Emissions",
    "content": "Timely implementation of meaningful Renewable Fuels Standard volumes provides certainty in agriculture markets, reduces emissions and lowers fuel prices, NCGA told U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials today during the agency’s public hearing on proposed RFS volume standards for 2022 and 2021 and proposed reconsideration of 2020 volumes. “Corn farmers produce low-carbon feedstock for low-carbon ethanol, offering immediate and affordable emissions reductions and a vital pathway for agriculture to help address climate change,” NCGA President Chris Edgington told EPA. “But our success helping you meet these commitments depends on EPA sending a clear and firm message that volume requirements will be enforced.” Edgington urged EPA to move quickly to finalize the strong 2022 volume proposal and the denial of pending RFS waiver petitions, actions that would put more clean fuels in the market and repair RFS integrity. He also told EPA that proposed retroactive cuts to 2020 volumes would undermine the 2022 proposal and reward the use of more oil in place of cleaner renewables, asking the agency to avoid the precedent of reopening final volumes. “As EPA finalizes and enforces the delayed 2022 RFS volumes and puts the RFS on track, we ask you to work with us to achieve greater emission reductions and cleaner air through use of more renewable, sustainable, affordable ethanol,” said Edgington. Edgington’s full testimony can be found here.",

    "title": "Corn Growers to Mosaic: Stop Engaging in Irresponsible Corporate Behavior and End Fertilizer Tariffs",
    "content": "One of the nation’s leading fertilizer companies has erected an insurmountable tariff barrier to keep its top competitors out of the U.S. market at the expense of America’s farmers, according to a letter released this week by the National Corn Growers Association. Leaders from NCGA and its state affiliates signed the letter, which was sent to executives at Mosaic Co., one of the nation’s largest fertilizer producers. The letter takes Mosaic to task for the tariffs that were imposed in March by the U.S. International Trade Commission at the fertilizer company’s behest. Fertilizer prices have since skyrocketed. “Mosaic’s posture to date has been a masterpiece of irresponsible corporate social responsibility,” the letter says. The letter highlighted the stranglehold Mosaic has placed on its customers and suggested the company’s monopoly is creating serious problems for farmers. “…only 15% of phosphorous imports now come into the U.S. without tariffs,” the letter notes. “And experts say that using Commerce and ITC to manipulate the supply curve does indeed dictate price to farmers.” To illustrate their point, the signatories said estimates show that tariffs between 30% and 70% on phosphate imports would equate to roughly $480 to $640 million in added fertilizer bills on U.S. farmers. The corn growers said that now is a good time for Mosaic to reverse course. “We ask that you voluntarily withdraw your countervailing duties and allow critical supply back into the U.S. at a time of inadequate supplies and soaring phosphate prices,” they said. In recent months, NCGA and state corn growers have sounded the alarm about the effects fertilizer tariffs are having on farmers. NCGA, along with other ag groups, submitted an amicus brief in November in a case filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade seeking to overturn the tariffs. A ruling in that case is not expected any earlier than summer of 2022.",

    "title": "Corn Yield Contest Reflects Resilience of Corn and Farmers Who Grow It",
    "content": "Corn growers showed the amazing possibilities open to agriculture with the use of modern seed varieties, advanced production techniques and innovative growing practices this year as David Hula topped the 600 bushel-per-acre mark again this year in NCGA’s National Corn Yield Contest. Hula, of Charles City, Virginia, repeated his accomplishment and produced the highest yield in the contest with 602.1694 bushels per acre. These great yields, which have been achieved nationwide despite many challenges, reflect farmers' resilience and deep dedication to continuous improvement. The National Corn Yield Contest is now in its 57th year and remains NCGA’s most popular program for members. “This contest offers farmers a chance to come together both for good-natured competition and to help innovate the future of our industry,” said Lowell Neitzel, chair of NCGA’s Member and Consumer Engagement Action Team. “These contestants grow to be leaders in many other ways as well. For many, the contest may be their first interaction with NCGA. As they learn more, the true value of the work that we do to build a better tomorrow inspires greater achievement. Whether getting involved in advocacy, leadership or sustainability efforts, the contest breeds champions for corn farmers in many arenas.” The 27 national winners in 9 production categories had verified yields averaging more than 376.7593 bushels per acre, compared to the projected national average of 177 bushels per acre nationwide. While there is no overall contest winner, yields from first, second and third place farmers overall production categories averaged 285.5971 bushels per acre. For more than half a century, NCGA’s National Corn Yield Contest has provided corn growers with the opportunity to compete with their colleagues to grow the most corn per acre, helping feed and fuel the world. This has given participants not only the recognition they deserved but the opportunity to learn from their peers. Winners receive national recognition in publications such as the NCYC Corn Yield Guide, as well as trips or other awards from participating sponsoring seed, chemical and crop protection companies. Winners will be honored in March of 2022 during Commodity Classic in New Orleans, Louisiana. Please visit the National Corn Growers Association NCYC for the complete list of 2021 National and State winners, including the list of all 2021 NCYC entrants.",

    "title": "EP. 27 - Bipartisanship Revisited, with Congressional Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) and Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.)",
    "content": "A Democrat and a Republican work together for reason and compromise in our national politics. Bipartisanship is how things get done in Washington, and what holds us together as Americans. So how’s that going in our nation’s capital? “Things are not good, from a bipartisan perspective right now,” Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson from South Dakota tells us in this episode. And Democrat Abigail Spanberger from Virginia agrees. As members of the bipartisan “Problem Solvers’ Caucus,” these two Congresspeople have developed a reputation for trying to work together instead of tear one another down. But they can’t do it alone. And so in this episode, they join us once again to discuss how Americans can help bring compromise back, and why it’s important for the corn industry. Direct Share Link Rep. Abigail Spanberger: I value bipartisanship. It's being intentional with the desire to say, \"I don't need you to agree with everything I'm about to say, but I want to have a discussion about this.\" Rep. Dusty Johnson: We need more citizens to be actively engaged in this process. They need to invest in media sources and in institutions and in candidates that are responsible. If they're only relying on news that preys on fear and anger, they're doing it wrong. Dusty Weis: Hello and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host, Association CEO Jon Doggett. From the fields of the corn belt to the DC beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: Bipartisanship. It's how things get done in Washington, and it's what holds us together as a nation. And yet today we're going to talk to two members of Congress who say bipartisanship is at an all time low. Republican Dusty Johnson from South Dakota and Democrat Abigail Spanberger from Virginia are two elected reps who are actively trying to change that on Capitol Hill, but they can't do it alone. So in this episode, how Americans can help bring compromise back, and what it means for the corn industry. But if you haven't yet make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also make sure you follow NCGA on Twitter @nationalcorn, and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. Dusty Weis: And with that, it's time to once again introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association, and Jon, we are very pleased for the first time to welcome back two returning guests to the podcast. Although so much has happened since the last time that we spoke, it kind of feels like actual years have gone by since then. Jon Doggett: Well Dusty, it was March 12th, 2020, just hours before the world went on lockdown. We met with Representatives Dusty Johnson of South Dakota and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. And we talked about bipartisanship in Representative Spanberger's office in the Longworth House office building on Capitol Hill. And it was one of the last in-person meetings that took place in a congressional office building before we got locked down with COVID. So world's a much different place now, and just think about where we've been since then. We didn't know what social distancing meant. We didn't know what a Zoom call was. The tiger king was an inmate serving time for conspiracy to commit murder in a Texas prison. Dusty Weis: I didn't even know that much, Jon, at that point, and I was happier for it. Jon Doggett: You were happier for it. So for all the ways that our world has changed since then, and it's changed a lot, one thing remains the same, unfortunately. We're still a politically divided country, maybe even more divided than we were back then. So in this episode, we're going to revisit that same conversation with these same two wonderful members of Congress to see what we can do to find out more about that precious common ground that connects us. Two members of Congress from two different parties, talking about how they can get along and get something done for the country. So you've been on the program before, but I'd like both of you to take a moment to talk a little bit about yourselves, talk about the people you represent in Washington DC, and Congresswoman Spanberger, we're going to start with you. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: Excellent. Thank you so much for having me on the podcast. It's always a pleasure to be here with my colleague, Dusty Johnson. And I do remember very fondly that day when we all gathered in my office, I did not realize it was right as the world was shutting down. I guess there was sort of a pivot where time basically lost all meaning, but I represent Virginia's 7th congressional district. It is a long skinny district through central Virginia, and I have a majority rural community, agricultural community by land mass, but majority suburban by population numbers. My district to the northern portion is a lot of rolling hills, horse country, significant greenhouses, some really interesting farms that do specialty crops, great history of family farms. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: And all throughout my district, more towards the center portion of my long skinny district, we've got a pretty significant and important cattle industry and forestry and the southern portion of my district we've got a bit more row crops. And again, it's a long skinny district, not nearly as big as Dusty's, and then to the east of the rural communities, agricultural communities I represent, we have heavily suburban communities that encircle the city of Richmond. Virginia as a state, our number one, private industry is agriculture, then tourism and then forestry. So people may not always think of Virginia if you're not from Virginia as being such an incredibly important agricultural state, but we truly are. It's our history, and it is so foundational to our communities, particularly those that I represent. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: I was elected in 2018, when Dusty was elected, and proudly serve on the agriculture committee as the only Virginian. Although I guess Dusty can say the same, the only South Dakotan on the agriculture committee. As the only Virginian on the agriculture committee, I take that as a major point of pride and claim all of the things that Virginia has to offer between aquaculture, our peanut industry, and not to mention the agriculture that's really present within my district. So good to be with you again, and thanks for having us on. Jon Doggett: You bet. Thank you. Congressman. Rep. Dusty Johnson: Yeah, thanks for having me back again. I grew up in a large working class family in South Dakota and listen, it's a great state. I can't speak about it quite as poetically as Abigail spoke about her district, they should put her on commercials. But South Dakota, corn is king in eastern South Dakota. An overwhelming majority of the farmland is a corn bean rotation. And listen, people really love what they do. You guys understand the incredible cultural impact of those family farms. West River, South Dakota is a lot of forestry and we have the beautiful Black Hills of South Dakota out there. Rep. Dusty Johnson: I would just note that think South Dakotans, regardless of where they follow on the political spectrum, not universally, but I think overwhelmingly, appreciate a kind of practicality when it comes to politics. They understand that politics is the art of the possible and that it needs to be about addition and multiplication rather than about subtraction and division. And in that way, I'm honored to represent them. I think with Abigail and Dusty, this Dusty, maybe the other Dusty too, but at least with Dusty Johnson, I think you get a couple of workhorses rather than show horses. And, oh my goodness, wouldn't I love to have fewer show horses in the US House. Jon Doggett: Amen. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: I motion to second that. Jon Doggett: All right, so on a very serious, real journalism note. Congressman Johnson, we're going to start with you. What show or shows did you find yourself binge watching to forget about the pandemic for a moment? Rep. Dusty Johnson: I was told there would be no difficult questions, Jon, on this podcast. First I will note, I neglected to dimension cattle and livestock in western South Dakota. And that is a grievous error that I needed to correct right there. But as far as binging, it's sort of all Office all the time. It's such a great show and it holds up. It's pretty cringy, but I think the humor holds up pretty well. Lupin, Netflix show out of France, just a great suspense show. And then I enjoy older gritty movies like Apocalypse Now or Blade Runner, so those were pandemic watching as well. Jon Doggett: Congresswoman? Rep. Abigail Spanberger: I did watch Tiger King with the rest of America. My children all- Rep. Dusty Johnson: Carole Baskin killed her husband. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: I also embarked on a bit of a movie watching escapade. I have three daughters. They are now 7, 10 and 13. And so they wanted to watch every Marvel movie in the order in which they were produced. So that was a bit of a family endeavor that I mostly joined them for. Rep. Dusty Johnson: Are they any good? Of course the ones with Chris Evans are great, but other than those are any of them any good? Rep. Abigail Spanberger: Also, I want to maintain the positive relationship I have with my 10 year old daughter who is a Marvel fan. So I'm going to say they're amazing, every single one, and every minute I've spent watching Marvel movies have just brought such delight to my life. So yes, when we made it through that, I recently watched Ted Lasso, which I thought was just a delightful, delightful show, and I see a lot of depth to it that perhaps was not intended, but it brings me great joy, thinking of the kind of role of a joyful American on the world stage trying to bring people together, seen as being a little bit goofy at times, but always with positive intent. Whether it was intended to be a metaphor for who we are as American people or not, I'm going to perceive it as such and go with it. Jon Doggett: Congresswoman, I'm so glad you brought that up because I talked to a good friend of mine early this morning and she said, you remind me of Ted Lasso. And fortunately it was a phone call rather than in person, so she didn't see the blank look on my face. So I did have to go and look it up and I'm going to take it as a compliment, but I'm not good with modern culture at times. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: She might also mean, I don't know, do you have a tendency to use phrases and expressions that sometimes leave people scratching their heads often, with maybe animal references or sayings that people have to sort of think, what did that mean? Dusty Weis: A little bit of rural folksiness in Jon Doggett? Nah, nah. Jon Doggett: Yeah, a little bit of Montana ranch kid. My dad had a lot of expressions that were not always the kinds that you could probably use on a show like this. So we'll kind of avoid some of those, but yeah. So let's talk a little bit about bipartisanship and again, this was such a welcome podcast a couple years ago, and people just really ate up the fact that hey, we've got folks that actually can talk to one another and be civil with one another. So bipartisanship is more a journey than it is a destination. And if that's true, where are we right now? And how has that changed since we last talked? Rep. Abigail Spanberger: You know, I think by of partisanship is also a choice journey, destination, all of those things. It's also a choice. And I think in the past year there's been a lot of discussion about what's the point or what does it mean? And so I have spent time discussing with my constituents or people I represent, or frankly, colleagues that I value bipartisanship because I value the creation of broad coalitions. And frankly, that's not always bipartisan as in Democrats and Republicans, sometimes it's within the scope of our own parties. It's bringing people to a discussion who might not naturally have shown up at that discussion. It's being intentional with a desire to say, I don't need you to agree with everything I'm about to say, but I want to have a discussion about this. And in the legislating space, that's okay, this is a priority that I want to work on. Where can we come to some agreement on this? Where might we be able to partner? Rep. Abigail Spanberger: So Dusty and I work on a lot of different issues legislatively because we both work on the Ag Committee because we also have some similar priorities, but we certainly don't agree on everything and that's fine. We don't need to agree on everything, but we certainly agree on issues related to livestock production and supply chain issues and telehealth priorities. And maybe we don't always agree even there on how we want to better the system or legislate in a way that's supposed to meaningfully impact our constituents, but we have found and sought out places where we know that things could be better or we can through our role as legislators do good work. And so then it becomes a question of what is that good work. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: I think that those conversations and any effort at bipartisanship, or even just talking with anybody who's of a different mindset and in our realm, in our day to day that's politics. In our day to day, that's Democrats, Republicans, occasionally an Independent. In other people's realms, it's somebody who lives in a rural community or somebody who lives in a suburban community. One of the most kind of noteworthy stories I've ever heard from a constituent, I've heard many incredible stories from a constituent, but I had a dairy farmer in one of the communities I represent talking about how he was at a Home Depot. He was buying a swing set for his child and it was in the suburban community. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: He had driven across the county line, not that far, about a 20 minute drive to the Home Depot, he was buying a swing set and while he's sitting there talking to the young woman who worked at the store, she asked him what he did for a job. And he said, I'm a farmer. And her reaction was one of great surprise. And he made a joke about like, I guess she expected to see overalls or a typical farmer wear when I'm out at home Depot, but I'm at Home Depot buying a swing set. I'm not going to wear with the clothes I wear when I'm out with my cows. And I remember it being so interesting because these people live about 20 minutes apart and this woman's reaction was so notable that he again recounted it sometime later to me, but it speaks in my mind to the divisions and in this case, not necessarily a negative one, but the divisions or the lack of understanding where just that sometimes exists within our communities. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: And so there should to be an intentionality. And I think it's helpful to have an intentionality with trying to understand people of different perspectives, different life experiences, different origins, different childhoods, all of it. And in the day to day that becomes political. But there's such a space where we can learn from other people, where we can try to do right by people, and I remain focused on it because the way that we actually make meaningful impact in the communities that we represent in the country that Dusty and I choose to serve is by building broader coalitions. And when Congress is represented by Democrats, Republicans, and a couple of Independents, those coalitions should, and oftentimes need to include people across party lines. Rep. Dusty Johnson: If the question is what's the status of bipartisanship, because I think a lot of what Abigail said was very, very artfully said, but things are not good from a bipartisan perspective right now. Jon, you alluded to the fact that they may be worse. And I think that is an unfortunate but accurate diagnosis. And we could spend a lot of time probably apportioning out blame and that's not my interest, of course. Almost certainly everybody has their share of blame and then some, but I would just note this, because I think maybe we'll talk a little bit about January 6th and that clearly I think was an impediment to feelings of goodwill toward the other party. Probably more on how folks on Abigail's side view Republicans. And so then I'll talk about the frustration also from the Republicans as they view Democrats. And again, this is not to apportion blame, but we're a very closely divided country. Rep. Dusty Johnson: I mean I think Speaker Pelosi has four or five votes to spare in the House. The Senate is literally 50 50. And I think in that sort of an environment, you would hope it would be tailor made to have all of the solutions to the major issues that vex our country be overwhelmingly common ground based, trying to thread the needle carefully between the camps of this closely divided nation. And we don't have to necessarily diagnose why, but I think almost everybody would acknowledge that that has not been the case, and that the solutions to the major problems have been far more one party based. And I think that has elevated frustration on the side of the Republicans. And so to sum up Jon, where we're at right now, Abigail's right, this is a choice and it's an important choice for people to make even when it's not easy to make it. Rep. Dusty Johnson: But the frustration, the Democrats are really, really upset at the Republicans. The Republicans are really, really upset at the Democrats. The entire environment, rewards, rancor, and toxicity and one party solutions. And so it is really difficult. I'll be honest. It's really difficult for those of us who believe in bridge building and common ground. It's harder today for us to conduct our work. Now to try to put a brighter end on it, I would tell you that I think bipartisanship and positivity in politics is a supply problem. It's not a demand problem. The American people want this and we just need to continue to make sure that good people get elected and that they feel the same passion for this work that we do. But it isn't easy. So if any of your listeners pray, I would ask that they say a little prayer because for a lot of us, this work has grown more difficult than it had been. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: Yeah. I gave a little bit of a cheery ideal of bipartisanship, but I do want to agree with everything that Dusty just said. It is far more challenging here on Capitol Hill than it was in our first term. There's a gulf at times between parties. And I think some of the rancor is newsworthy. Some of the rancor garners engagement. So people are incentivized in a really negative way to fight or to be vocal with their disagreements. And I've always been the person, and I think Dusty's falls in this category as well, that I don't want to have a fight with someone. I want to understand someone and I want to come to some sort of ultimate solution, but it's a really challenging time here. But our constituents wanted it. Dusty Weis: Representative Spanberger and Representative Johnson, from your positions, you serve in the Problem Solvers Caucus, where you join one Republican, one Democrat at a time. And that's certainly been the source of a lot of your friendship and cooperation as well. But as Representative Johnson said, this is not a demand side problem. This is a supply side problem. And so as two Representatives who are willing to work with people from the other side, what else can you do? And what else do you do in Washington to facilitate less rancor? Each of you gets face time from time to time with party leadership. Do you ever have the opportunity in your day to day affairs to talk to party leadership and say whoa, hey guys, can we dial it back a little bit? Jon Doggett: I think the Congresswoman has been noted for being rather direct with her leadership. And I think I remember a quote that came out of a meeting that you were rather eloquent in saying hey, we need to head towards the middle a little bit on some things, which I think was a wonderful piece of bravery on your part. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: Thank you, Jon. And I appreciate you somewhat euphemistically, gently acknowledging I was perhaps, shall we call it terse or colorful in the ways I express myself? I'll be very honest. I try to have these conversations. I think that there exists a problem where I'm going to deal with both sides. Dusty, if you disagree with me, let me know. I think that leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle, leadership on the Republican side of the aisle, in both the House and Senate at times from the front row seat, I can view it at times as a observer watching television like the rest of America. I think there is an absence of trust that exists between leaders that is so significant and severe that even when someone like me or someone like Dusty or any of the others who are really trying to move forward with good bipartisan legislation, put a focus on that. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: It can at times be difficult to overcome the lack of trust that was potentially years in the making, but has made it so that we've arrived at a place where motivations are always questioned, I think on both sides of the aisle. And then to be very clear, we have a small Democratic majority. There's significant desire on the other side of the aisle to see that flip. And so between the fact that rancor gets attention and potentially fighting is a part and parcel of the electoral process that would put one party in power or the other. I think that the benefit that I have a little bit different, I think, for Dusty, is I represent a district that has a very big mix of voters. I'm a Democrat, I'm the first Democrat elected in my district since 1968. So I represent a lot of people who agree with me. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: I represent a lot of people who disagree with me and on any given day, I'm making somebody somewhere not happy with me back home in my district. And there's something pretty freeing in the fact that any day of the week, somebody's going to be mad at me, so I get to do what I think is right and I get to do what I promised to do, and I get to prioritize what I think are the principles that will do good things for my constituents in Virginia. But other people that may be in districts that are more skewed towards more party alignment extremes, the conversations become very different. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: I think that for some of our counterparts who can go a week or a month and never encounter someone who talks to them as a constituent of the other party or different ideological positioning, be they a Democrat in a strong Democratic district or a Republican in a strong Republican district, you can become disconnected from the fact that there are so many ideas across this country and that if I'm representing my district well, I'm hearing and responding to the opinions of people who are naturally inclined to disagree with me because of their historic party affiliation or who outright completely and totally disagree with me, as well as the ones who agree with me and may or may not have voted for me. So I think some of the structures that exist make it really difficult for not just party leadership to rebuild that trust, but also for some members who are from districts very different from mine to see the value in hearing various ideas, because they may not be as prevalent back home in their districts. Rep. Dusty Johnson: Yeah. I think there's a pretty substantial cultural difference between Abigail's caucus and my conference. And I think you see that in how members interact with leadership. The Republicans, they ran out Speaker Gingrich. They ran out Speaker Boehner. They were preparing to run Speaker Paul Ryan. The Republican caucus or conference rather, doesn't do a very good job of being deferential to leadership. Now, maybe that's a strength, maybe that's a weakness. It probably depends on the day. But what Speaker Pelosi has done is absolutely remarkable in modern political times. You will never have a Republican be the head of our group for that long, as long as she has been. Rep. Dusty Johnson: So if the question is to what extent have I delivered those messages to leadership, I have, but one of the heads of the French revolution, Jon, said, \"There go the people and I must follow them for, I am their leader.\" And I think to be a leader within the Republican conference these days really requires very much in touch of what the conference values and views are, because that conference is always agitating to throw you out of that position. And so I have never had the sense that I'm working for Kevin McCarthy. I think he really presents more of the sense that he's working for us. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: If I may say, as someone who did not vote for the Speaker of the House, not once, not twice, I work for the people of the seventh district, if I may just add that. Rep. Dusty Johnson: Right. Although I think a lot of observers would indicate that Speaker Pelosi seems to have ... Control isn't maybe the right word, but I think more of an ability to move her caucus more quickly than perhaps McCarthy can do with his conference. So the reason I mentioned that, Jon, is that I've delivered that message to leadership, but frankly it is not a message that they're getting from an overwhelming number of the members of the Republican conference. And I can lament how unfortunate that is, but when I try to talk to my colleagues in this sort of hand to hand rationale they would say, \"Wait a second, we had a $2 trillion COVID package shoved down our throats with nary a bipartisan discussion. We had Build Back Better done in a similar way. Now, Dusty, now you want me to listen to you about how we need to do?\" Rep. Dusty Johnson: Because Abigail and I've worked together on livestock issues time and time again. And she's really been a wonderful ally in those areas. But when I talk to my colleagues about some of these smaller singles and doubles that are bipartisan basis, it's hard when the triples and home runs have been predominantly one party solutions for me to convince leadership that a totally different mindset is required for the singles and doubles. It doesn't mean that it's not work worth doing. It just is acknowledging the difficulty in doing so. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: And on the other side of the aisle, people say, \"Well, they wouldn't join us for this bill and for this bill and for this bill. So then why are they going to join us on the singles and doubles?\" And the message is exactly the same, just the inverse. And not to mention, and this is of course, before you and I got here, Dusty, but then it's \"Well, when they had the majority they did. Rep. Dusty Johnson: Exactly. Exactly. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: They didn't work with us then. Rep. Dusty Johnson: And really, neither Abigail nor I doubt very much that when the Republicans seize back the house, whenever that is, that there will not be this return of harmony and beauty and calmity. We just know we're in a really difficult environment. Jon Doggett: Well, you know, my wife and I have raised two kids and we have two granddaughters and I got to spend some time with them over Thanksgiving and they're six and eight. And to convince them that, \"Hey guys, if you remember every single thing that your sister did that you didn't like, guess what? She's going to remember everything that you didn't like.\" And we seem so consumed in this country, particularly in Washington, but across the country, and let's find somebody to blame because I certainly can't be responsible. And I think that's the problem is we abdicate our responsibility when all we do is find blame with whoever disagrees with us. And it's so frustrating. And that's why it's important for us to come back to this conversation. Because again, it's been one that my membership has said, \"Hey, can we have more of that? Can we please see more of that?\" And I think that's something that we need now more than ever and certainly now more than we did when we last talked in March of 2020. Rep. Dusty Johnson: And Jon, if Abigail was perhaps a little too rosy to kick it off, I've probably been a little too cynical in my last two answers. And so cattle in this country eat a lot of corn. So I think this is very on point with the overall podcast. Abigail and I were leaders on a cattle contract library that passed out of the Ag Committee a few weeks ago, unanimously. And there's a pretty good shot that we'll be able to get that through the House by the end of the year. That's remarkable. That will provide unprecedented transparency into the cattle markets, which have increasingly migrated from the sale barn to alternative marketing agreements. And is that going to lead the 6:00 news? No. Will Cuomo or Carlson spend 15 minutes on it on their shows? No, but I do think that for people who are serious policy makers, like I think we try to be, the fact that we're getting that done even in an environment that doesn't seem to value it very much, I think should give your listeners a little bit of a feeling of goodwill. Jon Doggett: What we'd like is a little bit more of man bites dog kind of story. Rep. Dusty Johnson: Right. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: Well, and it matters. The bottom line is it matters. It matters to the cattlemen across Virginia, it matters to the cattlemen in South Dakota. It's impactful legislation if you are impacted by it. And I think that that gets at the heart of what we try to do is find places where we can have impact on the people we represent and Americans across the board, and do it. And maybe there are going to be downstream consequences of a positive nature for folks who are buying beef in the grocery store. You don't have to have a cattle farm to be wholly impacted. You don't have to be the corn grower feeding the cattle to be wholly impacted. But these are things that are going to go unseen and unnoticed unless you are directly impacted. But for those who are impacted directly, it's really important. Jon Doggett: So tomorrow I will be heading to Montana and I'll be on the family ranch the day after that. And on behalf of my family, thanks to both of you for doing what you did. It has been noticed at least by my family. And I don't want you to ever think that some folks aren't noticing the good things you're doing, we just need to make sure or that we do more to point that out. Rep. Dusty Johnson: It's all good and well for us to identify that there's a problem, that bipartisanship is more difficult today than it should be. If I was a listener, I'd want to, oh, no, okay, so what? What is the call to action? If bipartisanship is a supply problem and not a demand problem, then I think we need more citizens to be actively engaged in this process. They need to invest in media sources and in institutions and in candidates that are responsible. If they're only relying on news that preys on fear and anger, they're doing it wrong. They need to find reasonable sources of information. If they're only sending $15 donations to candidates that yell and scream and get upset and call the other side of the aisle traitors day in and day out, they are doing it wrong. And so I think the call to action is this week, before the end of the week is done, think about how you in a modest but important way can invest in an institution, a media source, or a candidate that tries to be responsible. Jon Doggett: And I've said on this podcast a number of times, if you're looking at voting for somebody that says they're going to go to Washington and fight and fight, don't elect that person and then say, why can't they get anything done in Washington? Rep. Abigail Spanberger: They should go to Washington to work, work. Jon Doggett: And listen. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: And thank you for validating me, Jon, because on the campaign side everybody loves to talk about all the things that they're fighting for and fighting about and fighting over. And whenever I would review any sort of copy coming out of my campaign side, I would always say it's working for things. Jon Doggett: Well, I think Congressman Johnson had the best line last time. And that was scooch don't yell. Dusty Weis: Scooch. Don't yell. Did you ever print out those bumper stickers? Rep. Dusty Johnson: Did I say that? I have no recollection of that. Jon Doggett: Oh, you're on tape, Congressman. I'm sorry, but we got you, we got you cold on this one. Dusty Weis: And here comes the part where we replay that tape in the finished version of this now. Rep. Dusty Johnson: Rather than just run these people down on Twitter, if we can scooch a little bit, this is how we can actually get it done. You don't get as many headlines having private coffee as you do going on cable news, but you make a lot more progress that way. Jon Doggett: So scooch don't yell. Rep. Dusty Johnson: Yeah. Right. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: Sounds like a bumper sticker. Dusty Weis: The idea being that there should always be some room to scooch instead of yelling at one another. Jon Doggett: Oh yes. Rep. Dusty Johnson: Well, listen, I am eloquent so often it's hard to remember the line by line. Jon Doggett: Oh, all right. So Congresswoman Spanberger, I live in the district just north of her and we've been treated for some months now with a whole barrage of election ads because we have the off year election in Virginia, but next year we're going to have another election and it's kind of a big one and elections have a tendency to bring out the worst in us. I look at all those ads that I saw from all those candidates in Virginia. I didn't see a single one where somebody said, \"Yeah, I want to get elected, because I want to do this because I think it's important for our state.\" So how can we help each other not go and do that this time around? How can we make these elections better? And I think Congressman Johnson, you started that thought and I think it was a good one, is we got to be better followers if we're going to find better leaders. Rep. Dusty Johnson: Well, and I'll give Abigail kudos. It is often difficult to hold your colleagues accountable, but there have been two occasions on which I can remember in Problem Solvers Caucus meetings, where she has just said, \"Hey, listen, we have got to be responsible for the way in which we campaign. You cannot run television ads or Facebook ads talking about your opponent as a vile human being, and the other party is evil and then expect to walk into this room and convince us to work with you.\" And I think it's an incredibly effective message. And it's something that not just the 58 members of the Problem Solvers Caucus need to hear and believe and live, but we've got a lot of others who, the way they campaign is, it degrades the American experience and it is unworthy of this great Republic. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: Thank you for the kind words, Dusty. This is something that I think is a really hard, but also just incredibly easy question to answer. You know, campaigns are tough. You're saying vote for me because I am better for these reasons or I've done these things and I will do these things and that person has not done these things or they've in fact, voted against these things, or they would vote against these things. And back to Dusty's last comment about people need to also take ownership of where they seek their information and their messages. And anger drives people. Anger is an emotion that is motivating in a way that's perhaps more motivating than, \"Oh, well, that's great.\" Rep. Abigail Spanberger: If you see an ad on television and you think, \"Oh, well, that's really good. That's a very interesting priority that they're working on,\" you're not amped up. You're not calling your friends and posting on Facebook and getting so amped up to the fact that you're motivated by anger, by fear. Motivating people by anger and fear, unfortunately, tragically works, which is why people continue to do it. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: Again, going back to my district, I'm going to be a tough campaigner. I'm going to tell people all the reasons why I am representing my district well, why I am working harder than anybody else would in this district, why I believe in the work that I'm doing and I'm going to make an argument for the things that I've supported. Richmond has a really inexpensive media market, so I also put a lot of TV commercials up to highlight all the things that I'm doing, because I want people to vote for me. Very candidly. I want them to be eyes wide open about who my opponents are, so that they can be eyes wide open about them, but then also feel that they can say why I am voting for someone. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: And in the comments that you referenced that I made before our caucus, that was my whole point. Let's tell people what we're for. If we believe that our ideas are good and our policies are important and worthy of pursuit, then let's talk about them. Because frankly, if we're not talking about them, then what's the point? And the anger and the division, it does another thing, which I think is incredibly detrimental to our democracy. If you turn on the television and all it is just anger, anger, anger, anger, anger, and be it on the news, or be it in campaign ads or be it wherever you may find, people turn away from that. People, they stop watching the news, they want to separate themselves, politics is terrible, all politicians are awful. All of the superlatives that are not in any way a positive reflection of, I think, the job or the duty that Dusty or I want to pursue here on Capitol Hill. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: Then when you have people turn away from it, the people who end up staying are the ones who want to be driven by that anger, by that fear, by that negative emotion. And the people who say like, \"I just want y'all to work together. I just want you to fix it. I elected you to do a job. I have a job. I have kids, I have this. I don't want to be the Representative. I don't want to know everything about everything. That's why I hired you with my vote.\" And when politics and the day to day becomes so angry and divisive, it's people of that mentality that are the first ones to turn away. And I think that our democracy writ large is stronger and better when people are engaged. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: And when we're able to say, \"Well, that Dusty Johnson. Boy, I agreed with them on this and I disagreed with him on that but blah, blah, blah, blah. I went to his town hall,\" and that's an appropriate response to somebody that you might agree with or disagree with. I don't agree with my husband 100% of the time and I'm happily married. You're not going to agree with your elected Representative 100% of the time, and if that's your expectation, then you're going to be sadly and sorely disappointed. But you should be able to know enough about what they're doing and what they're working for that you say, \"Yeah, I like what they're working for or I don't, and I'm going to decide accordingly.\" But this real anger, the incentives are just so profound, but also perverse. And that's why a lot of people who just want to see government work step away from it all. Jon Doggett: I'm going to ask you each one sentence. What can voters do to make this a better election and Congressman Johnson, I'll go with you first. Rep. Dusty Johnson: Vote for candidates that do not prey on your fear and anger. Jon Doggett: Congresswoman? Rep. Abigail Spanberger: Spend a little bit of time reading about what your candidates or what your elected Representatives have done. Listen to them. And to Dusty's point, vote for the ones that are focused on being productive and telling you what they will do and what they will focus on, and not who they're not in an effort to vilify the other side across the board. Jon Doggett: To watch the two of you interact, and it's very clear that you like one another, you respect one another, you work well together, it's so refreshing to see that. But it's kind of sad because it seems like it's all so, so rare and becoming more so. So please let us know anytime, how could we help you guys make relationships like yours in Washington to be more normal than they are rare? And you're right, there is more of a demand than supply, what we need to do is we have some of these problems with supply chains right now. Maybe this is another place that we need to work on. Rep. Dusty Johnson: Yes, I would call out the bill by Democrat John Garamendi of California and Republican Dusty Johnson of South Dakota that would address the supply chain problems. And I do want to say one more thing because you said let us know what you can do to help us. I mean, let's just take a minute to call out corn as a national organization that does not feed into anger or fear and consistently tries to articulate good policy, regardless of whether it was thought up by a Republican or a Democrat. Or regardless of who holds the gavel in one committee or the other, you all should take tremendous pride in how you navigate these political waters focused on policy and good government. Jon Doggett: Thank you. Rep. Abigail Spanberger: Ditto. Jon Doggett: Thank you. Thank you. Well, thank you so much. This has been, as always, a great conversation and we look forward to doing this some more in the future. And I am looking forward to the day where Capitol Hill is completely opened and we can start dragging our farmers up and down the hallways. And when we do, I would like to have an opportunity for the two of you to sit down with a group of our growers because what you have done today is what you did back in March of 2020, and that is, you've had a conversation that is just so cool to have. And thank you so much, not only for corn growers, but for all of America. So with that, I'm NCGA CEO Jon Doggett, and we hope you'll join us again soon for the next episode of Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast.

    "title": "New Report Details Work of Farmers in Addressing Water Quality Along Mississippi River Basin",
    "content": "A report released this week by the Agricultural Nutrient Policy Council details the work of farmers to improve water quality issues along the Mississippi River Basin. The National Corn Growers Association, a member of ANPC, has played an active role in these efforts. “This report demonstrates the unique approaches ag groups and farmers are employing to protect water quality,” said Iowa farmer and NCGA President Chris Edgington. “Corn growers are committed to being good environmental stewards as we feed and power America.” ANPC was initiated in 2010 to help state and local agricultural trade associations and companies work with farmers to improve water quality issues along the Mississippi River Basin. This latest report stems from interviews with state agricultural trade associations and highlights the work of farmers in 16 states. The report will be presented at the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force on Virtual Meeting on Dec. 14. “We encourage our federal and state agency partners to note agriculture’s deep and enthusiastic commitment to this water quality work and take the opportunity to continue to work collaboratively with agriculture to protect the Gulf and waters across the basin,” Edgington noted.",

    "title": "Farm, Biofuel Groups Ask EPA to Resolve Summertime E15 Barrier",
    "content": "To improve air quality and remove arcane barriers to innovation and consumer choice in the retail fuel marketplace, six national farm and biofuel organizations have asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to enact regulations requiring lower-volatility conventional gasoline blendstock in the summertime. This would result in lower tailpipe and evaporative emissions during the summer ozone control season and improve air quality. In a letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan, the Renewable Fuels Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, Growth Energy, National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, and National Sorghum Producers said reducing the volatility of gasoline by just 1 pound per square inch (psi) would yield significant environmental benefits. Regarding air quality, the six organizations referenced and attached a new study using EPA modeling tools, showing that reducing the vapor pressure of conventional gasoline blendstock by 1 psi “…would be beneficial to air quality, as emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) would be reduced.” The study further concluded that “if the elimination of the 1-psi waiver [for E10] leads to the replacement of E10 with E15, it will also decrease greenhouse gases and particulate emissions.” The organizations also wrote that the move would “simplify engineering of emissions control systems and help facilitate compliance with Renewable Fuel Standard requirements, with no noticeable impact on fuel costs.” They attached a new economic study showing that lowering the volatility of gasoline blendstock would impact the cost of the fuel by just 1-2 pennies per gallon. In addition, the regulatory strategy suggested in the letter would address the Nov. 3 request from seven Midwest governors for EPA’s help to secure state-level regulatory approaches to allow the E15 blend to be made available year-round. “The approach we suggest here would be similar to that contemplated by the Governors, but rather than a state-by-state solution, the proposed regulatory fix would be nationally applicable.”",

    "title": "NCGA Reacts to EPA Proposed Biofuel Blending Volumes",
    "content": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today released delayed proposed biofuel blending volumes under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The agency proposed an increase in the total biofuel blending requirement for 2022 of 22.77 billion gallons, which allows for an implied ethanol volume of 15 billion gallons. EPA also proposed to add 250 million gallons in response to a 2017 court decision, with the remainder of that 500-million-gallon court remand pledged to come in next year’s rulemaking. The proposal includes a total renewable fuel volume of 18.52 for 2021, and a 2.96-billion-gallon reduction from the previous final 2020 volume requirement, the first time EPA has proposed a retroactive RFS volume reduction. In addition, EPA proposed denial of the 65 pending RFS refinery waiver petitions. The U.S. Department of Agriculture separately released COVID assistance funding for biofuel producers that Congress approved last year and committed an additional $100 million to support infrastructure for higher biofuel blends. National Corn Growers Association President Chris Edgington issued the following statement on the proposal: “Because low-carbon ethanol replaces high-carbon gasoline and cuts emissions from vehicles, the proposed volumes for 2022 would help the Biden administration meet emission reduction commitments and lower fuel prices. Denying pending refinery exemption petitions and restoring gallons improperly waived in the past are important steps toward restoring RFS integrity. These actions help move renewable fuels forward. However, reopening 2020 volumes is unprecedented and rewards the use of more oil at the expense of the environment. We strongly urge EPA to move forward with finalizing the strong 2022 volumes while correcting course on the proposed retroactive cuts.”",

As farmers have struggled to secure and pay for fertilizers and other inputs, NCGA has been sounding the alarm saying that tariffs and sanctions on imports only make a bad situation worse. “The American farmer should not have to suffer for the trade practices of foreign governments or for disagreement between multi-national corporations,” Edgington said. “Yet, that is exactly what happens when sanctions or tariffs are put in place.

As a result, the Department of Commerce is recommending countervailing duties on fertilizers from these countries. The decision comes on the heels of a decision by the U.S. International Trade Commission in March to grant a petition by the Mosaic Company to place tariffs on phosphorous fertilizer imported from outside the country. Those tariffs were also recommended by the Commerce Department. In response to this development, the National Corn Growers Association President Chris Edgington released the following statement: “Farmers across the country have spoken publicly over the last several weeks about the severe impact fertilizer shortages are having on the budgets of family farms. While there are a host of issues that contributed to this problem, including restrictive trade policies from other countries and the fallout from Hurricane Ida, the Mosaic tariffs have only made a bad situation worse. Given the crippling effect these tariffs have had on farmers, it’s deeply disappointing to see that the U.S. Commerce Department and CF Industries would continue to press for more tariffs. Farmers shouldn’t have to pay for disputes between American fertilizer companies and foreign producers. Mosaic and CF Industries can easily resolve these issues and provide immediate relief to farmers by dropping their petitions.”",

    "content": "The U.S. Court of International Trade this week said that it will review an amicus brief submitted by the National Corn Growers Association and other ag groups in a case it’s considering on tariffs of phosphorous fertilizers imported from outside the country. But farmers, faced with severe shortages and high fertilizer costs, are calling on a major American fertilizer company to withdraw the petition that led to the tariffs. “Executives at Mosaic can remove this financial burden by withdrawing the petition,” Edgington said. “We invite them to do just that.” The U.S. Department of Commerce recommended in February 2021 that the International Trade Commission implement tariffs over 19% on imported fertilizers from Morocco after the Mosaic Company, which manufactures fertilizers used in the U.S. and abroad, filed a petition with the department seeking the levies. The ITC voted in March to impose the tariffs while adding similar levies on Russian imports. CF Industries also filed a petition with ITC to place tariffs on urea ammonium nitrate solutions, which are used in liquid fertilizers, imported from Russia and Trinidad & Tobago. A decision on that request is pending. “Given the effects tariffs are having on farmers, we hope the executives at CF Industries will withdraw their petition,” Edgington said. The financial impact of tariffs are beginning to dim planting forecasts for 2022, according to economists. Fertilizer costs between 2021 and 2022 are projected to lower net incomes by 34% in Illinois, according to new projections from economists at the University of Illinois. Farmers say the forecast in Illinois is illustrative of what’s happening across the country. “The tariffs have created a financial hardship for farmers.” Edgington said. “Another year of shortages and tariffs will be devastating.” The court could render a decision in 2022.",

    "title": "House Passes $1.7 Trillion Build Back Better Legislation, Allocating $82 Billion in Funding For Agriculture to Address Climate Change",
    "content": "Bill Steers Clear of Harmful Tax Changes for Farmers The House of Representatives voted today on a party-line basis to approve the $1.7 trillion budget reconciliation and spending bill, H.R. 5376, referred to as the Build Back Better Act. NCGA worked with allies of farmers and rural communities in Congress to ensure that the bill did not remove important tax provisions that would directly affect family farms. “Our number one concern has been proposals to remove stepped-up basis,” said Iowa farmer and NCGA President Chris Edgington. “That will continue to be our focus as the legislation moves to the Senate.” The House version of the bill makes no changes to stepped-up basis, the current tax provision important to corn growers. Stepped-up basis and the estate tax provisions in the current tax code help protect family farms that are transferred from generation to generation. In an acknowledgment of the role farmers can play in addressing environmental issues, leaders on the House and Senate Agriculture Committees worked together to allocate the following funding: $9 billion for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program to specifically increase funding for practices that help producers implement and expand conservation practices on their operations. $7.5 billion for the Regional Conservation Partnerships Program. $4 billion for the Conservation Security Program, which focuses on whole-farm conservation systems. $1.5 billion for the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program to ensure that land in easements is used in a way that protects soil and water while maintaining its viability as farmland. $5 billion for a new cover crop initiative at FSA that provides farmers an alternative to get started with this critical conservation practice. $1 billion for USDA to provide technical assistance to farmers on climate issues. $960 billion for USDA to provide cost-share assistance for infrastructure to deploy higher blends of ethanol in the marketplace. The legislation also includes a new clean fuel production tax credit that would become effective in 2027 and apply to low-carbon ethanol. “We are appreciative of the members of Congress, particularly those on the Agriculture Committees, who recognize the role agriculture can play in addressing climate change,” Edgington said. The bill is expected to be taken up in the Senate following the Thanksgiving holiday.",

    "title": "Op-Ed: American Farmers Face Crippling Prices at the Hands of Fertilizer Oligopoly",
    "content": "Op-Ed published Nov. 16, 2021 | Farm Journal AgWeb The following op-ed was written by Jon Doggett, CEO of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA). If you’re looking to make a killing off the stock market, forget about Amazon, you should invest in fertilizer companies. While other corporations and firms are attracting public scrutiny for how their practices impact Americans, fertilizer executives are making out like bandits at the expense of the people who feed and fuel America. Let’s just refer to them as the Fertilizer Oligopoly. What has the Fertilizer Oligopoly been up to? It is using the government to elbow the competition out of the way and taking over the American fertilizer market. One of the most Machiavellian moves by the Fertilizer Oligopoly came when the U.S.-based company Mosaic, which produces fertilizers sold here and abroad, used severe weather conditions in 2017 and 2018, which reduced fertilizer purchases, to manufacture a crisis that it convinced the International Trade Commission was the fault of imports. ITC fell for this nonsense hook, line and sinker, and in March it imposed 19.7% tariffs on phosphate fertilizers imported from Morocco and Russia. It goes without saying that this development has caused a real crisis in the farming community, where corn growers and other farmers are telling me that fertilizer prices have gone up as much as 200% in one year. As prices increase for these products, farmers are also dealing with supply issues that are hiking costs for seed and crop protection products. This is all a gut punch to the American farmer. Meanwhile, the Fertilizer Oligopoly is profiteering. Mosaic’s August phosphate fertilizer sector earnings were up $200 million over its 2020 profits, and the company is gaining a near-monopoly over the phosphate fertilizer supply in the U.S. In fact, Mosaic’s phosphate market has grown from 74% to over 80% as tariffs have been placed on imports. The tariffs along with other factors, such as natural gas prices, are raising the cost of fertilizers to historic highs. But the plot thickens. Right when it looked like Mosaic was the biggest and best in the world of Fertilizer Oligopolies, CF Industries, took a page out of Mosaic’s playbook and filed a petition with ITC to place tariffs on urea ammonium nitrate solutions, which are used in liquid fertilizers, imported from Russia and Trinidad & Tobago. While CF Industries’ complaint remains under consideration at ITC, the company has closed some of it plants in England, which further impacts fertilizer supply and drives up prices for American farmers. While severe fertilizer shortages are being felt across the country, farmers need not look to the Fertilizer Oligopoly for help, as Mosaic no longer sees the U.S. market as its only priority. After all, it recently increased exports to Canada and has started exporting fertilizers to Brazil. Farmers out in the American heartland, stuck with exorbitantly high prices for fertilizers, are furious that corporations have been able to use a government entity to consolidate a market and hike prices on inputs. As one farmer put it, “I struggle to understand why a company that has 73% to 74% of the market share needs the International Trade Commission to impose tariffs to help them get to 80%-plus.” Our organization recently joined several other groups in issuing an amicus brief in a case brought to the U.S. Court of International Trade by a fertilizer company from Morocco. But the court won’t rule on the case until 2022, which means farmers will have to go through at least another season paying inflated prices for fertilizers. We hope the court will reverse the decision on phosphate tariffs. We also hope the executives at CF Industries will realize the effect tariffs are having on American farmers and withdraw their petition to impose more tariffs. Most importantly, we want Americans and policymakers to understand that corporations are profiting at the expense of family farmers. We also encourage fertilizer companies will remember who their customers are. Rather than spreading inaccurate information about the threat of imports, they should be helping farmers spread affordable fertilizer.",

    "content": "Since 1957, NCGA has stayed true to its mission of creating and increasing opportunities for corn growers throughout the United States. As part of this mission, our efforts across the sustainability sector have made waves for the advancement of land, water, and energy uses. Taking our commitment to environmental sustainability one step further, NCGA has recently partnered with Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever – the nation’s leading charities for upland wildlife habitat conservation – to provide our members with direct complimentary conservation planning services for pollinator habitat outcomes in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Pollinator health is one of the leading sustainability issues in twenty-first-century agriculture. As public interest in pollinator health continues to increase, stakeholders in this discussion – our members and producers nationwide – have a critical role to play for implementation. By partnering with Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever, NCGA can assist growers with profitability and sustainability measures on their farms for win-win scenarios. “Pollinator habitats are vitally important, even though we don't think about it in corn production, that need for pollinators, but we begin to see that it’s not just the pollinators, but the beneficial insects that also come in that can help alleviate some of the need for certain pesticides,” said Nebraska corn grower and NCGA Corn Board member Brandon Hunnicutt. “When we introduce those habitats, we introduce a whole new set of insects around it, and it becomes very important as we're looking at how we can reduce some of our environmental footprint, which includes being really aware of what we're using for crop protection products.” Want to learn how to build your own field of pollinator dreams?

    "content": "NCGA said today that the EPA did not use the best available science and data in the recently released endangered species biological evaluations for glyphosate, atrazine, and simazine, and, as a result, EPA’s final assessment for these chemistries vastly inflate the number of species and habitats found likely to be adversely affected. “The assumptions EPA made in drafting this biological evaluation are not based on the real-world use of these products,” said Iowa farmer and NCGA President Chris Edgington. “It vastly overestimated the volume of herbicide farmers use and instead relied on inflated levels that resulted in this evaluation.” In its evaluation, which was released on Friday and conducted as part of the Endangered Species Act, EPA looked at the effects of glyphosate, atrazine and simazine on endangered species when used at the highest legal limits rather than at levels typically used by farmers. EPA’s determination is also based on the assumption that the chemistries are used more frequently than estimates would suggest. “EPA previously promised grower groups, including the National Corn Growers Association, that the agency would only use the best available science in its studies,” Edgington said. “In this case, EPA has not kept its promise.” EPA’s unrealistic work product will now be used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to determine whether the herbicides harm endangered species and could result in product restrictions.",

Need any ideas for how you can inspire young minds for agricultural science? We’ve got you covered! Find activities and lessons on biotechnology, biofuels, water quality, soil and sustainability by visiting the Nourish the Future's (NTF) curriculum page. 4-H’s STEM and Agriculture programs cover topics not limited to Engineering & Technology; Environmental Science & Alternative energy; and Plant & Animal Science. For younger readers, check out Kansas Corn STEM’s book, “We Grow Corn.” There are additional activities, videos and resources to help with corn-centric hands-on learning. Texas Corn Producers also have a collection of Educational Resources to keep K-5 students engaged and learning about the world of agriculture. For older students, broaden their horizons in career pathways with a tour of FFA’s Ag Explorer. And for science teachers looking to take their STEM knowledge and skills to the next level, consider applying for NTF’s Teacher Learner Community III. NCGA believes agriculture is a vital partner in engaging students in STEM concepts in ways that directly and indirectly impact their lives and the lives of farmers. Not only does teaching an ag-based curriculum in the science classroom inspire students to solve real-world science issues, reaching students is critical to address the job gap in agriculture-related careers, many of which go unfilled. Nourish the Future—an initiative of NCGA’s Sustainable Ag Research Action Team—is sponsored directly with the investment of state corn checkoff dollars.",

    "content": "The House of Representatives voted 228 to 206 Friday night to approve the bipartisan infrastructure package, which the Senate passed in August by a vote of 69 to 30, clearing the way for legislation to become law. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes funding important to corn growers, including $17.3 billion for the nation’s ports and inland waterways and $2 billion specifically for rural broadband access. New spending in the bill is paid for through unused Covid relief funds, bonds and extensions of various government fees, and the bill does not include tax increases for individuals or farms. “We are pleased to see the House act on this legislation which was developed in a bipartisan manner and allocates funding for initiatives that are extremely important to corn growers and rural America,” said NCGA President Chris Edgington. “This is a once in a generation infrastructure investment that will help farmers for years to come.” As 60% of corn exports move on the inland waterways system, the maintenance of that system is vital for the global competitiveness of U.S. farmers. The funds dedicated to providing broadband access specifically for rural areas will be meaningful for corn growers who rely on this access for marketing crops, using precision technologies and running their business. The bipartisan infrastructure plan, which has already passed the Senate, will head to the president to be signed into law.",

    "content": "On the sidelines of the Group of 20 Summit this past weekend, European Union officials and the Biden administration brokered a deal that will ease tariffs on E.U. steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. while eliminating retaliatory duties from the E.U. on several U.S. goods, including U.S. Corn. “This is an important step for America’s corn farmers and a step toward restoring our trading relationship with the European Union,” said NCGA President Chris Edgington. “We were dragged into a trade dispute that did not involve us, and we are highly appreciative of the Biden administration for this development.” In May of this year, the Biden administration announced the start of discussions with the E.U. to address global steel and aluminum excess capacity, which originally prompted the U.S. to apply tariffs on European steel and aluminum imports under the authority of Section 232. This action was met by the E.U. imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, including a 25% tariff on U.S. corn. Under the new deal, the U.S. agreed to provide a duty-free quota for European steel and aluminum while keeping the Section 232 tariffs in place for any steel or aluminum shipped in excess of the quota, maintaining a minimum level of protection for American-made steel and aluminum. “As farmers, we feed and fuel the world,” said Edgington. “When our crops are used as a bargaining chip, everyone loses.” More details on the agreement can be found on USTR’s factsheet here.",

    "title": "U.S. Farmers Report Concerns of Shortages, Crippling Prices Due to Tariffs on Fertilizers, NCGA and Other Ag Groups Tell U.S. Court of International Trade",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association joined four other agricultural groups on Friday in encouraging the U.S. Court of International Trade to overturn an earlier decision by the International Trade Commission, which imposed tariffs on imported phosphate fertilizers from Morocco. “Farmers are feeling the pain from these tariffs,” said Iowa farmer and NCGA President Chris Edgington. “We’re facing severe cost hikes on our fertilizers, and we are worried about fertilizer shortages next year. We desperately need the U.S. Court of International Trade to remedy this situation.” The U.S. Department of Commerce recommended in February 2021 that the ITC implement tariffs over 19% on imported fertilizers from Morocco after the Mosaic Company, which manufactures fertilizers used in the U.S. and abroad, filed a petition with the department seeking the levies. The ITC voted in March to impose the tariffs while adding similar levies on Russian imports. As a result, critical sources of imported supply have been shut out of the U.S. market, and the costs for fertilizers have increased for farmers. In the meantime, Mosaic, whose control of the phosphate market has grown from 74% to over 80%, is gaining a near-monopoly over the phosphate fertilizer supply in the U.S. In fact, Mosaic’s share price has quadrupled since a March 2020 low. “Farmers pay the price when input companies monopolize a market,” said Edgington. To get our job done and keep prices reasonable, we need quick access to fertilizers from multiple companies, including those outside the U.S.” One of the arguments in the brief centers on a decision by Mosaic in 2017 to shutter two facilities, which caused a shortage of fertilizers for U.S. farmers in the 2018 planting season. As a result, farmers sought supplies from companies outside the U.S. Fertilizer supply typically takes several months to work its way through the supply chain, the brief notes. In addition, unexpected weather patterns, such as abnormally high precipitation, can negatively impact demand for fertilizers, causing a mismatch between projected demand and actual purchases. “…farmers can only apply fertilizers during a finite window of the planting season,” the brief explains. If supply is not available during that window, fertilizer application must be delayed until some future window of opportunity. This places a premium on reliability of supply, leading suppliers to diversify sourcing.” Agricultural Retailers Association, American Soybean Association, the National Cotton Council and the National Sorghum Producers also signed the brief. The Iowa Corn Growers also weighed in with the ITC and Department of Commerce on this issue in late summer. A decision from the court could come in 2022.",

    "content": "Today, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) announced the Consider Corn Challenge III winners at the Advanced Biofuels Leadership Conference in San Francisco, California. The six winners were chosen because their technologies can improve a product or process, scale-up and produce biobased materials from field corn. “We know we produce an affordable, abundant and sustainable crop that can be used for a variety of uses and applications, which is why we held the contest,” said NCGA Market Development Action Team (MDAT) Chair and Iowa farmer Bob Hemesath. “The value of corn as an industrial feedstock continues to improve thanks to advancements in technology, production and logistics efficiency. Corn is the perfect solution for biobased products, especially as society becomes increasingly interested in more sustainable products.” The six winners of the Consider Corn Challenge III are the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, BioAstra Technologies from Quebec, Canada, Catalyxx of Chesterfield, Missouri, Danimer Scientific based in Bainbridge, Georgia, Låkril Technologies out of the University of Minnesota, and Sylvatex from San Francisco, California. Previous winners of the Consider Corn Challenge contests have scaled up to the next phase of development, received additional grant funding, entered into joint agreements and obtained registration for state biobased production incentives. If all 15 winners of the Consider Corn Challenge I, II & III reached full commercialization with products available in the marketplace, the potential for additional corn demand could be approximately 3.4 billion bushels. “This contest allows us to be more innovative in meeting the needs of our customers, who want more sustainable, biobased products,” Hemesath added. “Farmers have made great strides over the years to utilize the technology that allows them to grow more on less land using fewer resources per bushel. There is enough corn grown to be able to meet the needs for food, feed, fuel and new uses.” The total prize pool was U.S. $150,000, split equally between winners. More about the winners’ submissions: National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL): What: Acrylonitrile to Carbon Fiber Uses: Lightweight replacement for steel and aluminum in products like vehicles BioAstra Technologies: What: Smart and recyclable formulations based on cellulose and PLA. Uses: Plastic bags, surgical masks, and Phase-Change Materials. Catalyxx: What: Bio n-butanol and other longer chain linear alcohols from ethanol Uses: n-Butanol is used to make other chemicals (butyl acetate and butyl acrylates), valuable as a solvent or as an ingredient in formulated products such as cosmetics. The C4+ alcohol mix can be used for diesel and marine fuels. Danimer Scientific: What: PHA from corn oil Uses: Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable, biobased polymers that can be used for plastics Låkril Technologies: What: Bio-acrylic acid made from lactic acid Uses: Bio-acrylic acid can be used for bio-polyacrylic acid (PAA) as super absorbers in hygiene products & diapers and for bio-acrylate polymers in paints and industrial coatings systems. Sylvatex (SVX): What: Sustainable solutions made from biomass-derived oxygenates and free fatty acids useful as alternative diesel fuel or specialty chemicals for the production of cathodes used in lithium-ion batteries.

    "content": "It may not be January 1, but there’s a new president at NCGA, and we’re getting to know him better. With harvest season winding down, NCGA members are observing another fall milestone—the induction of a new NCGA president, Chris Edgington. Administratively speaking, NCGA’s “new year” began on October 1. And, hailing from St. Ansgar, Iowa, Chris has been sworn in to lead the organization in the year ahead. So in this episode, we’re going to get to know him a little bit better… his operation, what drives him to lead, and what he sees as the biggest hurdles that growers face in the year ahead. Direct Share Link Transcript Chris Edgington: Those of us in agriculture, we need a team. We need people that are working on this daily because we can produce a lot of products in the U.S. that we cannot consume here. So we need a team promoting them. Dusty Weis: Hello and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host, Association CEO, John Doggett. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway, we're making sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: With harvest season winding down, NCGA members are observing another fall milestone, the induction of a new NCGA president, Iowa grower Chris Edgington. He's been sworn in to lead the organization in the year ahead. And so in this episode, we're going to get to know him a little bit better, his operation, what drives him to lead, and what he sees as the biggest hurdles that growers face in the year ahead. But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also, make sure you follow the NCGA on Twitter @NationalCorn and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. Dusty Weis: And with that, it's time to once again introduce Jon, Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. And Jon, might still be early in the fall, but understand that we're celebrating new year's already on today's episode. Jon Doggett: Well, it isn't Chinese New Year's, it's NCGA new year's. And we begin our new year at NCGA October 1st, so already for us it's 2022. And what some folks say, that's how we stay ahead of things in this organization. So with the new year comes a new president. And October 1, 2021, Chris Edgington of St. Ansgar, Iowa became our new president, and he's going to lead us over the next 12 months. So Chris, happy new year, congratulations on your new job, and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam. Chris Edgington: Thank you. Glad to be here. Jon Doggett: Chris, tell us about your family. Tell us about your farm. Tell us about where is St. Ansgar, Iowa. Chris Edgington: Well, let's start with that. First, it's far North Central, Iowa, about halfway between Des Moines and Minneapolis, not all too far from Interstate 35 or Interstate 90. So it's actually fairly easy to find. And we're part of a multi-generation farm that will probably be rolling in here and hopefully not disrupting this. But I still farm, fortunate to farm with my dad, my brother, a son, some nieces. We have a lot of family members. It is definitely a family-driven business and sometimes that brings some interesting dynamics and discussions as we work on our game plans. But definitely a family farm and really enjoy being part of it. Jon Doggett: So Chris, we're recording this on the 21st of October. Where are you with harvest as of today? Chris Edgington: We're about two-thirds done with corn. Actually, it's been really dry for us. We get some drizzle events, a little bit of what's going on right now this morning here, but we have not had any big rains this fall. It was kind of the pattern for the summer where we missed a lot of stuff. But you don't have to go too far away to the east and they're using chains and cables to pull people out as they're getting stuck in the field. So I'm unfortunate that we're able to keep going and we are past the halfway point. And soybeans are not quite wrapped up. We've still got one field to finish, but that one needs a little bit more time. Jon Doggett: So Chris, I'm going to ask you a question, and I think throughout the year you may ask yourself this question and others may ask you this question in various ways, but why did you want this job? Chris Edgington: Well, I guess it depends on a), do you look at the year I'm going to do as a job or as an opportunity. And I've been involved in commodity organizations or value-added opportunities and other businesses throughout my career trying to help build small-town America, trying to be part of revitalizing rural economies and family farms, family operations, small-town businesses. And so this has kind of just been a natural progression for me to continue to raise my hand. As a good friend of mine has said, you raise your hand until it hurts and then raise it a little bit more. And I've kind of continued to do that along with having the full support of the family as they also are engaged in other opportunities to help with their small-town areas. So it's not so much I would say it's a job, it's an opportunity to continue to build on what I've been doing and provide value back to small-town America. Dusty Weis: You know, Chris, one of the most fascinating things for me as I've gotten to know the Corn Growers better as an organization in the course of doing this podcast, just meeting all the different growers from all around the country and hearing how they've all got different stories to tell in some ways and a lot of other ways they've got stories that are very, very similar. And so as you've gotten engaged with the Corn Growers and begun to build these relationships with farmers from across the country, what's the thing that sticks out the most at you about the stories that you're hearing the people tell about what's going on in their fields? Chris Edgington: Yeah. They're very similar. It doesn't matter if you farm in Texas or North Dakota or California or Maryland, the farming challenges are similar. We're all worried about production. We're all worried about price. We're all worried about input. But that's not just in the U.S. I've been fortunate to travel a little bit internationally, and if you sit down with a group of farmers in Vietnam or China or South America, the discussion's the same. It's about how do you produce more more efficiently with less input and less cost so that you can try to maintain some level of profitability. Chris Edgington: And as people say, farmers are the only group that when they get done at the end of the day and they go uptown, they still talk about farming. Sometimes that's really good. And sometimes we need to remember that we've got families and other things. It should take some priority and some focus. But the thing you see, it's very similar across not only the U.S. but across the world when it comes to the feeling of producing food and a crop to help sustain the world is a deep-rooted family feeling. Jon Doggett: So Chris, who were some of the mentors that guided you through all of this journey that you've been on for these many years? Chris Edgington: Well, first you start with family. You know, you start with mom and dad and what are they doing and how does that affect your influence. You know, I went to college and graduated from Iowa State and lived with a bunch of guys down there that were also involved in agriculture and how did they view things from their viewpoint. And some of them have gone on and done some very interesting things with their careers outside of production agriculture, but still tied to agriculture. And so you get some influences there. It broadens your scope of what you see locally. I've been fortunate to be involved with some very solid extension agents and their viewpoints from Iowa State on how they look at either production or marketing and the business savvy and what goes into all of that. Chris Edgington: And then it's just the people. It's just meeting people. And I've got some friends in the corn organization that some of them are now out of the organization, but we're very, very successful in it. And they did a lot of really positive things. They gave me a lot of encouragement, a lot of advice on how you approach these activities in a day-to-day basis. And obviously, I was fortunate, my wife has been a tremendous influence. Her family has also been real interesting and positive in a lot of the ways because they have a farm background, but her parents did not farm. They were in business, totally different business than agriculture. And so it brought in some perspectives that she and I or her dad and I would talk about some of these things. It gives you a different perspective. Chris Edgington: So there's a lot of different people, Jon. And to say that there's just one is a challenge. I think there's a whole lot of people that help shape you as long as you're willing to listen and willing to be engaged. Dusty Weis: You know, Chris, you talk about all the people that you've gotten to know along the way. And it's interesting to me because you've come through this organization and probably worked your way up through some of the committees to assume the presidency here, but where did you start with the Corn Growers, and how did you get to the point where now you're leading it? Chris Edgington: You know, it's interesting because I was doing value-added businesses. I was involved with Ag Ventures Alliance out of Mason City, Iowa and then got involved in a project called Rural Development Partners. And I was sitting on a board called Golden Oval Eggs. It was a farmer-owned co-op. I was at a wedding actually of a niece of mine and a friend said that I just went through Iowa Corn's I-LEAD class and I think you would really enjoy it. And timing was not good. I was too busy with other things. And I happened to, as we were selling the Golden Oval Eggs Project to a different firm, I happen to see an ad in the Des Moines Register that talked about I-LEAD with Iowa Corn. Chris Edgington: And I'd been involved a little bit with our local county, very little because I was involved in some of these other projects. And I applied to be on I-LEAD in 2008, 2009, was accepted into the class. As I got towards the end of the class, I needed to make a decision. Pam Johnson, a past national president, friend of mine that lives not too far away, was terming off the Iowa board. They needed somebody from our district to be willing to run. And so I said I would. That was in 2010. And here we are today. I served nine years in Iowa and through the various officer positions there and then got elected to this board in 2016 and had been involved in a bunch of action teams up to that. Chris Edgington: So for a lot of people, I'm actually kind of a latecomer. And actually, John Linder was kind of the same, the previous president. Both of us started about the same time in our states. But there's people that have been involved in their state organizations for 20, 30 years. And some of them actually been on national boards and gone back to their state board. And so it depends on the state that they live in. Some have term limits, some don't. But I'm kind of a latecomer to corn in some ways. But I've been really enjoying what I've been doing here. Dusty Weis: You know, Chris, you describe yourself as a latecomer and certainly to become the president, even as someone who's only been involved with the Corn Growers for a little more than a decade, you must be making an impact there. So Jon Doggett, as CEO of the organization, what's your first memory of meeting Chris Edgington? What kind of an impact did he make the first time you met him? Jon Doggett: I remember meeting Chris, it was during an action team meeting somewhere out in the hallway. Just met him, shook his hand. And I asked Craig Floss, the exec at Iowa Corn later in the day, I said, \"Who's this Edgington guy?\" He said, \"Ah, he's from North Central. Iowa, is a pretty good guy. He's a little intense sometimes. But you know what? I think he's going to be good.\" Chris Edgington: I'm not sure he exactly said it that way, but that's nice of you, Jon, to put it into that format. Jon Doggett: I'm merely paraphrasing. Chris Edgington: Yeah. And I'd like to say that I can be intensely focused on the issue at hand sometimes to the point that it's probably not to my benefit. Jon Doggett: So Chris, what drives you to do what you do? I mean, you've been so active and so involved. What's the drive? Chris Edgington: You know, a lot of it's I think what drives most family operations, most family businesses, trying to make the business better for the next generation. And when you say that people say, well, you don't think your folks did a very good job or your grandparents? Well, they had different situations. They had different technology. And so we're all trying to grow the technology, use the information we gain to make things better. And some of that's local, some of that's on the farm, but some of it's not. And some of it you need to go to Washington or Des Moines or Argentina or China or some other place and discuss what we're doing and how it really works on the farm in Iowa and Minnesota and Texas and across the country. Chris Edgington: And so I guess I'm not afraid to be one of the people that's up front, maybe asking some other people questions about trying to educate, help educate about why what we're doing is very efficient and they should be proud of what we're doing because we are. Jon Doggett: So Chris, when you were making the decision whether to run to be an officer in this organization and you took that to your family, what was the question that they asked you that gave you a moment of pause? Chris Edgington: So the biggest question is not about the value that I'm doing, but are you going to be here in the spring and the fall? Because that's the heavy workloads times. And everybody, typical family operation you wear many hats and you don't have a lot of extra people standing around. And so are you going to be able to be here most of the time in the spring and the fall? The rest of the year, if you're gone, that's part of it. And they understand it and they see the value in it because they've all been doing it. Chris Edgington: But when you step into this current role, spring and fall can be a little bit of a challenge. But we're working through it. This year, it's been going good. And next week will be my first travel. And it'll be relatively short for that one. And by the time I hit the road again, I think we should have things pretty well wrapped up. Jon Doggett: Excellent timing. Chris Edgington: Excellent. Jon Doggett: So Chris, you and I have talked a lot and I know you have talked to a lot of people about this, but teamwork really matters to you. Why is that? Chris Edgington: Because we can only do so much by ourselves. There are a couple activities that you can do and be really good at by yourself, one of them being golf. But even golf takes a team if you ask the pros. They've got a team behind them working on helping them get better so that they can make that living. But those of us in agriculture, we need a team. We need people that are working on this daily from a staff standpoint both local and in DC and around the world with the Grains Council and USMEF because we can produce a lot of products in the U.S. that we cannot consume here. So we need a team promoting them. We need a team working on our issues. Chris Edgington: I have learned a lot in my time here with corn about the political aspect of how things move and what's really important. And I would guess if you asked most farmers, they would think that the Ag Committee is probably the most powerful committee in Washington, DC. But what you find out when you've done this is that they're actually, they're not. They're really powerful about once every four years, and then the other three years there's other committees that take precedent. And so it takes a team. It takes a group of people dedicated to making sure that production agriculture continues to be gaining on the positives that we've had over the last 50 years. Jon Doggett: Chris, as you're looking at the broad landscape of this organization and this industry, what's the biggest opportunity corn farmers have right now? Chris Edgington: That we're able to produce a great crop with limited resources in some cases is an opportunity. International markets are an opportunity. Technology is an opportunity. And they'll all be utilized. They'll all come into place. At the same time, those all provide challenges. We've got input supply challenges at the moment. Prices are going through the roof because they can't get the supply. Everybody out there has seen what's happened to gasoline. Well, that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to a producer and he's looking at it production. Chris Edgington: International markets, we've seen them come and go. And sometimes they've come and go not because of the buyer but because of the people sitting in charge of those countries or in charge of our country. Tariffs and embargoes and things like that that have happened over the last 50 years very seldom give us a lot of help, and yet they can be an opportunity because we do play in a world scale. And so if we lose a market one place, we're scrambling to find a market in a new place. And maybe when the other market comes back, we've still got the new market, so maybe we grew our market. Chris Edgington: So it's interwoven, Jon, when it comes to both opportunities and challenges as to both of them have got two different sides of the story. But what farmers really want is they want some certainty. They want to know that their inputs will be there reliably on time with the amount that they need. They also want to know that they've got certain markets that are going to be there every day. Livestock is always of great consumer products here in the U.S. So is the ethanol industry. And so are some of our other industrial uses. Exports, we've got some countries that are fantastic every single year. And then we got some countries that are challenges. Chris Edgington: But certainty is something that farmers would really like because it's tough to manage a business where mother nature is your best partner and you have no control over mother nature, and so you're trying to manage everything else. Jon Doggett: So Chris, I'm going to ask you two questions. The first question is if you had one minute and only one minute, that's 60 seconds with the President of the United States, what would you tell him? Chris Edgington: I think I'd go back to where I just finished. I'd say farmers need certainty. We need certainty in government regulations. We need certainty in export markets. We need certainty in supply. Do not step and do things that cause all kinds of confusion and lack of certainty. We need certainty and regulations coming out of your organizations, whether it's USDA or EPA or DOE or whoever else we touch, and we trust that you're going to bring us that certainty because that is part of your responsibility. Jon Doggett: Okay. And the second question, similar to the first, and that is you talked about next week you're going to be on a plane again. And as president of this organization, you're going to be on a lot of planes. So let's say you sit down in your seat on the plane and you're sitting next to a young Millennial from one of the coasts. Obviously, never had anything to do with agriculture in the sense that we describe it. But you have one minute to tell that young Millennial with all the tattoos and the piercings and the, probably has hair, what would you say to that person to connect them a little bit better to what it is that you do? Chris Edgington: I think I'd talk about our trust in our sustainability and that we drink water, we breathe air just same as they do. We consume food every day on a daily basis. And we want a high-quality, consistent product as well, both whether it's drinking or eating. And so maybe a little trust on our sustainability efforts and that we do know that we are improving water quality, we are improving soil health, and that will allow them to feel very comfortable when they go to the grocery store and buy whatever product that they're going to buy and consume that day or the next day. Jon Doggett: So Chris, what's something people might misunderstand about you? Chris Edgington: Well, I think we actually touched on it earlier probably. And that's the intensity of the look, the intensity of my thought or my question. And I've said this, because I do ask a lot of questions, I'm not asking questions oftentimes to second guess. I'm asking questions to provide clarity to me and to anybody else that might be in the room. And so when people understand that I'm just looking for more clarity, that helps when it comes to some of the probing questions that I might do. Jon Doggett: You're in your first month and this time will go very, very quickly between now and the end of September of next year. What are you hoping to get done in this next year? Chris Edgington: You know, Jon, that's kind of a loaded question. I guess my philosophy is, it's always been, as I've stepped to the front of a room in some other organizations, is at the end of the year I hope that the organization, the people, the industry are a little bit better overall than when I came in. I can't do a lot by myself. That was the whole point about teamwork. It's no different than the star pitcher who can strike out the side, but the offense never scores either. No different than a quarterback who can throw it 70 yards in the air flat-footed, but the offensive line never gives him a chance to even find his feet to be flat-footed. It's all about teamwork, and so if the team is working a little better, if the industry is a little better at the end of the year, I'm going to say it is success from my point. Jon Doggett: So Chris, thank you so much for all that you do. And I know that you're sitting in your office and you're getting ready for a big day with harvest. You have a lot of things to manage. So thank you so much for your time and thank you for your commitment to this organization and to this industry. Chris Edgington: You know, it's been a great morning doing this, but it's very easy to be committed to an industry when you enjoy producing that crop and then being part of that industry from the get-go. So it's pretty easy to be committed. Jon Doggett: That's great. Well with that, this is another episode of Wherever Jon May Roam.

    "title": "Winning Innovators Announced in the Next Gen Fertilizer Challenges",
    "content": "Last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced the winners of the Next Generation Fertilizer Innovations Challenge. Along with EPA and USDA, the competition is a collaboration with The Fertilizer Institute (TFI), the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA). “This collaboration allows us to propel advancement with unified efforts from the private and public sectors. Corn farmers are committed to continuous improvements in sustainability and efficiency—we are always looking for new ways to be better,” said Iowa corn grower and NCGA President Chris Edgington. “This competition is an opportunity to encourage the development of new technologies and innovative practices which will help bolster productivity and profitability for growers.” The goal of the competition is to improve the efficiency of fertilizers to increase crop yields while reducing the impacts of fertilizers on the environment. Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers facilitate the growth of crops, including corn, at yields that provide sustained global food production. “Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizer” (EEF) is a term for new formulations that control fertilizer release or alter reactions that reduce nutrient losses to the environment. EEFs and other next-generation product technology innovations may be an important addition to a system of conservation practices that help reduce the impacts from row crop agriculture on the environment while maintaining or increasing agricultural productivity and profitability. The winning concepts from this leg of the challenge include a range of solutions that can improve environmental outcomes, including reduced nitrous oxide emissions—the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture—while maintaining or increasing crop yields. “Nutrient stewardship has been a strong factor in our progress and will continue to be an integral consideration in order to meet or exceed our U.S. Corn Sustainability Goals,” said Edgington. “Farmers will continue to monitor and optimize the 4R’s—the right source, right rate, right time and right place. Pairing these best management practices along with new solutions, we will maximize progress towards our goal of reducing GHG emissions an additional 13% by 2030.” To view the full list of winners and their innovative concepts: https://www.epa.gov/innovation/next-gen-fertilizer-innovations-challenge-winners.

    "title": "NCGA, Other Ag Groups, Comment on Disruptive Factors Facing U.S. Supply Chain",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association joined 51 other agricultural groups in submitting comments this week to the U.S. Department of Transportation addressing the many disruptive factors facing the U.S. supply chain. The comments provide recommendations on how to alleviate these challenges through legislative and regulatory actions. “To be successful, farmers must have a reliable and fully functioning national transportation system that will allow us to receive our fall fertilizer shipments and deliver our products to consumers in a timely fashion,” said NCGA President Chris Edgington. “That’s why NCGA, along with other groups, are making our voices heard in these discussions.” The comments address several key areas of concern to corn growers, including: Inland Waterways. The inland waterways system is vital to the American supply chain and gives U.S. producers a significant advantage in terms of cost and efficiency over international competitors. The comments urge the administration to prioritize legislative and regulatory actions that promote the rehabilitation of aging waterway infrastructure on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois River. This includes the addition of seven 1,200-foot locks on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway as part of the Navigation Ecosystem Sustainability Program. Rail Competition and Service. The comments mention the value of promoting competition in rail transportation and the cost saving outcomes such actions would have on U.S. grain shippers and receivers. The comments encourage the Surface Transportation Board to consider a regulation which would allow for the use of “reciprocal” or “competitive switching.” Competitive switching would enable shippers and receivers geographically beholden to one rail carrier to gain access to a second rail carrier through a short distance “switch.” NCGA supports a competitive and nondiscriminatory rate structure for our nation’s railroads. Motor Carrier Freight Transportation Efficiency. The comments recommend a few key actions that could help alleviate the disruption in the U.S. motor carrier freight transportation sector. One of our recommendations, for example, was that USDA and the U.S. Department of Transportation continue to coordinate to ensure agricultural haulers and the rest of the trucking industry have the flexibilities needed to provide timely delivery of essential products. Flexibilities such as relief from Hours-of-Service requirements have been critical over the last 18 months. NCGA’s actions come on the heels of President Biden’s announcement that the Port of Los Angeles would begin to operate 24 hours, seven days a week. This move could potentially mitigate the bottleneck of goods on the west coast awaiting distribution throughout the country.",

    "title": "National Corn Growers Association forges new partnership with Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is proud to announce their partnership—funded by NCGA’s Production Technology Access Action Team (PTAAT)—with Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever. This new collaboration will focus on increasing pollinator and wildlife habitat in corn-producing states. Initially, the partnership will focus on corn producers in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, with room for expansion down the road. “Pollinator health is a leading sustainability issue in 21st-century agriculture,” said Ohio grower and PTAAT Vice Chair Patty Mann. “As public interest in pollinator health continues to increase, stakeholders in this discussion – our members and producers nationwide – have a critical role to play for implementation. By partnering with Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever, NCGA can assist growers with profitability and sustainability measures on their farms for win-win scenarios.” Pollinators are essential to the health of upland bird habitat and supporting the broader ecosystem across corn-growing areas, which in turn, also supports the long-term prosperity of corn growers. When pollinator habitat is made a priority, farmers often also see soil and water improvements in developed areas of their property. “NCGA looks forward to building this partnership to support long-term pollinator health,” said Mann. Pollinating insects are an essential component in global food production. Approximately one-third of all food and beverage products need pollination, yet many species of native pollinators and domesticated honeybees are in decline. Habitat that provides a diverse mixture of native flowering plants of different colors, shapes and sizes is what’s needed to support the life cycle of many pollinator species. “Not only is pollinator habitat good for the bees, butterflies and beetles, but it’s also excellent brood-rearing habitat for pheasants, quail and grassland songbirds,” said Chris Kallis, the director of corporate partnerships at Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever. “Pollinator habitat attracts soft-bodied insects that pheasant chicks and other ground-nesting chicks rely on for survival during the first 6-8 weeks of life. Through this new partnership with the NCGA, we can simultaneously support pollinators, pheasant broods and an increased bottom line for corn producers.” Schedule a Site Visit for Pollinator Habitat For more information about the pollinator partnership or to receive a complimentary field visit from a Farm Bill biologist, contact Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever by email at pollinator@pfqf.org or by calling Brent Rudolph, director of sustainability, at 517-980-4570. About Pheasants Forever Pheasants Forever, including its quail conservation division, Quail Forever, is the nation's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to upland habitat conservation. Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever have more than 140,000 members and 740 local chapters across the United States and Canada. Since creation in 1982, Pheasants Forever has spent $965 million on 560,000 habitat projects benefiting 20 million acres nationwide.",

    "title": "CommonGround Spotlights Ags Story with Food and Nutrition Experts",
    "content": "This week, CommonGround shared the story of American agriculture at the world’s largest meeting of food and nutrition experts at the Food and Nutrition Conference and Expo (FNCE), which was held online this year. With more than 10,000 registered dietitian nutritionists, nutrition science researchers, policymakers and healthcare providers in attendance, CommonGround volunteers attracted enthusiastic attention and engaged in meaningful dialogue that helped this influential audience delve further into how America’s farmers grow and raise the healthy foods they recommend. “FNCE provides a great venue for us to connect with people who directly impact the food choices of countless others,” said CommonGround volunteer Paula Linthicum, who farms in Laytonsville, Maryland. “The audience is receptive and appreciates the work that we do to provide a direct link to farming.” The activity, organized by CommonGround MidAtlantic with support from the National Corn Growers Association, brought an authentic voice to issues of interest to both consumers and agriculture, such as how the use of modern technologies and practices produces healthy, quality food options for our country and beyond. “Dietitians and nutritionists are getting asked production questions every day,” explained Laurie Adelhardt, program staff for CommonGround MidAtlantic. “When we provide straightforward answers and authentic resources to help these respected professionals explain the farm-to-table process, we reach a broader audience and increase consumer trust in American farmers.” In addition to Linthicum and Adelhardt, CommonGround volunteers Lauren Biegler, Lindsey Bowers, Danie Brandl, Amy Halfmann, Dawn Scheier, Jennie Schmidt, Elizabeth Van Hersh, Krista Willis and Addie Yoder participated in the event.",

    "title": "The Value of Corn in the Pet Food Industry",
    "content": "There are many benefits to including corn in your pet’s diet, but have you ever wondered about the benefits that your cat or dog brings to the corn industry? A comprehensive study unpacked the $30 billion U.S. retail pet food industry, thanks to the Institute for Feed Education and Research (IFEEDER), the Pet Food Institute and the North American Renderers Association. The study found that corn and corn gluten meal are the top two most used plant-based ingredients in pet food products. Corn is the dominant plant-based carbohydrate at 1,283,674 tons, and corn gluten meal is the dominant plant-based protein ingredient at 476,649 tons used on an annual basis. Thanks to Fido and Fluffy, the corn industry moved 1,958,061 tons of product, valued at a total of $438 million. “Farmers and farm-product processors sell $6.9 billion worth of products to pet food manufacturers every year that are used as ingredients. Sales made by farmers and processors of farm products to pet food manufacturers stimulates further upstream economic activity, leading to the purchase of $5.3 billion of materials and services from farm suppliers providing necessary inputs such as seed, fertilizer, fuel, labor, machinery and repairs to produce high-quality products that are used as pet food ingredients,” cites the report. Founded in 2009 by the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA), IFEEDER supports critical education and research initiatives that assure consumers a safe, healthy and sustainable food supply. The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) partners with IFEEDER and the AFIA on research projects as well as feed and food industry efforts, such as the Association of American Feed Control Officials’ petition on Corn Gluten Meal and the current partnership on the U.S. Roundtable on Sustainable Beef Feed Task Force. “This first-of-its-kind research shows that there are nearly 550 diverse ingredients used in U.S. pets’ diets to provide complete and balanced nutrition at price points that fit shoppers’ budgets,” said Robert Cooper, IFEEDER’s executive director. “Collaborations on research like the pet food study allow us to leverage our resources and share information that helps allied organizations, like the National Corn Growers Association, amplify its outreach with decision-makers and consumer influencers, so they are more informed about how important commodities, such as corn, are in producing safe and nutritious food for both humans and their four-legged companions.” You can listen to a podcast with RFD Today with Market Development Manager Michael Granché about expanding the use of corn in the Pet Market in areas beyond the food bowl here.

    "title": "NCGA to Administration Officials: Use of Higher Ethanol Blends Will Cut Gas Prices",
    "content": "As the White House met this week with executives from the oil and gas industry seeking help with high fuel prices, NCGA reminded administration officials that corn growers offer an immediate solution for lowering fuel prices. NCGA issued a response on social media, saying: “@WhiteHouse Trying to cut gas prices? How about blending more biofuels – homegrown ethanol costs less than gasoline, and even the small step of choosing a 15% ethanol blend at the pump today saves drivers 10 cents or more per gallon while cutting carbon emissions too.” This latest action is part of a larger campaign by NCGA to demonstrate the benefits of ethanol to policymakers. When it comes to fuel price concerns, ethanol currently costs less per gallon than gasoline, so blending more ethanol lowers fuel prices while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. NCGA has been working closely with Washington policymakers, reminding them that they can address these issues by: Ensuring consumers continue to have full market access to lower-cost and lower-emission 15% ethanol blends. Simply choosing a 15% ethanol blend at the pump today saves drivers up to 10 cents per gallon while cutting carbon emissions too. Increasing ethanol blending from 10% to 15% would lower transportation GHG emissions by 17.6 million metric tons per year, the equivalent of removing 3.8 million vehicles from the road. Issuing timely and strong renewable fuel blending requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The delayed 2022 RFS volume rule is needed now to support renewable fuel blending and replace additional expensive petroleum products with lower-priced and cleaner biofuels. Ensuring policy incentives, pathways and infrastructure support higher blends of ethanol. This includes using the pending revised vehicle standards rule to equitably incentivize low-emission flex-fuel vehicles that run on E85, which currently costs up to 20% less per gallon than gasoline. We should also take full advantage of ethanol’s clean octane value by increasing fuel octane standards and removing barriers to mid-level ethanol blends – such as through the Next Generation Fuels Act – to reduce emissions and improve fuel efficiency to save consumers money.

    "title": "#ICYMI: Cattlemen to Cattlemen Episode Focuses on Sustainable Synergies Between Corn and Beef",
    "content": "Beef and Corn: Working Together in a Sustainable System was the focus of a recent episode on the National Cattlemen Beef Association’s (NCBA) series Cattlemen to Cattlemen on RFD-TV. Panelists discuss sustainability practices on their farms, the benefits of next-generation feed products, how the ethanol industry has impacted corn and beef producers, and more. The episode was filmed at the Certified Angus Beef headquarters in Wooster, Ohio with panelists from the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), NCBA, and Certified Angus Beef (CAB). The episode aired on Tuesday, September 28th on RFD-TV at 8:30 PM ET. “It is important for corn farmers and beef producers to work together so both industries remain sustainable, both environmentally and economically, for the years to come,” said NCGA Chairman John Linder. “Beef cattle is one of our largest customers. One out of four bushels of added corn demand is due to beef and pork exports, with the beef industry providing $5.7 billion in corn value and consuming 1.2 billion bushels of grain. DDGS account for nearly 8 percent of total domestic corn usage.” NCBA's Cattlemen to Cattlemen is a television show for cattlemen created by cattlemen. The episode featuring corn growers is not scheduled yet but will air on RFD-TV. The show is hosted by Colorado cattle producer Kevin Ochsner. Panel participants include Bruce Cobb, Executive Vice President of Production for Certified Angus Beef; NCGA President and Ohio farmer John Linder; Brandon Hunnicutt, a Nebraska farmer and NCGA corn board member; Ohio Corn and Wheat Growers Association Vice President Ben Klick, who raises both corn and beef; and NCBA President-Elect and Minnesota farmer Don Schiefelbein. NCGA’s Market Development Action Team (MDAT) funded this initiative. You can watch this year’s episode here. You can watch last year’s episode here.",

    "title": "Research and Resources to Aid in the Fight Against Tar Spot",
    "content": "Growers across the country are reporting unprecedented incidences of tar spot this harvest season. When conditions are favorable for the disease, it can cause significant yield loss in susceptible corn hybrids. Tar spot was first detected in the U.S. in 2015 in northern Illinois and Indiana, and it has quickly spread through the Corn Belt. The disease causes significant losses for farmers’ livelihoods. Efforts to combat tar spot have been hindered by the difficulty of growing Phyllachora maydis—the fungus responsible for the disease—in a laboratory setting which, in turn, limits researchers’ capabilities to study and understand it. The National Corn Growers Association has two Action Teams, both armed with support from state checkoff dollars, focused on aiding the fight against tar spot. In 2019, the Sustainable Ag Research Action Team (SARAT)—along with Corteva Agriscience, Wyffels Hybrids, Illinois Corn Growers Association and Purdue University—helped to provide matching research funding towards the Foundation for Food & Agricultural Research’s (FFAR) Rapid Outcomes for Agricultural Research (ROAR) grant, which was awarded to a group of researchers for the study of tar spot on corn. The research team was comprised of plant pathologists from the University of Illinois, Iowa State University, Purdue University, Michigan State University, The Ohio State University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In the findings of their peer-reviewed article, Documenting the Establishment, Spread, and Severity of Phyllachora maydis on Corn, in the United States (Journal of Integrated Pest Management, Volume 11, Issue 1, 2020), the ROAR research group concluded that “coordinated efforts to monitor continued spread will be essential in ensuring that farmers and the agronomic community are educated in areas of greatest risk and in disease identification and disease management and mitigation techniques.” Growers can monitor 2021’s reported incidences of tar spot spread through Corn impPIPE mapping. If they see tar spot issues in their own fields, growers are strongly encouraged to help document those occurrences through Corn impPIPE’s reporting form. In addition to monitoring and documenting the disease this harvest season, best management practices can be employed to mitigate the spread of tar spot for next year. The Production Technology Access Action Team (PTAAT) has funded support for the Crop Protection Network (CPN) for the last two years. That network is a product of Land Grant Universities, and it provides unbiased crop protection information to farmers, educators and ag personnel. CPN’s Corn Disease Management: Tar Spot publication recommends that growers: Manage residue of the affected crop to reduce inoculum from overwintering, Rotate to other crops to reduce the primary tar spot inoculum, Avoid highly susceptible hybrids, and Investigate effective fungicides. These proactive strategies can help farmers get ahead of tar spot for the 2022 harvest season. NCGA will continue to promote further progress in the study and mitigation of tar spot in order to identify practices and tools for farmers that reduce the impact of this emerging disease.

    "content": "Autumn is here and the school year is well underway! Nourish the Future—a national education initiative developed by science teachers for science teachers—has put out the call for the next round of Teacher Leaders! This national leadership program is a year-long cohort experience especially designed for middle and high school teachers. The Teacher Leader Community (TLC) program offers participants opportunities to: Enhance professional development capacities to fit diverse audiences and venues. Become skilled in inquiry-based lesson design. Become a leader in exploring solutions with your students on issues affecting sustainability, climate, environment and food production. Expand a professional network to include teachers and industry experts from different states. Become a career coach for students. The national program is limited to 20 teachers, and the deadline for TLC III application is December 1, 2021. The leadership experience begins in January 2022 with a virtual celebration and introduction to the Nourish the Future (NTF) program. NCGA believes agriculture is a vital partner in engaging students in STEM concepts in ways that directly and indirectly impact their lives. Not only does teaching ag-based curriculum in the science classroom inspire students to solve real-world science issues, reaching students is critical to address the job gap in agriculture-related careers, many of which go unfilled. “Nourish the Future helps shine the spotlight on agriculture and all it has to offer science education. This initiative encourages the critical-thinking skills needed to solve real-world problems,” said Director of Research and Productivity at the National Corn Growers Association, Robyn Allscheid. “Our corn growers are interested in investing in education and know that the talented and passionate teachers involved in this Teacher Leader Community can make a difference in whether or not students feel inspired to consider a career path in agriculture.” Nourish the Future is made possible through the assistance of the National Corn Growers Association, the nation’s corn farmers, and their state corn checkoff programs.

Approaching sustainability as a collaborative effort is key for this to continue to be an opportunity for our industry and not an issue, as I know that it feels sometimes. Dusty Weis: Hello and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and future. I'm Dusty Weis and I'll be introducing your host, association CEO, Jon Doggett. From the fields of the corn belt to the DC beltway. We're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: After a long day in the field, there's no reward like a tender, juicy corn-fed cut of steak, and it's made all the sweeter by the fact that the US beef industry is one of the largest consumers of American corn.

Dusty Weis: And with that it's time to once again introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. And Jon, we live in a consumer-driven world and it can be a lot when you're focused on producing the best quality grain that you can. So, as puzzling as some of these trends may be to us at times, understanding what's really driving this behavior is an important part of running a successful farming operation. Jon Doggett: Dusty, they say the customer's always right. So, today this week combines are firing up across most of the corn belt, and we're going to focus on one of the biggest customers and that's the US beef industry. And we're going to learn and talk about what consumer-focused means to them and what we can do to help them be even better at all the great things that they already are doing. So, joining me today to help us all better understand what's driving the consumer these days is National Cattlemen's Beef Association's CEO, Collin Woodall, and Nicole Erceg Certified Angus Beef's communications director. Nicole, Collin, welcome. Nicole Erceg: Thanks for having us. Collin Woodall: Appreciate the opportunity, Jon. Jon Doggett: So, it's lunchtime here in DC and by the way, I haven't had lunch yet, but since we're going to talk about beef, it seems it's only appropriate we start off the conversation. What is your favorite beef dish? Nicole, we're going to start with you. Nicole Erceg: Well, for me, man, it's probably anything our chefs put in front of me. I love beef, but I'm a west coast gal, grew up in Oregon. So, my favorite cut of beef is a tri-tip. That's one of my favorite things to cook. It's what we served at our wedding. I'm never going to turn down tri-tip. Jon Doggett: All right, Collin. Collin Woodall: Jon, for me, it's the ribeye. I could eat my weight in rib eyes, but more specifically is any time you can find a nice ribeye cap, grilled. Man, I'm in heaven. Dusty Weis: And guys, if you have any favorite recipes that you want to share, go ahead and fire that over to us later, we can actually drop that in the episode description with link to your individual organization and anyone listening can cook up your favorite and beef dish right at home. If they feel like it. Jon Doggett: And all you guys did was make me even more hungry, but I'm with you, Collin, I'm a ribeye guy, always have been, and maybe that's what we'll do this weekend. So, Collin, you've got a big job at a very big organization. So, give us an overview of NCBA and your scope of work for the cattle producers of this country. Collin Woodall: The National Cattlemen's Beef Association is the oldest and largest national trade association representing US cattle producers. We've been around since 1898. In fact, today I'm sitting in our headquarters office in Denver, Colorado, and just out my window, I'm looking at a bunch of rooftops that a 100 years ago was a ranch of the very first president of this association. So, we are still very close to home and still very producer-focused. Now we've had various names over the years and ultimately we became the National Cattlemen's Beef Association in 1996. And that is when the National Cattlemen's Association joined forces with the beef industry council of the National Livestock and Meat Board to then form in NCBA. And while we look at the entire beef supply chain and represent components of the entire beef supply chain, our focus is on the producer, whether that's a cow-calf producer, a seed stock producer, a cattle feeder, those who are, as we like to say, getting manure on their boots every day, producing high-quality beef. Collin Woodall: And the reason why we can produce the high-quality beef that we can is because of the great corn that your members grow, Jon. And that's why this partnership has been so productive over the years and why it's so important and why having the opportunity to be with you here today is a really good one to talk more about that. Our focus is again on the producer, but at the same time in the work that we're doing, we have to have eyes on all components of this beef supply chain. And we need to what the consumer's thinking. Collin Woodall: We need to know what's going on in the retail meat case. We need to know what the restaurants are dealing with. We need to know what the packers and processors are dealing with. And we have to make sure that everybody who is supplying a good to us, whether that's equipment, whether that is credit, whether that is feed the different veterinary drugs that we do is also a big component of what NCBA does. And so that's why we like to say that we represent this industry from farm to fork or from pasture to plate. Jon Doggett: Well and for purposes of full disclosure, my family's been a long-time member of your organization. And in fact, many years ago, I worked for the National Cattleman's Association before it became the NCBA. So, Nicole, Certified Angus Beef, that's probably one of the greatest marketing stories ever told by the commodity world. How'd that come to be? And how do you amplify that message? Nicole Erceg: I love that best marketing story ever told. We wouldn't consider ourselves a commodity, more of a beef brand, but for anyone who's not familiar with the Certified Angus Beef brand, we are the original brand of Angus beef. We're based in Wooster, Ohio. And we are owned and led by family, farmers and ranchers. So, Angus ranchers are the ones that lead our business, that own our business, but we consider ourselves more than just Angus beef, because only the very best beef makes our cut. We have 10 standards for quality that guarantee any time that you see our logo out there and you get certified Angus beef, that it's going to be tender, juicy and flavorful, whether you are cooking at home or you're dining at one of the best steakhouses. When it comes to what our brand does. I mean, like I said, we're owned by ranchers, but we're the idea of an Angus breeder and it all started with him having a bad steak in a steakhouse in the 1970s. Nicole Erceg: And he thought, man, if consumers are looking and buying Angus beef and it has a bad reputation and they're having a bad eating at experience, that's going to impact how I can sell my cattle. And he wrote a letter and kind of designed the organization that we have today. So, we've been around for more than 40 years. We serve cattlemen by focusing on the end beef consumer. So, my team would talk to people across the supply chain from producers to that end consumer, but we know that the only new money in the beef business is in the wallets of the people who are eating our product. Nicole Erceg: So, we serve cattlemen by serving that end consumer, giving them tools to cook and eat and enjoy beef. And also taking the guest work out of finding the best beef in the meat case. To put us into scale for anyone who's not familiar with our brand, we market about 1.2 billion pounds of beef a year. Represent about 20% of the fed cattle supply. And in terms of serving producers in benefiting producers, because that's what our brand is all about, we put about a million dollars of premiums in the pockets of producers per week. So, our brand generates about $92 million a year in group premiums that cattlemen get for raising the best. Jon Doggett: Okay. So, at corn, we feel some of that consumer pressure from time to time, but the truth is corn is several steps removed from the average consumer. That's a lot different for you guys. You're about as consumer-facing as it gets. Knowing that, what are some of the consumer trends you're following right now, Nicole? Nicole Erceg: So, I would say the number one consumer trend, and whether you want to call it a trend or a mainstay is flavor and taste. That's why people buy beef. That's what draws them to beef. And I would say, Jon, corn is a key ingredient in our product, because you get great-tasting beef through marbling and manned corn-fed cattle, they are the ones that marble. So, we are a brand that's built around flavor and delivering on flavor and quality and that juicy, tender goodness that beef is known for. But we also know that consumer expectations around beef are expanding. It's not enough to just have a good-tasting product, especially as we look generationally, we need to deliver a good-tasting product that also has a great experience and a great story. People want to know that they can eat beef and not feel bad about it, that they can feel good about what we're doing for the environment, how that animal was raised and how that product got to them when they put it on their table. Jon Doggett: Collin, what are some of the consumer trends that you're looking at from your side of the industry? Collin Woodall: Well, Nicole definitely hit on a key one and that is flavor. I mean the flavor of beef, what we provide the consumer is why we have such a successful industry and why people keep coming back. But when you look at some of the other trends that we're following, a lot of it is this desire for more local product. And that was a result of what we saw throughout the COVID pandemic. People wanting to find something local. And I think that's not only an opportunity for us to just better showcase what we do on the land to have a closer relationship with the consumer, but it's also going to provide a lot of opportunities for our producers to say that they can take an additional step or take responsibility for an additional step in processing their cattle and doing something, whether that's freezer beef, whether that's local farmer's markets or looking at some more regional or local type brands. Collin Woodall: And I think that's going to continue to grow here over the next several years. I think that is a fad or a trend that is here to stay, not just a flash in the pan because of COVID. So, we're excited about that. COVID kind of brought around a bit of a beef Renaissance for us. When you look at where we were before the pandemic, we really concerned about fake meat, whether that was Beyond product, Impossible product, plant-based products, or even looking at what is going on as far as cell-based or the test tube beef, if you will. And we were really concerned. I thought that this was a true threat to our industry, and spent a lot of time working on that. Then the pandemic hit. And all of a sudden we saw this amazing response from the consumer because you'd go to a grocery store and that meat case would be absolutely just cleaned out. Collin Woodall: There was no beef to be found. And that showed quite clearly that while yes, there are some alternatives out there, the consumer is still with us and it's back to that taste. So, I think that we're going to continue to be able to capitalize on that, look at some of these local opportunities, but also start focusing more on outreach to the consumer regarding more convenient ways to prepare beef, because that trend that we saw throughout the pandemic has maintained as far as people eating more beef at home. And that's also something that we're going to be able to make a lot of hay out of as an industry. Dusty Weis: Collin and Nicole, I'm really intrigued by the fact that being two big industry groups that both of your groups have really sort of embraced this move among consumers for more transparency and more information about the food that they're eating. And for me, I grew up in a small town out in corn country. And when we needed some cuts of steak, dad would drive up the road to Hoesly's Meats and buying it from a butcher that he knew, that came from a farm just down the road. And it was really a very transparent operation. You knew right where your food was coming from. And so in a lot of ways, I feel like this broader movement among consumers now is scratching the itch that we've heard from growers for a long time, that, oh, well, people don't know where their food comes from. People don't have an interest. They think that food comes from the grocery store. What factors do you think matter the most when families are trying to figure out what's right for them and their family? Collin Woodall: Well, I think there's several things that they consider. One, having that face-to-face interaction with somebody who actually produced the at beef is key. Whenever you can have an interaction or a business transaction, rather with somebody that you can look at eyeball to eyeball, it makes all the difference in the world. You build a relationship, you can hear their story. And as we see Americans wanting to know more about where their beef comes from, they're asking the questions about how it's raised, our impact on the environment, et cetera. You can get that by having that one-on-one relationship. So, there's a lot that we can gain there, but we also have to be very careful that while yes, there is a segment of our consumers that wants that interaction, not everybody necessarily does and not everybody necessarily wants to pay for it. Collin Woodall: So, we have to make it very clear that beef that you get here in the United States is safe. It's high quality, it's nutritious, regardless of whether you got it from the farmer or rancher up the road, or you went to your local supermarket. And I think that's something that we're very proud of as an industry is that we have multiple outlets for somebody to go to procure beef for their family. And we know that they can have a great eating experience, again, regardless of which choice they make as far as where they purchase it. Nicole Erceg: Yeah. I think when we talk about consumers, sometimes we end up turning it into this mythical mystery type of creature and forget that we're consumers. Consumers are just people. They're home cooks, they're moms, they're backyard barbecuers, they're business guys that are going out to have dinner. And like you said, Collin some of them want more information about where their food comes from. And some of them just want to have a great night out, or mom just wants to get dinner on the table and have kids eat it. So, I think we need to be able to have that information available for those consumers that want it. We absolutely have to supply that story for some of them that really want to know that further information, but also be able to deliver a good product in a convenient way for those that just want to have beef for dinner. I think for us, one of the ways that I really liked what you said about relationships, Collin, because that's what I think this is. The better one-on-one relationship that we can build with our consumer. Nicole Erceg: I think the better they're going to feel about the product that they're buying. And I think one of the ways that we do that is a brand is talk to people like their people and try to that connection to them. But it's also arming the people that are having that conversation. So, we can't get everyone on a ranch. We can't put a rancher in every grocery store for them to have that kind of connection or that experience that you talked about, Dusty, that you had growing up, but we will take meat managers out on the ranch. We will arm those types of people with the stories of producers or wait staff that are at a restaurant. I've taken wait staff members out to a ranch to experience where our product comes from. So, that when a consumer is asking that question of the guy behind the meat counter or the gal that's taken their order for dinner, that they can tell a story of where our product comes from. And one that makes people feel really good about it and connected to it. Jon Doggett: For so long we've, in agriculture have said, people don't know where their food comes from. And now some of my growers are saying, people want to know where their food's coming from. And the neat thing about that is we have a great story to tell. We have nothing to hide. Do we have a few problems? Yes, we do. Any industry does, but we have so many things that we can be absolutely proud and talk to up consumers about. And I think that's really kind of the neat thing that we have an opportunity and, Collin, to your point. Certainly, the pandemic has allowed the spotlight to fall on us in a really good way. And we can have that discussion. I want to turn to a different topic and before we get too deep into it, I have to ask a question. Have each of you had fake meat? Nicole Erceg: Yep. Collin Woodall: Yes. Unfortunately. Nicole Erceg: You got to do a taste test. You got to know. Jon Doggett: Yeah. You got to know. I've tried it three times and I have to say that it's not bad if you have a really, really thick bun and you put a lot of cheese on it and ketchup up and mustard, mayonnaise, maybe some A.1. Sauce, pretty thick slice of onion, tomato, and some peppers. And it's not so bad. Collin Woodall: Under that scenario, Jon, a piece of cardboard would taste pretty good too. Jon Doggett: Well, maybe it was, I don't know. But the thing is, I know where a real hamburger comes from. I don't know where that other hamburger comes from. And in our industry people get worried about biotech corn. What's in this other stuff? I mean, I don't want to disparage somebody else's product, but I would like them to be as transparent as we've had to be and be as transparent as you folks have had to be. But how big do you project this category to get and what kind of impact is it going to create for your industry? And Collin we'll start with you this time. Collin Woodall: Yeah, Jon, it's here to stay. There's no doubt about it, because there is some consumer demand out there for that type of product. So, as long as the consumer demand is there, there will be companies that provide it. I think what you see is folks like Impossible and Beyond are not having quite the pickup that they had anticipated. You've had restaurants who have taken on those products for their menu and have since let them go. And a lot of that is because that demand is still pretty small and I think it's going to remain that way. It's going to be there. We have to keep our eye on the ball. We can't just ignore them. We have to make sure that we're continuing to tell our story, because the interesting thing about this product is that they market their product, not on the attributes of their own patties or crumbles or whatever it may be. Collin Woodall: They market themselves often disparaging us, which is a very interesting approach in the marketing world. And you look at what we do, what Nicole does at CAB. We market ourselves on the great qualities and attributes of our product. We don't go out and just disparage chicken. That's not how we do it. We talk about our great taste, the fake meat companies aren't doing that. And I think as we talk about this transparency, as we talk about more of what we do on farms and ranches, all of a sudden we start to take that air out of their balloon a little bit. And we saw that during the pandemic, which is why I say something that we thought was really an existential threat to the future of this industry is something we're going to have deal with, but it's not necessarily going to take us down. Nicole Erceg: I think the thing that's cool about working in the beef industry is we are the original plant-based protein and that we have a really good story to tell around what cattle do and the great product that they create. I think the emergence of these products and these brands just solidify for me that the protein category is one that is a popular place to be and a profitable place to be. And to me imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. One of the ways that I look at this, I mean, we are the very first brand of Angus beef. We use the G1 a lot because we are the very first grade schedule in the packing plants. We are the first ones market beef this way 40 years ago. Today there's, I think, more than 150 grade schedules. Nicole Erceg: And about 80 of those are Angus brands. That doesn't mean that we're not successful as a brand. We still market 1.2 billion pounds of beef. So, as I think about this product category, I kind of think of it in the way that we would look at other brands or other even categories within beef or our brand is there's a place for them at the table. There's a consumer that wants them, but that doesn't limit our ability to serve those consumers and to really still be highly successful in this protein marketplace. Jon Doggett: The way you both have talked about plant-based protein is very similar to how we have been approaching the emergence of electric vehicles. And we have a product called ethanol that at a higher percentage in the tank, the less carbon that is going to emit and all we want is the same thing you would like. And that is transparency. And judge us by the same standards you judge our competition. I'm not afraid of our competition if it's a level playing field and being transparent. So, it's interesting that we both are coming at this from very much the same direction. So, one other thing, the pandemic has certainly affected how and where we eat. So much of what we were consuming before the pandemic was in the restaurant. Now it's not. What have you learned over the last 18 months? And how's that changed about how you go about your business? Nicole Erceg: Oh gosh. I think that's hard to sum up. We could do a whole podcast just about that, but I would say one major thing for us is obviously the shift from eating out to more beef at the grocery store. Saw a lot of people shift into purchasing from that retail space and cooking at home. And that was really good for us, because beef can be kind of an intimidating product. As you look at the number of cuts, trying to figure out what to buy. So, people got to experiment more with beef, and that was really good. And we are seeing lots benefits from that. People who are continuing to cook at home and people who are continuing to experiment with beef and use it more as a staple on their plate. I will tell you for us a lot of people talked about how quiet and how much time they had during quarantine. Nicole Erceg: My communications team has never been busier because man, our social views sky rocketed. People were out there looking for content on how do I cook at home? How do I cook beef? What are recipes that are available? We honestly had just a couple videos this last week that hit a million views that from people are out here looking for this content. And that has changed in a good way. I think one thing that we're still weathering is the impact that the pandemic has had on food service. This last 18 months has been a really rough time to be a restaurateur. And that has been a challenge for us. We've definitely seen some folks rebound and shift their business practices. One thing that I think we're really excited about is during this, we're not necessarily seeing a shift away from high quality meat, but you are still seeing restaurateurs struggle. Nicole Erceg: And that's been a big piece of our business. Food service and restaurant sales were about 30% for us. And when you close that down, we definitely had a lot of that shift into grocery stores, but not completely. And so we're looking forward to things picking back up again, and our restaurant community being able to recover. I do have to say that for us as a brand, we were very fortunate in how we weathered the pandemic. And I mean, it was our third best year ever in terms of sales. So, whether people are at home or they're out, we know that they want to eat really good beef. Collin Woodall: Yeah. We spend a lot of time, Jon, doing market research to find out what the consumer's thinking, what they want, what they're expecting to do moving forward. And the majority of Americans are expecting to continue to eat more meals at home. And the majority of them are saying that beef will continue to be a part of those home meals. So, that's a pretty significant departure of what we saw where most of our product was being sold through food service. The challenge then comes, is helping the consumer look at the many different ways that you can incorporate beef into daily dishes. It's more than just a hamburger or a rib eye every night. I'd be more than happy to take that rib eye every night, but that's not your average American. And so making sure that we did two things, one is to teach them to properly handle and cook beef was first and foremost, because as Nicole talked about, it was a bad beef eating experience that led to the advent of CAB. Collin Woodall: And a lot of times it only takes that one bad beef eating experience to turn somebody off. So, we needed to make sure that the consumer knows how to cook our product. And so we spent a lot of time with cooking classes, online cooking classes, cooking videos, in order to help the consumer with that. And then really start to open up our recipe library to show that it can be steak on a salad. It can be ground beef in a pasta dish. There are many ways to incorporate beef. So that way you have some variety. And much like the CAB experience, we have just been blown away with the amount of traffic that has been driven towards our videos, our online cooking classes in our recipe library. As an association, we are also a contractor to the National Beef Checkoff. Collin Woodall: And in that role, we spend a lot of time with recipe development and making sure that we can get the word out through the beef that what's for dinner campaign and assets to make that happen. But another thing of course is where will food service, where will restaurants really play into Americana moving forward. And one of the things that we have seen that we're working with is how restaurants are now doing take home steaks. A great example is Texas Roadhouse. Texas Roadhouse has been a great purveyor of beef for years. Now, you can go to a Texas Roadhouse and enjoy a steak, or you can order your beef online from Texas Roadhouse. And I think we may see more of that moving forward. Dusty Weis: Collin, I wanted to come back to something that you said there for a second, because I was one of those consumers during the pandemic who did a lot more cooking at home. And by perusing some of the new information that was out there online, it might have even been from one of your organizations. I came to realize that it is possible to over marinade a steak, like you leave it in the marinade too long and it's bad for it, breaks it down and makes it grainy and not tasty. And so you talk about educating the public about their bad meat handling practices. What are some of the other ways that I have been screwing up in the kitchen when I cook with meat? Collin Woodall: For a product that is as great tasting as it is, we do have a lot of issues that can make it not so great tasting. And you just keyed on a big one and that is over marinating. If you leave it in there too long, it does, it gets mealy. It gets kind of mushy and it is not a good meat-eating experience. Probably the biggest thing is either undercooking or over-cooking the beef, especially when you're talking about a steak. And it is easy to do. Most people don't really have that much experience cooking steaks at home. And so making sure that they can get that nice, medium, medium-rare, rather than something that is well done, especially on a nice high cut, like a rib eye is something that we have to try to impart upon these consumers. Collin Woodall: Some people like a well-done piece of meat, that's fine. We're going to let them have it. But if that's not what you're expecting and that's what you get, then all of a sudden you realize, oh, this is not so good. And then of course, probably one of the biggest things that is always a concern for us is just the handling of our product to make sure that you are handling the raw product appropriately, making sure it's refrigerated or frozen, making sure you're washing your hands, that you're not contaminating surfaces. And also how do you handle those leftovers? Assuming that there are leftovers. In my house there's never any beef leftovers, but if there are, making sure that you're handling that well too, because one of our challenges as an industry is the fact that we still have foodborne pathogens that we have to deal with. And we continue to find ways to get better at that, but we need the consumer's help in making sure that we're not getting anybody sick. Dusty Weis: Nicole, what's your favorite trick for getting the perfect medium-rare steak? Nicole Erceg: Oh, well I would say start with Certified Angus Beef, and the thing I was going to ask you, Dusty, is are you resting your steaks? Dusty Weis: I barely have time to rest myself. What's resting a steak, Nicole? Nicole Erceg: Yes. So, I would say this is probably one of the biggest mistakes we see, because you get that steak off the grill and you are just hungry and you're ready to cut into it. You need to temp it for what you want to get to medium-rare. You want it at about 135, which means I'm going to pull it off the grill, maybe 130 for my taste, and then you're going to let it sit there. I put mine on a cutting board, let it sit, leave it alone. I got to walk away. I'm not a big fan of tenting. There's all kinds of resting techniques, but I'm just going to let it sit, because you need to let those juices redistribute into the meat. And so that way, when you cut into it, you're still going to get that juicy flavor. Have you ever cut into a steak and the juices run all across your plate? Dusty Weis: All the time. Nicole Erceg: Yeah. That's the good stuff you want that in your mouth, not messing up with your potatoes or anything. So, you got to let that steak rest for depending on your cut of meat, but five to 10 minutes, even for some cuts and just let it sit there and you'll have a much better eating experience. Dusty Weis: That requires a degree of willpower I don't know if I'm capable of, Nicole. Nicole Erceg: It's hard. That's why I think a lot of people skip that step, but man, it's important. Jon Doggett: Just as important to how you cook the steak, it's to be able to have patience. And I don't have patience sometimes to let it rest. I know you need to, but sometimes I'm just too hungry. Nicole Erceg: Oh, I'm with you, but it's worth it. If you plan that into your cooking strategy and you know that I'm going to have to let it sit there. But my husband is the really good cook in our house. And I have been the person like sitting there on the counter drooling. Like, can we cut into it yet? Nope. Let it rest. It's worth it. I think the other interesting thing out of the pandemic that we saw when we're talking about techniques around beef is that a lot of people went and stocked up. Did any of you guys stock up your freezers? You're buying all this food from the grocery store. Nicole Erceg: You get a whole bunch of it when you can, you throw it in the freezer. So, we created a lot of content around how to properly dethaw meat and how to do that safely. And there's different techniques and tricks for doing that to make sure that you're still taking care of your product, how to freeze it properly and then how to unthaw it properly. Dusty Weis: Oh, I bet you, I was doing that wrong. Nicole Erceg: Well, if you head to Certified Angus Beef, our YouTube channel, our test kitchen chefs. They've got a video for you, Dusty. Dusty Weis: We'll check it out. Jon Doggett: All right, good. This has been wonderful so far. And so let's focus for a minute on sustainability, a term that we have heard for years and years and years. It is now something that all of agriculture is dealing with. So, we don't always know what that means to consumers, but how are beef producers responding to what the consumers are saying about sustainability and how are you tackling that? Collin Woodall: Yeah, Jon, that is a huge issue. And I think we need to start out first off by just saying sustainability is not going away. It is a topic that is here to stay. It's a topic that we have to engage in, because as you said, the consumers are asking questions and the response, when you bring up the issue of sustainability among beef producers is rather interesting, even today, because we have a lot of producers who say, yes, this is an area where we need to take the lead. Collin Woodall: We need to be very clear in what we're doing and show the consumer that they can feel good about eating our product. We have some of our members who just kind of get mad about this discussion of sustainability and say, well, you're just talking about more room rules and regulations on how I run my operation. And then you get a few that because of the kind of uncertain nature of sustainability, you had mentioned, a lot of people aren't even sure necessarily how to define sustainability, their eyes kind of just gloss over and they say, okay, I'm going to hang out here until we talk about the next subject. Collin Woodall: You get all three of those responses. And what we are doing is trying to take a step forward and really focus on that first group and say, this is about showcasing the great work that we've already done as an industry, because cattle production today is not the same as it was five years ago, much less 50 years ago. And it is because of this commitment to continual improvement and continual improvement is how we have gotten better and how we will continue to get better. Collin Woodall: And when you talk about cattle producers, who, in some case cases where we have members that can trace their ranch's lineage back to Spanish land grants in California, or to land grants from king George in the original 13 colonies, if that's not sustainability, I don't know what is. But being able to take that story and put it in a way that the consumer really understands that when it comes to cattle production, we are all about clean air, clean water, healthy soils, good grass and the welfare of our animals. Because if we don't have any of that, we don't have an industry. We don't have anything that we can depend upon. And so taking the leadership role that we have and putting out some goals regarding sustainability is something we're excited about, because we can tell that story, I think in a much better way now. Nicole Erceg: Yeah. Collin, I think you captured the producer sentiment around it. There's some people that sustainability is the S word and there's other folks that embrace it as an opportunity. I think there is an opportunity here for us to further connect and deliver on our product to consumers. For us it's an investment in consumer trust. It's about delivering on what our consumers want and what they need. And I don't think anyone likes being told how to do their job. And that's why there's, I think, some hesitancy around it. And I don't think that's what consumers are asking is it not that they want to dictate what happens on the farmer ranch. It's just that they want to feel good about how their product was produced. And I think the great opportunity here is that we have a really good story to tell, it's just quantifying it. Nicole Erceg: And sometimes it's telling that story in a way that connects with our consumers is not going to look as complex or as data-centric as it is when we talk about it amongst ourselves. As I've looked at our role as a brand and helping tell this story, it's quantifying some of what the industry has already done, and we can market on it as an attribute for our product. So, I think there's opportunity here. It's just being able to capitalize on it and too, it's beginning to quantify some of the things that I don't want to say we haven't focused on, because when I talk to producers about it, if you add ask them about sustainability, it's just a part of their everyday lives, man. Nicole Erceg: It's just good business to take care of the grasslands. It's just good business to build good water resources. And a lot of those things turn into sequestering greenhouse gas emissions. So, it's just learning to think about these things a little bit differently, using some different language and vernacular of how we communicate about it. But I think there's a great story to tell here of what cattle ranchers are doing. And also what corn farmers are doing to put a great product that's been raised in a very responsible way in front of our consumers. Jon Doggett: So, I need to bring this a little closer to home and discuss the role of feed in meeting consumer needs. So, with that, Nicole, how important is sourcing sustainably produced feed to your side of the industry? Nicole Erceg: Yeah, so I think it's really interesting as you talk about the definition of sustainability and when you ask consumers what it means to them, you get all kinds of answers back. It can range from food waste or the number one thing we hear is animal welfare, it can be beef's impact on the environment. But one of the things that shows up in our research is what cattle eat. And so I think as we look at telling a sustainability story, being able to tell some of the story of where the food comes from that cattle eat is absolutely important to telling a holistic sustainability story. Collin Woodall: Yeah. From our perspective, I mean the corn industry is a lot like what we're doing here in the cattle industry. And that is looking at the way that we improve our product. We use the tools available as far as genetic improvements to make sure that that corn variety to today we know is nowhere near what it was 50 years ago or a 100 years ago. And that has been because of this commitment to continual improvement. We know there's a tremendous amount of research going on today for even more corn varieties that could do things such as helping reduce the methane emissions coming out of cattle. Collin Woodall: And so we know that that sustainable approach to corn production, whether that's the genes of the plant itself, whether it's all of the conservation practices that are put in towards management of the land, management of the fields, you guys are a key component. You have to be healthy, because we rely on you. If you are not healthy, if you are not sustainable, then all of a sudden that very important feed source that we rely on is gone. And that's why this discussion of sustainability has to be one that we are all engaged in. This can't be just sustainability of what's going on with that one bovine animal. It has to be the sustainability of everybody who's helping produce that bovine and you and your members, Jon, are a big, big component of that. Jon Doggett: Collin, you mentioned something a little bit ago about how much your industry has changed in the last five, 10 years. And Chris Edgington, who is our incoming president has said, and he's absolutely right. If you haven't been on a corn farm in the last five years, you haven't been on a corn farm. And I think that's the important thing that we all are discussing, not only this podcast, but all of the discussions we've had in the commodity world is don't look at snapshots, look at trends. And the trend is just so significantly good. And we need to celebrate that. Beyond that, what are some of the other expectations that you folks have of your feed suppliers like us? What else can we be doing to help you in your industry? And Nicole we'll start with you. Nicole Erceg: I think sustainability is a team sport. This is not something that we can tackle as individuals, as individual businesses, as even individual segments of the industry. I think collaboration and being at the table and being in each other's corner on some of this, because like Collin said, this is not about that individual bovine or that farm. As we look at the beef supply chain and putting a product on our consumer's plate that we can feel really good about how it got from gate to plate and that process and its impact on our environment. It starts on a corn farm somewhere. It's a complex process. And I think the more collaboration we have, I think it's only going to make us better and it's only going to make our stories stronger. And I think it's key for when you guys get better, we get better and vice versa. So, I think approaching sustainability as a team, as a collaborative effort, is key for this to continue to be an opportunity for our industry and not an issue. As I know that it feels sometimes. Collin Woodall: Jon, when you look at sustainability, there's that natural inclination to just worry about the environmental component of sustainability, but sustainability is so much more. We have to look at it from the sustainability of local communities. So, if your members aren't healthy, if my members aren't healthy, then those local communities aren't healthy. But really when you boil it down to sustainability, if we can't be profitable as agriculturalists, then nothing else really matters, because we won't have the operations there to do this work and to help us be sustainable. And I think that's where the relationship between the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattleman's Beef Association has been, is, and will continue to be important in the work that we do together, especially in Washington DC, because we have to engage with lawmakers. We have to engage with the administration to protect ourselves and tell our stories. Collin Woodall: We're on the same team when it comes to things like tax policy and trying to push back anything that would eliminate the step up and basis, for example, or that would lower the exemption amounts for the estate tax, the death tax. That's something our teams are working together on, as we speak to make sure that we're doing everything we can to protect these family farms, these family operations. Things such as working to ensure the new WOTUS rule that's going to come back into play here with the new administration does not return us back to where we were with that original 2015 Obama rule. Collin Woodall: So, the relationship between our two organizations is much more substantial than just you producing the feed for our cattle. It's about that true interaction and cooperation, working to protect and defend ourselves from a lot of ill-conceived ideas when it comes to Congress and the white house, and that's regardless of administration or regardless of party, it's just about being one group, because we know that there's fewer few of us in agriculture working together to just be an advocate for what we do. Jon Doggett: Collin, you and I both ran our DC operations before we became CEOs of our respective organizations. And you and I have had this conversation dozens and dozens of times, because you've heard from your folks and I've heard from my folks, you need to work together. And I don't know if there's ever been a week that some of your folks aren't working with some of my folks on something that benefits our industries. Collin Woodall: You're exactly right. I was just talking to the head of my DC office this morning and he was mentioning some conversations that he had had with your team as well. And that just illustrates this continued interaction, coordination, cooperation that we see among our two groups in going out and protecting ourselves. Because we have to look at where are our strengths and weaknesses. We know that we're going to look at Illinois. There's going to be some districts in Illinois where you as the corn growers are going to have many more people on out that can engage with a member of Congress that we will on the cattle side. But when we go to west Texas, that may be a much different thing. And so making sure that we could really leverage each other's strengths and our influence is key to making sure that we have those votes. Collin Woodall: And again, votes among Republicans and Democrats alike to step up and protect what's going on in family farms and ranches. This issue of sustainability is one that's very important to president Biden. He's talked a lot about climate change sustainability, but when we go back and we look at this tax discussion that's going on, there are some proposals out there that we know will result in farms and ranches being split up or sold. And in the world today, especially with every other farmer and rancher being under that same tax liability, being able to transfer that to somebody else in agriculture, probably a slim chance of that. It's going to go to a developer. It's going to go somebody who's just going to have some hunting assets and not necessarily have production to agriculture. So, that's very counter to what the president is trying to achieve. He needs green space and your members, my members, all of us in agriculture provide that green space. And that coordination that we have between our organizations, Jon, is what's going to really help us protect our membership. Jon Doggett: Well, thank you so much National Cattlemen's Beef Association, CEO, Collin Woodall and Nicole Erceg, Certified Angus Beef's communication director. This has been a wonderful discussion and I've certainly enjoyed it. And as a Montana ranch kid whose family still produces beef, including Angus beef.

    "title": "NCGA to EPA: Ethanol Needed to Lower Greenhouse Gas Emissions",
    "content": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should focus on opening pathways for all low-carbon fuels and technologies, such as ethanol, as it seeks to lower greenhouse gas emissions, the National Corn Growers Association explained to EPA in comments submitted today. The agency’s written comments come as EPA hears from stakeholders on its proposed rule to set more stringent greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles for model year 2023 to 2026. Unfortunately, the role that higher blends of low-carbon ethanol can play in meeting new standards was conspicuously absent from EPA’s proposal. “EPA missed an opportunity in this proposal to broaden the solutions that reduce transportation emissions by beginning a transition to low-carbon, high-octane fuels to advance climate, air quality and environmental justice goals with these and future standards,” NCGA President John Linder stated in the comments. “Furthermore, alternative fuel vehicles such as flex-fuel vehicles, which have the potential to reach zero emissions, should be equitably incentivized through vehicle standards rules.” Higher octane fuel is an essential tool for automakers to meet revised standards, but higher octane must also be clean octane to meet emission reduction goals, Linder noted. “For automakers to use new technologies and enhanced engines to meet stringent standards, they need updated fuel that enables new vehicles and fuels to work as a system to enhance GHG reductions,” he said. “Clean octane from today’s ethanol is 50% lower in GHG emissions than gasoline and replaces the most harmful hydrocarbon aromatics to improve air quality and prevent adverse health impacts.” EPA is expected to finalize revised vehicle standards later this year or early next year. NCGA has also pursued legislation in Congress that would couple a higher-octane fuel standard with low-carbon ethanol to lower greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, Rep. Cheri Bustos (I.L.) reintroduced the Next Generation Fuels Act (H.R. 5089) this summer. The bill would take advantage of higher ethanol blends to meet low-carbon, high-octane standards for fuels and vehicles.",

    "content": "This week, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is highlighting the benefits of corn in pet food and packaging opportunities at the Petfood Forum in Kansas City, Missouri. This is the pet food industry’s largest event, with exhibitors and attendees from various backgrounds including research and development, technology and packaging providers, ingredient suppliers and retailers. The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and the Kansas Corn Growers Association had a booth at the event to interact with these stakeholders. “It’s important for us to engage with the pet food industry and audience, because a recent study found that retail pet food is a $30 billion industry, with corn and corn gluten meal as the top two most used plant-based ingredients in pet food products,” said NCGA Market Development Manager Michael Granché. “This was an opportunity for us to not only discuss the benefits of corn in pet food, but also talk about the role corn can play beyond the bowl in applications such as pet food packaging and pet products.” While at the event, NCGA shared its corn in pet food materials, including technical research, fast facts, Corn MythBusters and the top 10 reasons to include corn in pet food. The information in the materials came from a study conducted by Kansas State University in which NCGA partnered with the Kansas Corn Growers Association to look at corn in pet food.

    "title": "Sustainable Synergies Between Corn and Beef Production Cattlemen to Cattlemen Episode Airs Next Week on RFD-TV",
    "content": "Beef and Corn: Working Together in a Sustainable System is the topic of the upcoming panel show on the National Cattlemen Beef Association’s (NCBA) series Cattlemen to Cattlemen on RFD-TV. Panelists will discuss sustainability practices on their farms, the benefits of next-generation feed products, how the ethanol industry has impacted corn and beef producers, and more. The episode was filmed at the Certified Angus Beef headquarters in Wooster, Ohio with panelists from the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), NCBA, and Certified Angus Beef (CAB). The episode will air on Tuesday, September 28th on RFD-TV at 8:30 PM ET. “It is important for corn farmers and beef producers to work together so both industries remain sustainable, both environmentally and economically, for the years to come,” said NCGA President John Linder. “Beef cattle is one of our largest customers. One out of four bushels of added corn demand is due to beef and pork exports, with the beef industry providing $5.7 billion in corn value and consuming 1.2 billion bushels of grain. DDGS account for nearly 8 percent of total domestic corn usage.” NCBA's Cattlemen to Cattlemen is a television show for cattlemen created by cattlemen. The episode featuring corn growers is not scheduled yet but will air on RFD-TV. The show is hosted by Colorado cattle producer Kevin Ochsner. Panel participants include Bruce Cobb, Executive Vice President of Production for Certified Angus Beef; NCGA President and Ohio farmer John Linder; Brandon Hunnicutt, a Nebraska farmer and NCGA corn board member; Ohio Corn and Wheat Growers Association Vice President Ben Klick, who raises both corn and beef; and NCBA President-Elect and Minnesota farmer Don Schiefelbein. NCGA’s Market Development Action Team (MDAT) funded this initiative. The episode will air on Tuesday, September 28th on RFD-TV at 8:30 PM ET. You can watch last year’s episode here.",

    "title": "Corn Continues Call for Research Projects Which Help Solve Aflatoxin Issues",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) announces a new round of research grants to help farmers manage aflatoxin issues. Letters of intent from principal investigators, co-principal investigators, and collaborators--not exceeding the $75,000 per year limit--will be accepted by the Aflatoxin Mitigation Center of Excellence (AMCOE) no later than October 15, 2021. For more information about the review process, evaluation criteria and program, click here. AMCOE’s Research Program will again offer grants for projects focused on solving profit-robbing aflatoxin issues for farmers. These grants, which will be awarded to researchers focusing on one of six priority areas, were designed by Southern corn checkoff boards to bring a unified approach to funding research projects across the region and will therefore favor research teams that include members from multiple states. The six priority areas for projects funded for 2022 are biological control, transgenic modification, plant breeding, amelioration technology, best management strategies and improved testing procedures. “Through the efforts of the Aflatoxin Mitigation Center for Excellence, substantial progress has been made in understanding and managing aflatoxin and other mycotoxins,” said Texas corn grower and AMCOE Committee Chair Charles Ring. “Working with Southern state grower associations including Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, Mississippi and North Carolina, NCGA administers AMCOE to create a united approach to aflatoxin research. Our primary goal is to deliver advanced strategies, tools and results to growers.” While corn farmers in Southern states experience aflatoxin challenges every year, these challenges may present themselves in any corn region of the United States when the crop comes under stress. Thus, the benefits of such research, particularly as outlined in the six priority areas, are truly national in scope. Proposals will be considered regardless of the parties’ geographic region. Any state wishing to provide additional funding for AMCOE is encouraged to do so. To learn more about AMCOE or corn research news, visit ncga.com/key-issues/other-topics/research.",

    "title": "NCGA Participates in UN Food Systems Summit Stakeholder Listening Session",
    "content": "Colorado farmer and Market Development Action Team (MDAT) member Troy Schneider recently delivered oral comments at a Stakeholder Listening Session of the UN Food Systems Summit convened by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of International Organization Affairs along with the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The session gave a platform for NCGA to outline our priorities for the upcoming Summit on September 23, 2021. “Americans today have access to one of the safest, most diverse, and most affordable food supplies in history, thanks in large part to the efficiency, productivity and innovation of U.S. agriculture enabled by technology and the United States’ robust science and risk-based regulatory system,” Schneider said. NCGA has been engaged in the Summit process through participation in multiple events leading up to the September event, including Independent Dialogues, USDA-hosted National Dialogues, and events surrounding the July Pre-Summit. As stated on the record by Schneider, corn grower priorities include: First, food systems need to take a holistic approach to address sustainability, which includes helping make farms agronomically and financially more sustainable. However, any recommendations from the Summit process need to be voluntary for adoption. Second, farmers must continue to have access to innovative technologies to produce food more sustainably. Biotechnology seeds and new breeding techniques have undoubtably allowed U.S. agriculture to increase its production efficiency while simultaneously improving land-use efficiency. Additionally, herbicides further enable the use of cover crops and no-till practices on corn acres – which has decreased soil erosion per acre by 58% from 1980 to 2015. Third, we believe more countries should adopt science-based decision-making processes. This approach increases yields for crop producers and can alleviate hunger in nations with varying levels of economic development. Fourth, the Summit needs to recognize that a rules-based system for agricultural trade will reduce market access barriers and is vital to achieving food security and sustainability on a global scale. Between now and September 23, NCGA will continue to communicate our priorities with leaders at USDA and State. We thank the Biden administration for their continued engagement and leadership on the efficiency, sustainability and safety of the U.S. food system.",

    "title": "EP. 24 - Former White Sox Outfielder Ron Kittle Recaps the MLB Field of Dreams game, with NCGA President John Linder",
    "content": "NCGA's involvement in the baseball game in Dyersville, Iowa was a \"stalk-off\" home run for corn, for MLB and for America. The Field of Dreams is an iconic movie for baseball fans and corn growers alike, and the image of an idyllic baseball diamond set amongst the Iowa corn stalks has endured now for decades. But this summer, the NCGA had the opportunity to be part of Major League Baseball’s plan to bring baseball back to that field in Dyersville. And on this episode, we’ll relive the event with Ron Kittle, former White Sox outfielder and 1983 AL Rookie of the Year, as well as NCGA President John Linder. Together with Jon and Dusty, they'll revisit the planning that made this special event possible, share stories from game day and explore Ron's career in Major League baseball. Plus, John Linder shares the tale of his run-in with actor Kevin Costner at the game itself. Direct Share Link Ron Kittle: If nobody knew what the Corn Growers Association is all about, they do now, due to that game out there. It was absolutely perfect. I mean, I'm learning everything new about corn myself. Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host, Association CEO Jon Doggett. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC beltway, we're making sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: The Field of Dreams is an iconic movie for baseball fans and corn growers alike. That image of an idyllic baseball diamond set amongst the Iowa corn stalks has endured now for decades. This summer, the NCGA had the opportunity to be a part of Major League Baseball's plan to bring baseball back to that field in Dyersville.

Dusty Weis: With that, it's time to once again introduce Jon, Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. Jon, the NCGA had a chance to be a part of something truly special recently. On Thursday, August 12th in Dyersville, Iowa, the Chicago White Sox played the New York Yankees in the middle of a beautiful field of nine-foot-tall corn next to the historic Field of Dreams movie site. Jon Doggett: You know, Dusty, we've done and seen some really cool things at NCGA, but I don't know anything that compares to the spectacle that unfolded that night in that very, very special field of corn. In this episode of Wherever Jon May Roam, we're going to relive that experience with two of the very few that got to watch it live from the stands in Dyersville. First is NCGA President John Linder, who watched it all go down from a few rows right behind home plate. Welcome, John. John Linder: Really glad to be here. Boy, what an awesome experience, Jon. Jon Doggett: Absolutely. Our very special guest today is former White Sox outfielder Ron Kittle, who was there with his former team. Ron was the American League Rookie of the Year in 1983 with the White Sox, who played in that league through 1991. Ron, thank you so much for being with us. Ron Kittle: I appreciate the opportunity to talk about a little bit of a fantasy and a little bit of heaven out there in Dyersville. Jon Doggett: That's right. It's not heaven, it's Iowa. Ron, you're the first major league ballplayer we've had on this program. I've got to ask that question every kid asks. What's it like playing professional baseball? Ron Kittle: I've had to answer it a million times, and it never changes. It's an opportunity to go out there and compete at the highest level, compete with camaraderie, with friends that you get to know all through the minor league days. The minor league days is where you start, Jon, is you make no money. I was making $500 or $600 a month trying to make an apartment, a car payment. In 1982 when I got to the big leagues, I made $32,000. It was really funny. Four years prior to that, at graduation of high school, I was an ironworker and I made $72,000. I took a cut in pay to get to the big leagues, but it's a dream. Ron Kittle: You watch TV, an action movie, you want to ride a race car. You see a motocross, you want to ride a motorcycle. It's just that. I grew up playing baseball. When the street lights went on, I went home and I was done for the day. It just became a passion, to go out there to compete, play catch, and have a catch with your dad or whatever it is. Maybe a little play on the movie words, but it was a great opportunity. Jon Doggett: What were a few of your proudest moments as a ballplayer? Ron Kittle: I think having my family be able to watch me. My role as a baseball player came up a little differently. I had basketball scholarships, football scholarships, none for baseball. I hit extremely well for baseball. When you play in the Midwest, Gary, Indiana, you don't play a lot of games, but I also wore glasses. The old-time scouts just turned away from anybody who had glasses. They said, \"You'll never make it to the big leagues.\" Well, one day I just went to a tryout camp for the Los Angeles Dodgers and I did very well, and they signed me to a contract. Ron Kittle: I was almost getting ready to go to college. I said, \"You know what? I've got to show this scout that I can play in the major leagues.\" That became my mission, to go out there to play with glasses. If you a baseball fan of any sort, there's not many players who ever played with glasses. I could not wear contacts, so that means even less people wore glasses, probably I would say maybe 10 in the whole major leagues, but I had to prove somebody wrong. You know, I got my chance to play, and I think I did all right with it. Jon Doggett: You know, Ron, talking to somebody like you who came into the league from a non-traditional background, you talk about how you worked as an ironworker prior to getting into the world of baseball. How do you think that changed your approach to the game and your approach to training, and your desire to play the game? Ron Kittle: I had a tough dad. I mean, literally. If I would have died, he probably would have yelled at me and said, \"Get up and walk it off,\" or something like that. When I tried out for the Los Angeles Dodgers, I started in 1977. I go to Vero Beach and I had a great spring training. I go down to Clinton, Iowa. There's another corn belt for you right there. My first at bat, I hit a double. Mike Scioscia hits a single, I score, and a catcher catches a ball improperly and jams me, and breaks my neck and paralyzes me at home plate. That's my first game, first at bat in all professional baseball. Ron Kittle: It took me three or four months before I started having any movement at all. I played a little bit that year and I did all right, but at the end of the season, my ears were killing me. My teeth were bleeding. I mean everything hurt on me but my neck. I get checked out, and the guy goes, \"You've got three crushed vertebrae and a cracked spinal cord. Are you stupid?\" I said, \"Obviously I was.\" When you're 18, you just want to play sports or get a chance. Ron Kittle: I had the screws in the halo in my head, and I was done. Doctor told me, \"You'll never play again.\" Inside of me I was angry, but I wanted to go prove this guy wrong again for wearing glasses. I just worked out to be the best shape I possibly could. If I told you the whole story ... I don't know how long the show's going to be if you want to hear the story, because you can't make this up. I mean honestly, a scriptwriter couldn't make it up. Ron Kittle: I go back ironworking. I weighed 185 after I healed up a little bit, and I played for a semi-pro team, one game, one at bat. I drive over, and I'm as strong as you possibly can get. Long hair, beard, suntan, muscles from ironworking. The first pitch the guy threw me at this semi-pro league was right at my head, and I haven't swung a bat in over a year. I kind of whipped my head back, almost like a cartoon character when your head falls off. The next pitch he threw me, I was in Midlothian, Illinois, and I hit a ball over the light tower, over the fence, on the highway. It's never been done before. Ron Kittle: Fortunately, the guys driving down the street, it hit in front of their car. The two people were Bill Veeck and Billy Pierce from the Chicago White Sox, the owner. They went to the next exit and they said, \"Who hit the ball on the highway?\" I'm hiding, thinking I broke the windshield. They gave me another opportunity. It was on a Tuesday. Friday I tried out for the White Sox out of a second trial camp, and I got a chance to prove I was pretty good. That's how it happens. I mean, that's a story in itself. Jon Doggett: Not only did the stars align, the planets aligned on that one. Ron Kittle: One hundredth of a second in any direction, this story doesn't happen. It really doesn't. Bill Veeck owned the Chicago White Sox at the time. He's also the first one that planted the ivy at Wrigley Field. There's a little piece of trivia for you. Billy Pierce was a White Sox pitching great of the '50s and the '60s. Like I said, something was lined up, somebody was looking after me, and I got a chance to play in the major leagues for 10 years. It was pretty good. Jon Doggett: In other words, Ron, if you want to do something, you get somebody to tell you that you can't do it. Ron Kittle: Really, you know, my whole life has been like that. I like that challenge. I tell my kids I will never let anybody outwork me. I'd rather die of a heart attack than let somebody outwork me. I've got to prove people wrong, that I can do it. I'm 63 years old. I work out. I can't say I work out fitness-wise, but I work at my property every single day. I mean, I hauled two and a half ton of boulders the other day, like mushball-sized ones, cantaloupe, into the back. I dug them out of the ditch. I did it all by hand, on the hottest day of the year. I just like working. I don't consider it work. I consider it a workout. I just have fun with it. Dusty Weis: You know, John Linder, president of the National Corn Growers Association, I listen to a story like Ron's and I think to myself, \"Boy, that work ethic sounds like just about every grower that I've ever met in my life.\" You've spent a career working the fields out in Ohio there, John. Hearing a story like that, does that resonate with you? John Linder: Oh, it really does. I can't say that I go move rocks around the properties so much anymore, because I grew up as a kid picking rocks out of fields. Half the fun of that was the dirt clod fights I had with my brother, if you can imagine, stone too. We got pretty good at pitching those. I never did play baseball, but boy, it's so enjoyable to watch really good talent play a great game like it happened at Field of Dreams. You know, you're right. Many times folks say you can't do that. We get entrenched in the knowledge that we've had as a history, and think we just need to continue doing things we always did. You don't get anywhere, do you, Ron? You need to think for yourself, and you really need to try new things and really go for it. I can so relate to the stories he's telling of his history. It's amazing. Ron Kittle: Well, you're lucky I'm not a neighbor of yours at a farm, because that's how I got all these doggone rocks. They would till up the field. I would literally take my wheelbarrow out there and fill it up probably 30, 40 times in the back of my property. I'm building a fire pit with them, and the farmer comes over and he gives me a bottle of Jack Daniels, and I never even met the guy. He goes, \"I've dented up many a blade on those things over there, tilling those fields up.\" John Linder: Well, Ron, I'll do a little better. I'll get you a side-by-side with a tilt bed. You just come on out. Ron Kittle: Like I said, it's exercise for me, but I've got a great appreciation for farmers. My uncle was a farmer in Minnesota. He had corn every year. I got my little taste of what corn was. Like right now, these county fairs. When I'm riding my motorcycle, I'll pull into a town that has a fair, and they've got hot buttered corn. They dip it in there. Grease is dripping all over your face. I salt it up like crazy. Yeah, I could probably go for about four or five ears of that right now. John Linder: We'd all have to wash our beards. I think there's four of us that would have a little issue of a napkin won't quite cut it with that sweet corn. Dusty Weis: Yeah. Hot soap and water. That's the only way to go. Ron Kittle, you talk about working on your property and riding your motorcycle. Since your retirement from baseball, I understand you've kept busy with a lot of cool hobbies and side hustles, including I understand you do a lot of woodworking and a little bit of metalworking. How'd you get into that? What do you love about it? Ron Kittle: Well, my graduation present was a piece of paper that said, \"You're an apprentice ironworker for American Bridge.\" Everybody else had a party thrown for them, a car. I went to work the next morning at 4:30 in the morning with my dad. That's where I made all my money, but he taught me a great work ethic. I went to work, because he was getting older and he was not healthy. I went out there. I worked twice as hard as everybody else out there to protect my dad, and he knew it. Ron Kittle: I dabbled a lot. I learned how to weld. When I travel around the country and I speak for Fortune 500 companies, I say there's five things I can't do, sing, dance, give birth, do my taxes, and fifth-grade math. They changed everything now, but there's nothing I can't make, physically. I know nothing about automobiles and cars or nothing like that, I'll take that to my buddies who are mechanics, but if I see something, I can make it, and I can make it better. Ron Kittle: This table that I'm on right now, the legs are three-inch I-beams, which is an ironworker underneath it. The top is two-and-a-quarter-inch. It's 80 x 80 ash, which are bats, and the tabletop weighs 548 pounds. I just like nice things. I like them built well, and I've always been like that. I always tell everybody it's that CDO. It's like OCD but in the right order. CDO, you get it? It's my ADHD all in one. I sleep three hours a night. I constantly work. I just love it. I mean, if I had nothing to do, I go crazy. John Linder: Ron, it sounds like there's a lot of comparison between the industries you cut your teeth on and farming. Hard work is so much part of what you did. I've got to tell you, when I drive up to Chicago, I drive right by that plant. I marvel at the engineering that goes into that bridgework. It's pretty phenomenal, as a farmer. I really like to look at things that are manufactured like yours. You're going to have to show me your table sometime. Ron Kittle: It's not bragging. I just keep busy because I've been restless my whole life like that. I mean, my parents used to say I'd walk into the house when the streetlights would go on. I would just walk in from playing all day or doing something. I would just do a Nestea plunge, on my face. My older brother would drag my feet into the room, and I'd have a little scab on my nose from him dragging me. I was just unconscious, but it's just like that. Ron Kittle: You know, you're bringing back. We drove out to Dyersville from Chicago, a three-and-a-half-hour drive from my house. You're seeing what's going to be a spectacular event. What's really cool, John, is MLB didn't let anybody go inside and see it before, the facilities. No cameras were allowed, nothing until the day of the game. I've got a little backstory on that. I was part of the original group that went in to purchase this. Ron Kittle: I drove for, I think, five months straight, two times a week. I had to go in there and present our case to prove why we deserved to build a field in there from the Lansing family. We met with the drainage board, the town commissioner. I was in there, and my attorneys go, \"Here's things that you can't say.\" I said, \"Well, you just got the wrong guy to come do your work for you,\" and I opened it up right there. Ron Kittle: One of the neighbors who is still on the site is still fighting to not have the fields there. If you were there, you've seen the big house up there with all the barns. They bought the property because of the movie site. That's the only reason they bought it. They had never even heard of Dyersville before. That was my first thing. I said, \"Listen here.\" I said, \"I bet you my entire life and my dog ... and I'll never risk my dog ... that you bought your property because you wanted to be associated with the movie site.\" Ron Kittle: We wound up getting it from the Lansing family. It was 173 acres out there. I've been there. I played catch on that little movie site. I took motorcycle groups out there. I did batting practice one day for five hours. Jon, it could be either one of you, or Dusty could have been out there with your dad and your grandkids. I threw batting practice the entire day for five hours straight, to every person who went up there, because no matter how bad you are, I can hit your bat. It's not to hit a home run. It's just the ambiance of what's going on out there. I think it's a spectacular place. Hopefully you all saw the movie, right? Jon Doggett: Oh, of course, absolutely. John Linder: Absolutely. Ron Kittle: I mean, it still gives me chills, and I've seen it probably 20 times. When the players came out of the outfield ... John, you can relate to this. It gave me the chills. It was like movie theatrical. It was just perfect. Like Kevin Costner said, it was perfect. John Linder: As did I. I got those same chills, and I think 8,000 other folks. It was great to be there to experience that with 8,000 of your closest friends. I say that truthfully, because everybody wanted that experience, and, oh, what an experience. Ron Kittle: Everybody I have talked to about that game, whether they saw it in person or saw it on TV, they all talk about that moment when the players came out from the corn, just how it was an awe-inspiring moment. It was truly, I think of all of the moments of that game, there were a lot of really great moments. For me that was the coolest part of the whole thing, was to see that. Like I say, after you've watched the movie a dozen times, that was a pretty neat moment. It was better seeing it on TV, because it was 105-degree humidity out there. All the women who had eyeliner on, it looked like they had war paint because it was dripping down their faces. I'll tell you what, either way, it was pretty spectacular. Dusty Weis: Jon Doggett, as the NCGA CEO, Ron had talked about the formation and the early planning phases of getting this thing off the ground. You were in the room when the corn growers decided to get involved with this project as well. Can you give us a little bit more of a background about how the NCGA got involved with the MLB Field of Dreams game? Jon Doggett: Absolutely. You know, Neil Caskey, our vice-president of communications, called me one day and said, \"Let me ask you, have you ever seen the movie Field of Dreams?\" I said, \"Yeah, who hasn't seen the movie Field of Dreams?\" He said, \"Well, guess what. They're going to do it again. We have an opportunity to be involved in that. What do you think?\" I said, \"You don't need to ask me what I think. We're going to do this.\" We took it to our officers and then we took it to our board, and then we took it to our states. Jon Doggett: Boy, there's few things other than a $2 bump in corn that got people as excited as this. It was just a no-brainer. It was how do we get it done? What's it going to cost and how are we going to move forward? Then of course, the pandemic hit and the game gets put off for a year. All through that year, everybody said, \"It's going to happen. It's going to happen. It's going to happen.\" Like I said, I've not seen anything that got folks as excited in our organization as this baseball game. Dusty Weis: You know, Ron, you are, in your current role, essentially a team ambassador for the Chicago White Sox. That gives you the opportunity to of course be a spokesperson for the organization, but also to get to know a lot of the players that are in the locker room right now. What was the reaction among a lot of these guys who are 24, 25, 26 years old, maybe weren't even alive when the Field of Dreams movie came out? Ron Kittle: This past year, I'm not allowed to go in the locker room at all. Not even in what we call the surrounding area, the concourse. You can't even go down there, because it's all MLB Tier 1 approved. I heard through the grapevine, a lot of the people never saw the movie. They're into different things nowadays, social media. They all saw the movie finally, and every one of them was super pumped to be there. I could pretty much say, out of the 30-some-odd teams in Major League Baseball, every single person but maybe 10 would have been extremely proud to be in the first game out there. I explained to Jerry Reinsdorf, Yankees-White Sox, the way they did it, was perfect. It was a big-top circus. Ron Kittle: I think the following year, supposedly with the Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds coming in there ... no offense to the Reds there, John, from Ohio ... but it's going to be a little bit of a upscale carnival, because the movie is not about the Reds or the Cubs or anything like that. The Cubs are nationally known for all this media throughout the world. I mean, I've been in Japan and the Cubs were on TV. I've been to Australia and the Cubs are on TV. I mean, they're just worldwide known out there, but the effect of it. I mean, these players went in early, because I was out there early also, and I still had to spend $475 for my seat. Now, did you get a free seat? I don't know. Did you? John Linder: I'd really like to not discuss what that seat cost. Dusty Weis: It was not a free seat. Ron Kittle: Okay. Now, my son, he's out in California. He goes, \"Dad, I've got some clients.\" He's a golf teacher. He goes, \"They'll give you 3,000 a seat.\" I bought four seats. I go, \"If they get it to 5,000, they can come out there and I'll buy them the first batch of corn,\" but I didn't sell my seat. My wife wanted to go see it, and she was just overwhelmed with the whole thing. Jon Doggett: I want you to know that the morning of the game at Reagan National Airport, Washington, D.C., early that morning there was a man who heard that his flight to Iowa was canceled, and it was a sad and tragic moment as he lay on the floor sobbing uncontrollably, but we forgive you. I'll tell you what, I'm not going to forgive American Airlines for canceling not one but two flights on me that day. Anyway, I hope you all enjoyed the game in person, but Dusty and I watched it on television. Dusty Weis: I started my travels to get there that day at 4:00 in the morning in Nashville, Tennessee. I'm getting texts from Jon Doggett, \"This is a problem.\" I'm thinking, \"Oh, I hope it doesn't transfer. You own that problem. I'll just keep traveling.\" Fortunately I made it there in good shape, and I really felt bad for Jon, but such an opportunity. That was the opportunity. You got to meet the groundskeeper, and here's a story about the wind really coming in and wreaking havoc on the site and sticking up 1,000 corn plants. Now to hear you, Ron, share about the background work in procuring the site for this. Dusty Weis: You know, 90 million acres corn raised in the U.S. This is a perfect field for this game. Thank you for securing that site so this could take place. It's so meaningful to every corn farmer in the nation. They really, really appreciate the fact that we could do a cornfield ballgame again that was as meaningful as a movie set. We all have our favorite moments of the movie, but we all now have really favorite moments, whether you watched on TV or in person, of that game. You know, you talk about your life being choreographed. How can you choreograph a game like that, Ron? Tell us a little bit about what you saw and you felt. Ron Kittle: I was more impressed finding out that they hired this guy and paid him a lot of money to make sure they put sticks on those corns when the winds knock them down. I guarantee it. They're out there waxing the leaves. I mean, it was absolutely perfect. They cut the corn maze out. Remember that, the corn maze? Did you walk in it? I don't know if you did or not. Jon Doggett: Yes. That was the National Corn Growers corn maze, yes. Ron Kittle: I'm going to tell you one thing, I couldn't get out of the doggone thing, and it was so hot. Sweat was dripping down my face like it was crazy. I bought the authentic White Sox jersey, and I have them over here to my right. I bought four with my number 42 on it. I played with number 42. It's retired in every ballpark in the country due to Jackie Robinson's respect. It came in a size 38, and I wear a 50. It literally looked like I was some overweight man. I called the company who made these, and she goes, \"Oh, my gosh.\" I sent one back and she goes, \"Yeah, it was mismarked.\" I will auction these off, but I bought the corn grower. It was an Iowa State logo with corn growing on it. I'm going to auction off these four jerseys here with the patch sewed onto it. If they want an autograph, I'll sign it. If not, but I think they cost me like $320 a jersey for the authentic ones, the same ones that the players wear. Ron Kittle: I couldn't get out of that corn maze. I was getting frustrated. I was dying of thirst, because you know there's humidity inside the corn mazes. I'm not too big, but I walked right through the doggone thing sideways, just to go. I started heading to the light. I was a hunter hunting a bear. I was going through the wickets, and I got out. One of the kids that was working there as security, one of my real good friends' son who got asked to be a security guard there, he was screaming my name and taking pictures. That made it almost more fun, because I got to know him. Jon Doggett: Ron, I will neither confirm nor deny. I may have stepped in and said, \"I'm not going to do this today,\" and stepped back out. Ron Kittle: Yeah, that was a wise choice. Now, I just thought it took postponing the game to make this event even better. I think if they would've did it last year at this time, it wouldn't have been as climactic. It wouldn't have been as good because the White Sox team stunk last year, but they're playing pretty good baseball. The Yankees, they were in a hot streak out there. Ron Kittle: I usually leave early when I work the ballparks, just to beat traffic out of Chicago. I left early before Timmy Anderson hit the home run, but I was in center field. I don't need to be in a seat, watching it from home plate. I was closer to the home run than the people in the stands. The people that I was guests with, other White Sox, it took them three and a half hours to get home after the game. It took me 45 minutes to get back to Galena, so I could stay in my hotel and have a cigar. Dusty Weis: Let's talk about that for a second, Ron, because you could not have scripted a better baseball game. Fellows were just bombing it over the wall into the corn all day. The Sox stake out an early lead, but then the Yankees rally to go up 8-7 in the top of the ninth, only to have it snatched away by Tim Anderson in the bottom of the ninth. You've been around the league. You've played for 10 years. You've been to a lot of baseball games. Where does that moment, the stalk-off home run, they call it, where does that fall in your all-time pantheon of great baseball moments. Top 50, top 20, top 10? Where are we at? Ron Kittle: I'm saying it's probably in the top 20, and it's probably worldwide more famous now due to social media. Because when I played in the '80s, there was only one or two sports programs. This Week in Baseball, you would catch it. Now you've got Instagram, you've got Twitter, you've got TikTok, you name it. I'm still trying to figure out when Timmy Anderson was doing this. I still haven't figured out what he did, when he was running around the bases like ... I don't know. Flipping boogers off his fingers or something? I couldn't tell you. I think he said, \"It's finished.\" You know, he was trying to say it's done. I might guess, but Timmy's a good kid. He's a real good player. When he signed to the White Sox, his parents walked up to me ... and they're White Sox fans ... and he goes, \"Mr. Kittle, you've got my permission to pound my son Timmy in the head if he does something stupid.\" Well, when you're six-four, 250 pounds, you can beat a lot of people up out there. Ron Kittle: My wife recorded every single interview streaming from all the networks, the game officially, but what made it so spectacular is the announcers didn't get sidetracked, talk about other stupid stuff. They stayed focused on the movie scenes, on the property site, on the people in attendance. The White Sox got 1,600 tickets and the Yankees got 1,600 tickets. That was the deal. We had to buy them. I'd buy them from the White Sox. The other ones went into a lottery where other people got it or influential people, a local guy who's a CEO of a company. White Sox auctioned off four of them for charity, four seats, four jerseys and the hotel room in Galena. He spent 60 grand on it. Jon Doggett: What's the line from the movie, the Field of Dreams movie, when the older fellow is sitting there and he's talking about how it's money they have, it's peace that they lack? \"They'll pay anything to come to the field of dreams.\" I think that's what you see right there. Ron Kittle: Yeah, James Earl Jones. I mean, if nobody knew what the Corn Growers Association is all about, they do now, due to that game out there. It was absolutely perfect. I mean, I'm learning everything new about corn myself. I was told, because my brother-in-law worked for DeKalb Corn. Is it true that one silk goes to every kernel? That's what I heard. Jon Doggett: A hundred percent right. Ron Kittle: There's only typically one corn ear on every stalk. I took a picture the other day of some with two, and one had three and one was a little tiny one. That might've been the hybrid. I've never seen that. John Linder: I want to draw a visual for you. You said you left early, as you many times do, he got the home run before you left the field. It was amazing. I never thought anybody left when the White Sox players were out on the field, bringing her family out, taking photos and videos of the feeling they had, capturing that cornfield in the background for the ballpark. It was just a lot of fun to just watch those folks get to appreciate the opportunity to win such monumental game. For me, to frame it with corn was just over the top. Just a wonderful experience. I'll thank you again for your part in that. Jon Doggett: Absolutely. You know, we talked about the price of the tickets. It was pretty cheap compared to the value that we got out of that game, to have the announcers talk to one another about, \"You know, that corn, that's not sweet corn out there. Most of the corn grown in the United States is field corn.\" Jon Linder and I can say that all day long and nobody will listen. Joe Buck says it, it's a whole different story. Those are the kinds of things, that we have to meet people where they're at. We can't expect them to meet us where we're at. This game just gave us that ability to do that. That was just so, so neat. Jon Doggett: I've got to tell you, I have friends and family who have nothing to do with the corn industry who have called me, who have texted me, who have emailed me and said, \"That game was wonderful. Oh, by the way, I didn't know that this was field corn,\" or I didn't know this or I didn't know that. What great opportunities we've had with this program. It just boggles my mind. Dusty Weis: Jon Linder, I wanted to ask you too about the educational impact of the thing. As a grower yourself, what did it mean to you to see the message of the Corn Growers being broadcast out to a national audience like that during this game? John Linder: You know, Dusty, one of the reminders as you get caught up in the game, I tweeted out that I took an excellent photo of someone hitting one of the home runs. To be able to say in that tweet that words cannot describe the feeling I feel when the home run hits the cornfield. In the seventh inning, they were carrying out the National Corn Growers banner and putting it behind home plate. To know that that's going to be on national TV was just a reminder that this was such an opportunity to engage folks at a level they haven't had an opportunity to engage with us. John Linder: The MLB folks after the game, I mentioned sitting in the stands and nobody's really leaving. We finally said, \"You know, they do have a place where we can go to connect with some of the folks from MLB,\" so we left and did that. The questions about corn, so basic. We overthink it, right? \"How'd you get the rows so straight?\" \"Oh, they're planted with a planter, drawn straight through the field. Every 30 inches, we're dropping seed. You know, that spacing, we spend a great deal of money to make sure that spacing is equal between those plants, so they are very prolific and emerge together, so that the ear height is the same, so the production from every plant is the same.\" John Linder: For them to think about that being photosynthesis. That is solar energy. We're taking the sun and producing a protein to produce feed value. You know, the aha interface. We overthink the story. They don't need to know the nitty-gritty details. They want to know how much care we give into what we do, and they can see it. It wouldn't be that way if we didn't put that kind of care into it. John Linder: What a great experience, and it makes one think about how you do tell corn's story. I've always been a person that said you've got to understand your audience whenever you message. We missed a few times, but I think this was an eye-opener to an opportunity to engage a broader audience at a level for which they can appreciate. Dusty Weis: You know, Jon Linder, you mentioned one of the what I would assume was a goosebumps moment for you, seeing the NCGA logo unfurled on the banner out there on the field. We didn't yet touch on the other goosebumps moment that you had. You actually got some face time with the one, the only Kevin Costner, out on the field, star of the Field of Dreams himself. Tell us about that. How did that happen? John Linder: Well, that's a story a lot like Ron's. We can cut it off at any point you want to, but we stopped in Dyersville ... which if I go back next year, which I plan on it, I need to stop and see Ron in Dyersville ... but we stopped to visit with folks there. Someone said, \"There's a really big line out there already.\" We're thinking, \"Oh, my goodness, we've got 3:30 batting practice that a couple of us get to attend.\" We're sitting out on the road, not moving at 3:00, and thinking there's no way. John Linder: Well, they dump us off, and we don't know where we're going. We head in from the parking lot, across the bridge into the movie set, the field of dreams, right? Where do you go? It's all corn. How do you get to that stadium over there? They said, \"Well, just walk in the corn.\" I've been in a cornfield. Just choosing randomly a path is not always going to get you where you want to go. We figured it out. It was such a great experience. John Linder: We're hoofin' it, and we're asking anybody that might know, because we actually don't have passes. We're just on the list. I showed them a picture of the gate we need to be. \"Oh, yes.\" We're sweating by then, Ron. I mean, it's the shirt, and it's wet. We're getting around to the far side of the stadium to find someone that we don't even know who they are, so we can get in for branding practice. Well, we made it. John Linder: Chris Edgington and I, first vice president, president, we get out there and we're standing at the corner, that little chained-off area for us to watch batting practice. Who comes by us on the left, straight up behind us? Kevin Costner, and we're thinking, \"Well, we've got to see if we can engage him.\" He is actually a very generous individual. He is standing there with his arms crossed, and he's really not watching batting practice. He's taking in the set, because he's got a performance to give. He's got his arms crossed and just taking the day. Then I'm thinking, \"How do you do this without being rude?\" John Linder: A couple Mr. Costner questions, you know? The first one, the guy next to him just turned at me and smiled like, \"You're not going to get there. You might as well quit now.\" We asked him the question, \"How's it feel to be back in Iowa?\" Oh, he turned and he said, \"Somehow it feels like I never left.\" A couple other real short engagements like that. John Linder: Then he turns and he says, \"I suppose you gentlemen would like a photo.\" Well, I didn't say it, but you know what came to mind. \"Ya think?\" Yes, of course I do. My wife would shoot me if I didn't get that opportunity. She really loves that photo, because it's Chris and I and Kevin Costner. I hand the phone to a friend who actually had passes too, and he takes a picture. Mr. Costner is walking away, and he said, \"It didn't take. I didn't get it.\" That's the first time I called him Kevin, and I said, \"Kevin, would you mind coming back? We didn't get the photo.\" That was the second photo. You'll probably see the panic of my eyes, but he was just as generous and personable in the photo the second times as he was the first. John Linder: Yes, that's my wife's favorite photo. She likes to take her thumbs on the screen and zoom in, and pretty soon I'm not in the photo and it looks really great. She could kill me for saying that, but she's very generous. She gets the humor in it as well. I've also tried to share it with folks, say, \"What would you pay me for the photo so you can get your face Photoshopped in there?\" You know, there's some people saying, \"That's a calculated thing. I could buy that. I could use that.\" What a great experience, to engage with someone that the work he did in his movie allowed us as corn farmers in the U.S. to connect with consumers. Couldn't say thank you enough to Kevin Costner. Ron Kittle: One quick thing. I got yelled at during the game, because I know when it's going to be quiet in between switching innings. He's sitting down there with his son, and I started to go. I yelled. I said, \"When is season four of Yellowstone?\" He looked around with his sunglasses on with no expression. My wife took a picture of him, and no answer. Then all the drunks behind me started yelling, \"Season four, season four.\" John Linder: I think I might've heard that moment. Ron Kittle: Yeah. I got to meet him earlier, with Bull Durham and all that stuff years ago. Having him there made the event even more special. The corn was absolutely perfect. You know, the little path to get out to the other fields is phenomenal. I mean, you can't even ... it's a Hollywood scriptwriting, what they did. Like I said, I'll be there next year doing something, because I like just doing something. You'll probably see me out there, but bring fans, I'm telling you, because it was hot. It was a hot one out there. John Linder: No doubt about it. Jon Doggett: Well, this time, I am going to go at least one or two, maybe three days early, so that I don't have to deal with the airlines and bet as to whether or not the flight's going to get canceled. This has been a very special podcast, and I thank both of my guests, Jon Linder, a corn farmer from Ohio, and he is the NCGA president, and our very special guest, former White Sox outfielder Ron Kittle.

    "title": "Updated Study Shows the Value of Red Meat Exports to U.S. Corn Farmers",
    "content": "A recent study by the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) indicates that U.S. beef and pork exports added 41 cents per bushel to the value of corn in 2020. That’s 11.5% of the average annual price of $3.52/bushel, and the overall value of red meat exports was $5.8 billion. “Considering everything that happened in 2020, it is encouraging to see how red meat exports continued to show a strong return for U.S. corn farmers,” said NCGA Market Development Action Team (MDAT) Chair and Iowa farmer Bob Hemesath. “The animal ag industry is our largest customer. It’s important to continue to partner with USMEF and expand and grow these markets.” Key findings from the study, which utilizes 2020 export data, include: Beef and pork exports used 530.5 million bushels of corn. At an average annual price of $3.52/bushel, beef and pork exports accounted for $1.87 billion in market value to the corn industry. Beef and pork exports also used 3.03 million tons of distiller’s dried grains with solubles (DDGS) at an annual average price of $154.59/ton, generating $468 million in market value for ethanol mills’ co-products. “The corn industry provides critical support for USMEF's eff­orts to expand global demand for U.S. red meat,” said USMEF Senior Vice President of Industry Relations John Hinners. “This study helps quantify the return on that investment.” You can view the national and state data here.",

    "title": "Corn Growers React to Proposed Tax Changes",
    "content": "The House Ways and Means Committee today released its draft bill, which includes tax provisions that would pay for portions of the proposed $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation legislative package. While the bill would preserve stepped-up basis, there are several provisions impacting family farms, including lowering the current estate tax exemption. Stepped-up basis and the estate tax in the current tax code help protect family farms that are passed down from generation to generation. In response to these developments, NCGA President John Linder released the following statement: “We are very pleased to see that the House Committee did not include the elimination of stepped-up basis within its initial text. However, we are concerned with the provisions on the estate tax in the Committee draft that could impact family farms. NCGA will continue to work to preserve stepped-up basis and the current estate tax exemption as this process moves forward. “Family farms produce crops that feed Americans and provide consumers with affordable and environmentally friendly fuel. We are grateful to the House Agriculture Committee for including funding for biofuels infrastructure in its bill and thank Representatives Cindy Axne, Angie Craig and Cheri Bustos, along with Chairman Scott, for their leadership. Greater market access for higher blends of ethanol deploys more low-carbon fuels while supporting rural economies. As the country works to meet the President’s ambitious climate goals, ethanol is the solution we need now.”",

    "title": "Corn Growers, Farm Organizations, and Small Businesses Tell Congress Tax Proposals Would Hurt the Economy",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association continued this week to fight to protect tax priorities for farmers ahead of the release of Congress’ $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package. As part of these efforts, NCGA joined hundreds of state and federal agricultural organizations in sending three coalition letters urging Congress to preserve important tax provisions. Letters that were sent to Congress this week with corn growers support: NCGA and state corn growers were part of a letter with 327 national, regional and state trade associations highlighting agricultural tax priorities including stepped-up basis, like-kind exchanges, the Sec. 199A small business deduction and current estate tax provisions. NCGA and state corn grower associations were part of over 160 signatories in the Family Business Estate Tax Coalition letter, focusing on the importance of preserving stepped-up basis and potential issues that could come with setting exemptions on inherited property. NCGA joined 39 other organizations in a letter supporting the current law for like-kind exchanges of real estate under section 1031. Farmers, ranchers and forest owners use like-kind exchanges to combine acreage, acquire higher-grade land, mitigate environmental impacts and otherwise improve the quality of their operations. These letters build on previous coalition efforts and come on the heels of an aggressive campaign by NCGA to deliver the message to Members of Congress to preserve stepped-up basis. Corn growers have responded to a national call-to-action resulting in over 6,000 messages being sent to over 160 offices in the U.S. House of Representatives and 86 offices in the U.S. Senate. NCGA also conducted a coordinated phone campaign that strategically reached various key congressional Member offices. The overwhelming response from growers reinforced concerns from our members that the proposals to repeal the stepped-up basis on capital gains taxes would have devastating effects on family farms, small businesses and rural communities across the nation. The House Ways and Means Committee is expected to markup legislation next week, which will include provisions on how it will fund the budget reconciliation package through tax increases.",

    "title": "NCGA, RFA, Growth Energy Statement on RVP Rehearing Petition Denial",
    "content": "Today, Growth Energy, the National Corn Growers Association, and the Renewable Fuels Association released the following statement after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals denied their petition for rehearing regarding the recent American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, et al. vs. EPA decision, in which the court vacated a 2019 regulation allowing year-round sales of a fifteen percent ethanol fuel blend (E15). “Our petition for rehearing was an opportunity for the D.C. Circuit to remedy a decision that runs counter to legal precedent and which, if maintained, threatens our nation’s rural economy and progress on moving toward a clean energy future. “Today’s petition denial is another hurdle to ensuring year-round access to low-carbon E15, however, due to timing, American drivers and retailers will be able to finish out the E15 summer driving season without disruption to their access to cleaner fuel choices at the pump. Moving forward, we continue to push for a permanent remedy long before the start of next year’s summer driving season.” Background: In June 2019, EPA issued its final rule extending the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) volatility waiver to E15, and it also found that E15 is substantially similar to E10 certification fuel, allowing the fuel to be sold year-round in conventional gasoline markets. Oil refiners soon challenged the rulemaking in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in an attempt to undermine the expansion of biofuels in our nation’s fuel supply. On August 21, 2020, Growth Energy, RFA, and NCGA filed a brief as intervenors in the oil industry’s lawsuit. The brief provided strong support for EPA’s position that parity in RVP waiver regulations for E10 and E15 is consistent with the provisions of the Clean Air Act and the congressional intent behind those provisions. The organizations further pointed out that extending the RVP waiver from E10 to E15 is appropriate because the volatility of the fuel decreases as more ethanol is added into gasoline beyond E10. Growth Energy, NCGA, and RFA also participated in oral arguments for the case. On July 2, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the 2019 rule. On August 16, 2021, Growth Energy, the National Corn Growers Association, and the Renewable Fuels Association filed a petition for rehearing, asking the three-judge panel and the full court to rehear the case because the decision conflicted with binding precedent and had exceptionally significant consequences for the biofuels industry and others.",

    "title": "Group Spotlights Biofuel Benefits for Californias Carbon-Neutral Future",
    "content": "In joint comments submitted last week to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), a group of ag and biofuel organizations and companies highlighted the role renewable fuels like ethanol can and should play in helping the state achieve its goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2045 or sooner. CARB is in the process of updating its Scoping Plan, which lays out the path toward achieving the state’s carbon reduction targets. The comments were signed by leadership of the Renewable Fuels Association, Growth Energy, National Corn Growers Association, Aemetis Inc., Alto Ingredients Inc., Calgren Renewable Fuels, Pearson Fuels, Propel, POET and RPMG. Their letter spotlights recent state-funded research that indicates pathways to carbon neutrality through greater reliance on renewable fuels like low-carbon ethanol. “The carbon intensity of the fuel continues to drop as farmers and fuel producers invest in better techniques and technologies,” the group writes. “Ethanol in a wide range of blend levels above today’s typical 10% blend represents an immediate, mid-term and long-term opportunity for California to maximize GHG reductions, while providing affordable fuel to consumers and encouraging new economic development and job growth in the state.” Reminding CARB that ethanol has already cut more than 26 million metric tons of carbon in California with a weighted average carbon intensity 46% lower than gasoline, the group recommended first that the board expedite the approval of E15 as a legal fuel in California. This action alone has the potential for an immediate 50% increase in GHG reductions from ethanol in the existing light duty fleet. Second, the group recommended the state consider requiring internal combustion engine light-duty vehicles sold in California be flex-fuel vehicles beginning in model year 2024. This requirement would put more vehicles on the road capable of maximizing GHG reductions comparable to battery electric vehicles through use of higher biofuel blends, which emit fewer toxic tailpipe emissions. Finally, they urged that the Low Carbon Fuel Standard program be extended beyond 2030 in a form that is consistent with the state’s carbon neutrality goals. Specifically, the program should incorporate crediting for agricultural soil carbon sequestration, given the significant opportunity for GHG reductions with appropriate incentives and accounting.",

    "title": "Biofuel and Ag Leaders Oppose EPA Motion to Remand 2018 SREs without Vacatur",
    "content": "Last night, the Renewable Fuels Association, Growth Energy, National Corn Growers Association, National Biodiesel Board, American Coalition for Ethanol, and National Farmers Union opposed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) motion to remand but not vacate the 31 small refinery exemptions (SREs) the Trump Administration granted in August 2019. The coalition of biofuel and ag leaders is currently challenging the 31 SREs in the D.C. Circuit, arguing that EPA’s issuance of the exemptions was arbitrary and capricious and exceeded the Agency’s authority under the Clean Air Act. Together, these leaders provided the following statement in opposition to this motion: “While it is encouraging that EPA intends to reconsider the 31 SREs granted for the 2018 compliance year, we must oppose EPA’s motion to remand without a deadline and without addressing the SREs’ ongoing damage to the biofuel industry. In addition to seeking a remand of the SREs, the Biden Administration EPA should ask that they be vacated; or at the very least, EPA should ask the court to set a deadline by which the reconsideration of these petitions must be completed. This would allow the Biden Administration EPA to hit the reset button and conduct a new evaluation of each 2018 SRE request in light of the 10th Circuit Court decision in Renewable Fuels Association et al. v. EPA and the recent Supreme Court decision overturning one piece of the 10th Circuit decision. We are looking to the Biden Administration to renew the bond with farmers and rural economies by restoring certainty and integrity to the RFS.” Background: In August 2019, the Trump Administration’s EPA approved an unprecedented 31 SREs for the 2018 RVO compliance year with only a cursory, two-page decision. This coalition of biofuels and ag leaders filed a petition in the D.C. Circuit Court challenging EPA’s decision. The coalition asked the court to stay the 2018 SRE case in November 2019 pending the outcome of related litigation in both the 10th Circuit and D.C. Circuit Courts. In January 2020, the 10th Circuit ruled in Renewable Fuels Association et al. v. EPA et al. that EPA has no power to ‘extend’ an exemption that had lapsed. The Court also held that EPA lacks the authority to grant an exemption based on hardships not caused by RFS compliance, and also found that it was arbitrary and capricious for EPA to ignore its own prior studies showing that refiners recoup RFS compliance costs. On June 25, 2021, in HollyFrontier v. Renewable Fuels Association, the Supreme Court vacated the 10th Circuit’s holding that EPA may only ‘extend’ continuously pre-existing exemptions. EPA nevertheless has had the opportunity to apply the other two 10th Circuit precedents not challenged in the HollyFrontier case and vacate the 31 SREs at issue in the D.C. Circuit. However, on August 25, 2021, EPA instead filed a motion to remand the SREs without vacatur, meaning that, if the motion is granted, the 31 SREs will stay in effect with no deadline or timeline for review or for resumption of the biofuel and ag leaders’ judicial challenge.",

    "content": "The fifth-term Congresswoman from Illinois is the recipient of the NCGA’s President’s Award. The Next Generation Fuels Act is poised to reinforce the market for American ethanol, and it’s been introduced in Congress with bipartisan support. And in this episode of the podcast, we’re joined by Illinois Congresswoman Cheri Bustos, who was honored with the NCGA President’s Award this year for her support as sponsor of the Next Generation Fuels Act. She’ll outline the specifics of the bill, share the outlook from Washington and detail what you can do to make sure this important piece of legislation becomes law. Direct Share Link Transcript Rep. Cheri Bustos: Creating jobs, opening up opportunities for our family farmers, driving down carbon emissions. All of that happens if we can get the Next Generation Fuels Act passed, this is an opportunity that we have, and I would love to be able to get this signed into law and make this part of how we do business going forward. Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis. And I will be introducing your host association, CEO, Jon Doggett. From the fields of Corn Belt to the DC Beltway. We're making sure the growers that feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them. With key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. The Next Generation Fuels Act is poised to reinforce the market for American ethanol. And it's been introduced in Congress with bipartisan support. Dusty Weis: So in this episode, we're joined by Illinois Congresswoman Cheri Bustos, who was honored with the NCGA president's award this year for her support as sponsor of the Next Generation Fuels Act. She'll share the outlook from Washington and what you can do to make sure this important piece of legislation becomes law. But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also, make sure you follow the NCGA on twitter at National Corn and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association news letter at ncga.com. And with that it's time to once again, introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. Jon we're back on the topic of ethanol today, but you brought a little bit of political star power with you this time. Jon Doggett: You know Dusty, it's hard to have a conversation these days about corn without talking about ethanol. And I guess that's been that way for a long, long time, but you know, recently we've had court cases. We've had a new campaign in DC on ethanol that NCGA is driving. You know, the tank, pardon the pun, has been full of ethanol related news of late. And we're very, very fortunate today to be digging into some really good news about ethanol with a very special guest. And we're beyond honored to have Representative Cheri Bustos from Illinois on our program. Jon Doggett: Since 2013, she has represented Illinois 17th congressional district, which encompasses a whole lot of corn country in the Northwestern part of the state. That's only a small part of her story. She's a former journalist. She served her community in a number of different positions at the local level. And she's a member of the Illinois college sports hall of fame, among many, many other things, and we're going to come back to that hall of fame thing later in the podcast. But with that welcome Congresswoman Bustos. And please tell us, what did I miss in that intro? Rep. Cheri Bustos: Intro? Well, first of all, Jon, thank you very much for having me and Dusty, thank you for setting all of this up as well. Let's see. I come from a long line of family farmers, why we start there because of the topic at hand. They all grow corn. Every last one of them, they also raise Angus and we have dairy farmers, we have hog farmers, we have it all in my family. And maybe the other thing worth noting is I have served on the house AG committee since I was first elected, now in my fifth term. So that would be going on 10 years that I've served on the house AG committee. And for the first time I'm actually chairing a subcommittee on general farm commodities and risk management. So again, for the purposes of this conversation, that's pretty important when you're looking at crop insurance, et cetera, and ethanol is extremely, extremely important to the people that I serve. So we want to make sure that we're doing all we can to help. Rep. Cheri Bustos: I always like to say, where the federal government is in your way, I want to know because we should be out of the way if it's getting in the way of your success and where we can be of help, I want to know that as well. So that's my overall general philosophy of being a member of Congress who represents folks who live on close to 10,000 family farms in this congressional district in what's considered downstate Illinois. Jon Doggett: Your district runs from Rockford to East Dubuque along the Mississippi river to the quad cities, curls back around around to include parts of Peoria. You know, sometimes people tend to forget that there's more to Illinois than the city of Chicago. Tell us a little bit about your district. Obviously you have a lot of corn production, but what else is in your district? Rep. Cheri Bustos: Oh, I could talk about this district all day long. Well, first of all, I guess from a political perspective, we have 18 members of Congress in the state of Illinois and every single one of the Democrats is from Chicago land except for the district for me, for the district I represent. So it is typically a district like this that is mostly rural geographically that is represented by our friends on the other side of the aisle. So I remember meeting a Nebraska farmer once and he came up to me and he said, you're a political unicorn. His point was that rural America is not typically represented by Democrats. So I feel very fortunate that the voters here have elected me to five terms in Congress. The other part of our district, I mentioned the nearly 10,000 family farms that are here, but we've also got 90,000 labor households. And that originates mostly because we have the world headquarters of John Deere in the town that I live in. Rep. Cheri Bustos: In fact, I'm sitting right now in my home, which overlooks the Mississippi River. So we also have more locks and dams in this congressional district than any congressional district in the country. So the navigation of the Mississippi, and we also have the Illinois River, the navigation of the Illinois are critically important to our growers, but they're also critically important to commerce throughout the country, but especially in a congressional district like this. So I think that tells a little bit about this congressional district that is driven economically by agriculture. I would say, we are not an affluent district, a family of four makes less than 50,000 a year. Rep. Cheri Bustos: I would just characterize it as hardworking people who politically are more moderate. They just want whoever represents them to get the job done and get results. And that is the way I approach this job. I say that God gave us two ears and one mouth and we should use them proportionately. I'm on what's called the 21st century Heartland tour right now. I do this every August. Yesterday, I was on four farming operations throughout our congressional district. And I listen and then take what I've learned and take that with me out to Washington DC, and hopefully do something about what I've learned and get results for the people back home. Dusty Weis: Well, speaking of listening, you had mentioned that you actually have a pretty busy schedule today, that later today, in fact, you're going to be on the job site now, what do you call that again? And what can you tell us about this? Rep. Cheri Bustos: Well I call it Cheri on shift. We have done this since I was first elected and it really kind of goes back to my days as a journalist. I was a journalist for 17 years. You had mentioned that was part of my background, but if you talk to any journalists the way, at least I think the good ones, operate, they don't sit in the newsroom and just make phone calls all day long, but they like to go out and see things firsthand so they can write about it in a more meaningful way. So I've taken that background and I job shadow people. I do it routinely. In fact, the one that I'm doing today will be my 106th, and I will be in a very hot bakery today. They said to prepare for temperatures to be over 100 degrees. And that's why I explained to you earlier, Jon, I'm very informal. I've got jeans on and a casual shirt and a baseball cap with a state of Illinois on it. Rep. Cheri Bustos: But I have done everything from, I've sat alongside a family farmer and harvested. I have processed carp out of the Mississippi river. I have replaced street bulbs 20, 30 feet up on a cherry picker. I have poured steel into molds. I have been a forger, not a check forger, but where you're forging metal. So literally I have done so many different jobs and here's what I can tell you I've learned from that. Just how hard so many people work to make a living for their families. And I think that's really important for especially members of Congress, who we fly back and forth from our district to spend time in Washington, DC, where people throw around acronyms as if everybody knows what that means and throw out words like reconciliation as if everybody knows what that means. Rep. Cheri Bustos: And the reality is that people are just working hard to support their families, to be proud of the work that they do to put out a good product, to do things like build John Deere combines and the planters, and just really work hard. And that helps me have a great appreciation for just the working man and woman and make sure that I'm doing right by them. So as I said, today will be my 106th. Rep. Cheri Bustos: Then something else I've been doing since I was first elected is we call it Supermarket Saturday. All that means is I go to the grocery store and I will go up to people, anybody I make eye contact with, and that doesn't look like they're in a terrible hurry. And I say, I'm Cheri Bustos. I'll be flying back out to Washington next week. What do you want me to know? And it's amazing what you'll learn from just everyday people when it's not a town hall and nobody's on display or trying to show off, and you just have a one-on-one conversation with people. And those couple of things have really, really helped me never lose sight of the 711,000 people who I represent in this congressional district. Jon Doggett: So you must have had some interesting experiences in both of these things, but just tell me what's the most interesting thing you heard or the most interesting thing you've learned while you were doing the Supermarket Saturdays, you've had to have interacted with a lot of people. What kind of struck you or what was the oh gosh moment or gee, I didn't ever think about it. Rep. Cheri Bustos: You know, a question that I like to ask and I always ask open-ended questions. I don't want just to hear a yes or a no answer. Again, back to my journalism training, that's what you do to get stories. And both my Cherie on Shifts and my Supermarket Saturdays, I like to ask people what they do for fun. The reason I ask that is everybody's got some story about what they do for fun, right? But it gets to people's disposable income and sometimes I'll ask a followup question about, depending on how they answer that question is, have you been able to take a vacation, have you been able to get away with your family at all? And again, that gets to people's disposable income. And I will tell you one of the things that I just can't forget, and it's emblematic of a lot of these conversations I've had, but it was a conversation I had with a home care nurse who said she was married to someone who works for one of the cities and they had two young daughters. Rep. Cheri Bustos: I asked that question about what they like to do for fun. She said, we have cable television. And that struck me immediately that, something that just so many of us take for granted that we have cable, or we maybe in some cases now, I know we have cable cutters, but people who have Netflix or HBO or whatever. And so I said, do you not like to go to the movies? And she said, well, by the time we buy tickets for the four of us and soda and popcorn, we can't afford to do that. So they were left with the exciting part of her life being the fact that they have cable television. And so as soon as she said that to me, my thought is that, gosh, something that so many of us just take for granted that we have cable television and we can watch it for entertainment, but we have other great opportunities. Rep. Cheri Bustos: So I said to her, are you able to take vacations or anything? She said, no, they couldn't do that. And again, what's going through my mind is, this family, who worked hard, home care nurse. Her husband works for the city who worked hard every single day. They have to settle for watching The Disney Channel as opposed to going to a place like Disney World. And so I would say that that summarizes my takeaway from the conversations that I have, again, people who work very, very hard and just how hard it is to get ahead. Things that so many of us take for granted that we could perhaps go to Wisconsin Dells or go down to a St Louis Cardinals game or a Cubs game, but something that so many of us can do. There are also so many who cannot. And I would say those are the people who, when I go out to Washington and I take out my little card to vote yes or no on a piece of legislation, those are the people that I keep in mind and picture and make sure that I'm voting right by them. Jon Doggett: Thank you for telling that story. That's a great story. And it's emblematic of your time in Congress. And one of the reasons that you've been so effective, and one of the reasons we're just delighted to have you here, as people know the national corn growers association honored the Congresswoman with our 2021 president's award, and it's given each year to a leader that's a champion of our issues. And there's an issue right now that we're very much working on. And it's the bill that the Congresswoman recently introduced the Next Generation Fuels Act and introduced with bipartisan support and Congresswoman on behalf of NCGA again and again, thank you for your leadership on ethanol and not surprisingly, this is a big deal for us. So why is ethanol important to you? Rep. Cheri Bustos: It's a big deal to me as well, just to share a little bit more about this district that I've represented now for five terms, not only do we have those nearly 10,000 family farms, but it's worth noting that they grow more than one and a half million acres of corn. And as you know, 40% of our domestic corn product goes toward ethanol production. So on top of that, we have seven biofuel refineries in and around our congressional district. So when I think of ethanol, when I think of the Next Generation Fuels Act, I think of the jobs that are created as a result of that for the seven biofuels plants in our congressional district. I think of these nearly 10,000 family farms and the people who do the work on those farms, who depend on a robust ethanol market to make sure that they can maintain their livelihoods. Again, back to the hard workers. Rep. Cheri Bustos: And I think about increasingly the environmental benefits of using more renewable fuels in our transportation sector. I think about greenhouse gas emissions, that we can improve on that through corn based ethanol, because it burns about 40% less than unblended gasoline. So if you look at all of those benefits, creating jobs, opening up opportunities for our family farmers, driving down carbon emissions, all of that happens if we can get the Next Generation Fuels Act passed. And so this is an opportunity that we have, and I want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to get this passed. And I would love to be able to get the signed into law and make this part of how we do business going forward. Jon Doggett: Explain just a little bit more, what does the Next Generation Fuels Act do and why, you talked about the environmental benefits. Certainly it's a great benefit to corn farmers, but what else does it do that people need to know? Rep. Cheri Bustos: So the Next Generation Fuels Act, it would actually require vehicle makers to use higher octane fuels to certify any new vehicles that are coming off of the manufacturers lot. That they would have to certify them for emission and fuel economy standards. Okay. So what does that mean? So we start out with a 95 research octane number, the RON, I think your listeners all know what RON means and E20 blend for the model year 2026. And then we actually boost that up to 98 RON and E25 or E30 blend by model year 2031. All right. Rep. Cheri Bustos: So on top of that, the bill also requires that fuel retailers carry these higher blend fuels. So they're widely available in the marketplace. That will be absolutely critical. We know that this bill has the potential to usher in new standards of high-octane low carbon liquid fuels. And why that matters is, again, for those reasons that I already mentioned, but by allowing more ethanol to get into the marketplace, we're fortifying an important market for our corn growers. We're shoring up our renewable fuel sector and we're driving down greenhouse gas emissions. So again, this is something that's critically important that we move this through. Jon Doggett: You know, a lot of folks, the legislative process, it's a mystery to most Americans. So take us through the process of what happens next. You introduced the bill, you had some of your colleagues join you on that bill. What's the next step that we need to know? And how do corn farmers help you move that bill through those steps? Rep. Cheri Bustos: Actually writing a piece of legislation is the easy part, because what happens next is you've got to get support. So we have already introduced this bill. And as you mentioned, Jon, it is bipartisan. And so it will get referred next. Since I introduce it in the House, it will go to a house committee and that is decided by the House Parliamentarian. And in the case of the Next Generation Fuels Act, it's been referred to the Energy and Commerce Committee. So now that it's been referred, we need to get the attention of the Energy and Commerce members and the leadership on that committee. With the hope of that, eventually we will hold a hearing on it. And during that hearing, we will invite in witnesses and we'll invite in stakeholder organizations. We'll make sure that the federal government comes in and testifies about the legislation and why it's important. Rep. Cheri Bustos: Then from there we'll work to move to get it included in what's called a legislative vehicle. So there are not a ton of standalone bills that we vote on in the house floor. So if we can find another larger bill and include this as part of it, where let's say you've got some members from more urban areas who don't know that much about ethanol, then we are more likely to get their support. If it's attached to some other legislation that they are supportive of. And as far as what your members can do to help talk to whoever your member of Congress is, talk to your senators, talk about why this is important that we pass this through, and that's really kind of citizen lobbying, citizen government relations. That really can be very, very helpful to get a piece of legislation all the way through. Dusty Weis: Jon, for the National Corn Growers Association, the Next Generation Fuels Act is something that you've been hoping for and working for and putting the shoe leather down to make happen for a real long time now. Why has this been such a priority for NCGA and why should corn farmers care? And maybe even start getting a little bit excited about this? Jon Doggett: Well, they need to get excited about it. We're all about corn grind. And this is a piece of legislation that will grind more corn. And that benefits corn growers, that benefits our environment. It has a lot of benefits, but you know, the most important thing from our standpoint is it's going to grind more corn. And that's our mission is to expand opportunities for corn growers. And this is just one of those really good opportunities for us to do just that. Dusty Weis: When you look at it, Jon, from your position, working for the NCGA and having spent a lot of time in Washington, it's got to be heartening for you to see Representative Bustos, not only championing this issue, but also building bipartisan support for it. Bipartisan, that's not a word that we hear out of Washington a whole lot these days. Jon Doggett: Unfortunately, it isn't a word that we hear much about in Washington. And that's unfortunate. I came to Washington back in the late 80s and Ronald Reagan was president. He famously talked about the loaf of bread. If he could have half a loaf and the other guy got a half a loaf, then they could get a deal and they could come back the next day. Unfortunately, the way Washington works now is not only should you not get half a loaf, you shouldn't get any loaf at all, and we need to burn your bakery down. Jon Doggett: Sorry, Congresswoman, I'm not referring to the one that you're going to be at, but it's not give half to the other guy. I'd rather have nothing than you have anything. And that attitude is really unfortunate. And you know, when people tell me, Washington is divided and I say, well, why is that? Is it because maybe we don't send enough folks like the Congresswoman to Washington that want to work in a bipartisan fashion. So again, Congresswoman, a shout out to you for reaching across the aisle and getting other members of Congress to take a look at this and to agree to help us out in this rather arduous process. Rep. Cheri Bustos: Well, I appreciate that. And back to your point about bipartisanship, there's not enough of it. I actually asked my staff to look back over all of my previous terms to look at the number of bills that we've introduced and how many of those are bipartisan on day one. And literally I have just a handful, just a small number, that on day one of the introduction of our bill that was not supported by a friend across the aisle, and that's important. And to get this all the way through, I mean Democrats are in the majority right now, but we literally have a three vote majority. So you think about that. It's very, very hard to have success. If we think we're going to go it alone and in the end, legislation is better off if you can get support from Republicans and Democrats, and that's what we're going to try to do on this bill. And that's what I've tried to do on 95% plus of the bills that I've introduced from day one. Jon Doggett: You know, you are in a long, long line of members of Congress that I've gotten to know through the years that have frankly disappointed me because you decided to leave and you are going to be leaving at the end of this term. And first of all, let me say again, thank you for all that you have done for the corn industry. And thank you for what you've done for this country. You have been a good moderate voice. You have reached across the aisle. You have been very political at times, which is part of your job, but you also have really puts your constituents first. And we just don't have enough good friends in Washington like you. And we're going to be sad to see it go. So let me ask it this, rather than beating up on Washington, even more, we might get another chance at that. But what stands out to you after 10 years? What are some of your favorite moments while you've been serving in Congress? Rep. Cheri Bustos: Wow. You know, I have so many, I'll do a shout out. You mentioned sports early on in my introduction. I'm just going to mention something very light to kind of lighten this conversation. Since we were talking about bipartisanship and our disappointment that there's not more of it, but here's a good bipartisan story. I play on the congressional women's softball team. There are probably some of your listeners who had no idea that there was a congressional women's softball team, and you might know that there was a congressional men's baseball team, but this is something I've played on since I was first elected. We have practice early in the morning, two to three days a week for months, we typically start in March with our practices and we do all this practicing to play one game. And that says a little bit about our athletic ability, but on our team, here's what's different between the men's game and the women's game on our team. Rep. Cheri Bustos: We have Democrats and Republicans, House members and senators, younger and older. And the one game that we play, it's a charity game. We raise money for young women with breast cancer, but our one game that we play, we play against the women's Washington Press Corps, and we play on an elementary school lot. And we have raised well over a million dollars for this cause just to maybe do a little bit of shout-out for my own gender. The men's team, they can't even come together in sports. They play Democrats against Republicans. And the other thing is they get to play at the nationals major league ballpark while we're playing on this elementary school lot. So just kind of so much symbolism in that, but the reason I bring that up as one of my... Just again, it's light, but I have built some really, really close relationships with friends across the aisle as a result of sports. Rep. Cheri Bustos: For instance, Shelley Moore Capito, the Senator who was trying to work out the infrastructure deal early on. She's a Republican from West Virginia. She's our third baseman. I'm our shortstop, Debbie Wasserman Schultz who ran the Democratic National Committee. She's the second baseman and our first baseman for actually every year until this year, was a woman named Martha Roby out of Alabama. A Republican out of Alabama. Our pitcher is Kiersten Gillibrand, a Democratic Senator from New York and our catcher for many seasons was Joni Ernst, a Republican Senator from Iowa. So that just gives you an idea on the infield of who we have. Rep. Cheri Bustos: And it really is a way that you build relationships when you're showing up to practice early in the morning, you've barely combed your hair. I brush my teeth and put on my sweatpants and head out there and you get to know people in a very different way. I share that with you because I think it's really important that if we can get back to the point where we get to know the members of Congress as human beings, rather just as politicians and somebody of the other party, I think we'd be a lot better off. And that's one way that I've been able to build those relationships and really see a side benefit to being able to get some good legislation through as a result of that. Dusty Weis: You know Representative, I have to ask shortstop, that's a very highly sought after position. And I know that in Congress, there can be a lot of jockeying, a lot of elbowing for position for the prime committee assignments. I'm presuming that the prime infield assignments are a lot the same. Did you have to trot out that you were a member of the Illinois College Sports Hall of Fame to qualify for that position? Or how did that work? Rep. Cheri Bustos: I will say that the reason I have played shortstop every season is I actually know how to throw a ball. And I know how to field. I grew up in a baseball family. My brother played college baseball. He was a pitcher for University of New Orleans and for a Quincy College now called Quincy University and then was actually drafted to play professionally and then coached for 21 seasons in division one baseball. My dad was a college baseball player and then ended up his career working in government relations for Major League Baseball. Rep. Cheri Bustos: So I come from a baseball family and believe me when you come to Congress, we don't have a whole lot of athletes, we don't have a whole lot of former college athletes either. So I have to say the competition wasn't horribly, horribly stiff for that position, but I am moving to first base this season. It will be the first time I haven't been the shortstop and I'm doing that because our former first baseman ended up not running for reelection and I'm tall and my legs are long and my arms are long. Again, I can catch the ball. So I'm going to play first base this season, and I'm looking forward to it. Jon Doggett: Let me ask this, did you get a chance to watch Field of Dreams? Rep. Cheri Bustos: You know what? My sister sent me some clips from it. I couldn't watch the game live, but I love that it's gotten so much buzz and I love that I'm a neighboring state to Iowa. Anything that can help baseball grow more fans. And when you're talking about somebody coming from a cornfield, you know what, that's a win-win, everything's exciting about it. Jon Doggett: That was just a great, great game. So Congresswoman lastly, and I know you've answered this question over and over again, but what's next for Cheri Bustos? Rep. Cheri Bustos: Well, I really haven't answered that over and over again because I'm still working through that myself. I am now down to saying no to some opportunities that are out there and that actually gives me a good feeling because it means I'm narrowing down different options, but I'm working on a plan A, a plan B and a plan C. And I'll let you know what's in those plans when I trim those up a little bit more, but I guess probably the main thing is I want to do something that is meaningful and I'm ready for this next chapter of my life and excited about it. Jon Doggett: Well, I have no doubt that whatever the future holds you'll meet it with the same expertise and enthusiasm that you've brought to the Congress and to our issues. As we've worked with you throughout these years, Congresswoman Cheri Bustos from Illinois 17th district recipient of the NCGA president's award. Thank you for joining us on this conversation and thank you so much for all that you have done for the corn industry and for this great nation. Rep. Cheri Bustos: Thank you Jon, I appreciate it. Thank you Dusty for the opportunity. And please look at me as I'm not just your friend for the next 16 months, which is, my term will end on January 3rd, 2023, but from here on out, I believe in what you're doing. I want you to be successful and I hope I can be part of the solution and hopefully never part of the problem. Jon Doggett: Well, thanks again. And we will definitely take you up on that. Rep. Cheri Bustos: Thank you, Jon. Jon Doggett: So with that, I'm, NCGA CEO, Jon Doggett, and we hope you'll join us again for the next episode of Wherever Jon May Roam the National Corn Growers Association podcast.

    "title": "NCGA to EPA: Dont Saddle Farmers with Unnecessary Water Regulations",
    "content": "Federal regulations on remote bodies of water will hurt farmers without providing any significant improvement to water quality, an NCGA leader told the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today. “They [EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers] must not assume that achieving desired water quality outcomes means that remote water features must be made waters of the U.S.,” said Andy Jobman, chair of NCGA’s Stewardship Action Team. “The facts simply do not support this assumption as it applies to farms, conservation practices and farmland water management.” Jobman’s remarks were made during a public meeting hosted by the EPA to hear from stakeholders on their perspectives on defining \"waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act, in light of the agency’s intention to revise the definition. During the hearing, Jobman expressed support for the goals of the Clean Water Act to restore and protect the water quality integrity of jurisdictional waters. “Corn farmers are committed to protecting this resource for the benefit of their crops, their communities and the planet,” he said. “We sincerely wish that we were not going through another WOTUS rulemaking where this artificially drawn ‘jurisdictional line’ in our watersheds will again be hotly debated and litigated. Instead, we want to focus on working together to support our water quality protection efforts on our farms.” The definition of WOTUS is critically important to farmers, which is why NCGA has participated in numerous rulemakings and litigation on this issue over the years. NCGA is also a long-time member of the Waters Advocacy Coalition (WAC), which represents a large cross-section of the nation’s construction, transportation, real estate, mining, manufacturing, forestry, agriculture, energy, wildlife conservation and public health and safety sectors. The Coalition’s members are committed to the protection and restoration of America’s wetlands and waters. They work collectively to advocate for clear regulation that draws bright lines between federal and state waters that will help further those goals. NCGA is submitting recommendations individually and as a member of WAC in response to EPA’s notice soliciting pre-proposal feedback on defining WOTUS.",

    "title": "NCGAs Linder Tells EPA to Turn to Ethanol to Address Greenhouse Gas Emissions",
    "content": "Policymakers can meet their ambitious goals of quickly lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by turning to biofuels like ethanol, National Corn Growers Association President John Linder told the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this week. “EPA’s proposal for vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards for 2023 through 2026 is an ambitious increase,” Linder said. “The good news is we don’t have to wait to reduce emissions. Thanks to today’s ethanol, we can use fuel available right now to make a difference.” His comments came as EPA conducted public hearings on proposed revised emission standards for light-duty vehicles for model year 2023 through 2026 and as the Biden Administration announced a goal of achieving a 50% to 52% reduction in greenhouse gas by 2030. Linder was one of several stakeholders providing input to EPA at the virtual public hearing. Looking at all possible solutions will ensure the country can take advantage of not only the low-carbon benefits of higher ethanol blends but also the consumer cost savings, cuts in toxic emissions and greater fuel efficiency that come with using more renewables, he argued. “Higher ethanol blends used with advanced engines optimized for higher octane would provide a much-needed path for automakers to meet stricter standards on both GHG emissions and fuel economy,” he noted. In addition to advocating for EPA to establish a low-carbon, high-octane standard to enable fuel and vehicles to work as a system to lower emissions, Linder reminded EPA that flex-fuel vehicles that can run on 85% ethanol, or E85, deserve a second look as zero-emission vehicles and could be incentivized through vehicle standards rules. A year ago this week, then-candidate for U.S. President, Joe Biden said his Administration would prioritize biofuels. “The Obama-Biden Administration kept our word to farmers,” Biden said during the 2020 campaign. “A Biden-Harris Administration will promote and advance renewable energy, ethanol, and other biofuels to help rural America and our nation’s farmers and will honor the critical role the renewable fuel industry plays in supporting the rural economy and the leadership role American agriculture will play in our fight against climate change.” Linder said NCGA would provide written comments addressing specific ways EPA could support greater use of ethanol as a pathway to meet stricter vehicle emissions and fuel efficiency standards.",

    "title": "Next Generation Fuels Act Provides Key Piece of the Clean Energy Solution",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) today welcomed the reintroduction of The Next Generation Fuels Act (H.R. 5089), legislation to transition gasoline and vehicles to low-carbon, higher octane fuel to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and meet future needs of more advanced vehicles by taking advantage of the benefits of higher ethanol blends. The legislation is sponsored by Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill). “Ethanol is uniquely positioned to immediately and affordably decarbonize transportation, including through paving the way to future vehicles with greater fuel efficiency and fewer emissions,” said NCGA President John Linder. “The Renewable Fuel Standard was a game-changer for corn farmers, and the Next Generation Fuels Act builds on that success in advancing our commitment to providing the cleanest, most efficient and lowest cost energy solution.” The bill would require that automakers phase in higher levels of clean, low-carbon octane by model year 2031. The higher the octane, the more efficiently the engine uses energy. As a clean octane standard, the bill requires that sources of additional octane result in at least 40% fewer GHG emissions than unblended gasoline and sets new limits on toxic hydrocarbon aromatics. These requirements will reduce GHG and tailpipe emissions to build on the progress already made to lower emissions with cleaner renewable fuels. Through advanced engine design features that take advantage of this new fuel, automakers will be able to significantly improve vehicle fuel efficiency. “Today’s ethanol results in nearly 50% fewer GHG emissions than gasoline, and ongoing improvements in farming practices and carbon capture technology can bring ethanol to net-zero emissions,” said Linder. “Corn growers support market-based clean fuel policies that incentivize low-carbon fuels, and the Next Generation Fuels Act would complement these policies, advancing greater decarbonization per gallon.” Corn ethanol is an effective, low-carbon octane source, providing the greatest fuel efficiency gains at the least cost to drivers while displacing the most toxic components of gasoline. Higher octane levels and vehicles designed and warranted for these fuels would support ethanol blends up to 30%, which would decrease GHG emissions and improve air quality by replacing harmful hydrocarbon aromatics. NCGA expressed appreciation for the members of Congress who joined Rep. Bustos as original co-sponsors of the bill, including Representatives Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), Jason Smith (R-Mo.), James Comer (R-Ky.), Darin LaHood (R-Ill.) and Cynthia Axne (D-Iowa). “Congresswoman Bustos has been a real champion for the benefits of low-carbon ethanol and for agriculture,” Linder said. “NCGA is thankful for the Congresswoman’s leadership in advancing renewable fuels by reintroducing this legislation. Corn growers look forward to working with her to build support for clean energy policies that take greater advantage of ethanol’s benefits.” More information on the benefits of low-carbon, high-octane fuels and NCGA’s support for a low-carbon octane standard can be found at ncga.com/octane.",

    "title": "CommonGround: Helping Consumers Say Goodbye to Mom Guilt",
    "content": "Women from farms across the country, along with state and national staff, came together last week for this year’s CommonGround Summit. Over the course of two days, attendees participated in experiences that built skills, sparked insights, and fostered ideas that will empower the volunteers in their efforts and energize the program as a whole. Through presentations from experts and group exercises, participants and honed the skills that they use to share their personal story. Highlights included a look at Building Bridges on Tricky Topics with Roxi Beck of the Center for Food Integrity (CFI) and a consumer panel featuring a diverse group of local moms, led by Allyson Perry, also of CFI. The diverse group of local consumer moms shared their concerns and the personal experiences that influence them, in an open, honest manner. As the moderator and volunteers brought forth questions that scratched beneath the surface, the common concerns that bother families everywhere and underlying values that make us more alike than different became apparent. The conversation brought forth noticeable themes such as the desire to stretch hard-earned dollars, to create quality time in hectic schedules and to do what is best, as best as possible, for each member of their family. “Through my work with the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), and with the Nebraska Corn Growers Association, I already respected and supported CommonGround. Meeting volunteers from across the country and seeing their passion for supporting agriculture brought the program to life in a way that deepened my respect and appreciation,” said NCGA Member and Consumer Action Team Vice Chair Dan Nerud, who was also in attendance. “The support and collaboration I saw among four generations of farm women makes me excited to see the impact CommonGround will make well into the future.” Conference offers the volunteers and staff a chance to share experiences gained through program participation over the past years, including the unique insights gained and innovations made since the last conference in March of 2019. This cross-pollination and grassroots-focused approach allows efforts to grow and innovate to meet the moment. CommonGround is a grassroots movement to foster conversation among women — on farms and in cities — about where our food comes from. Developed and supported collaboratively by the National Corn Growers Association, and state corn and soy associations. Since it began more than ten years ago, CommonGround has created more than 1.5 billion touchpoints through the grassroots efforts of more than 200 volunteers.

    "title": "Biofuel and Farm Group Intervenors File Petition for Rehearing of D.C Circuit RVP Decision",
    "content": "Growth Energy, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), and the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) filed a petition for rehearing with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the recent American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, et al. vs. EPA decision, in which the court vacated a 2019 regulation allowing year-round sales of a fifteen percent ethanol fuel blend (E15). The petition asks the full court to rehear the case because of significant legal errors in the three-judge panel’s decision, handed down on July 2nd. Together, the three national organizations stated: “If allowed to stand, this court’s decision to vacate EPA’s rulemaking to allow E15 to be sold year-round will have devastating consequences for the market expansion of homegrown biofuels. Petitioning for a rehearing is a critical next step in giving biofuel producers and farmers a fair shot in the marketplace and providing American drivers with better access to cleaner fuel choices. We are hopeful that the full court takes up the petition and reverses the panel’s decision.” The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 2019 rule by the Environmental Protection Agency that lifted outdated restrictions on the sale of E15. The case, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, et al. vs. EPA, was a challenge by oil refiners to the rulemaking that allowed the year-round sale of E15. Background: In June 2019, EPA issued its final rule extending the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) volatility waiver to E15, and found that E15 is substantially similar to E10 certification fuel, allowing the fuel to be sold year-round in conventional gasoline markets. Oil refiners soon challenged the rulemaking in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in an attempt to undermine the expansion of biofuels in our nation’s fuel supply. On August 21, 2020, Growth Energy, RFA, and NCGA filed a brief as intervenors in the oil industry’s lawsuit against EPA’s regulation allowing year-round E15. The brief provided strong support for EPA’s position that parity in RVP regulations for E10 and E15 is consistent with the provisions of the Clean Air Act and the congressional intent behind those provisions. The organizations further pointed out that extending the volatility waiver from E10 to E15 is appropriate because the volatility of the fuel actually decreases as more ethanol is added into gasoline beyond E10. Growth Energy, NCGA, and RFA participated in oral arguments for the case on April 13, 2021.",

Panelists will discuss sustainability practices on their farms, the benefits of next-generation feed products, how the ethanol industry has impacted corn and beef producers, and more. The episode was filmed at the Certified Angus Beef headquarters in Wooster, Ohio with panelists from the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), NCBA, and Certified Angus Beef (CAB). “It is important for corn farmers and beef producers to work together so both industries remain sustainable, both environmentally and economically, for the years to come,” said NCGA President John Linder. “Beef cattle is one of our largest customers. One out of four bushels of added corn demand is due to beef and pork exports, with the beef industry providing $5.7 billion in corn value and consuming 1.2 billion bushels of grain. DDGS account for nearly 8 percent of total domestic corn usage.” NCBA's Cattlemen to Cattlemen is a television show for cattlemen created by cattlemen. The episode featuring corn growers is not scheduled yet but will air on RFD-TV. The show is hosted by Colorado cattle producer Kevin Ochsner. Panel participants include Bruce Cobb, Executive Vice President of Production for Certified Angus Beef; NCGA President and Ohio farmer John Linder; Brandon Hunnicutt, a Nebraska farmer and NCGA corn board member; Ohio Corn and Wheat Growers Association Vice President Ben Klick, who raises both corn and beef; and NCBA President-Elect and Minnesota farmer Don Schiefelbein.

    "title": "NCGA: Passage of Senate Infrastructure Bill a Positive Development that Would Benefit Farmers",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) applauds the U.S. Senate for today’s passage of the bipartisan infrastructure package, which includes investments in important areas to corn growers. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime investment in America’s infrastructure, and we are extremely pleased that it includes funding for priorities that are important to farmers and rural America,” said President of the National Corn Growers Association John Linder. “The legislation will benefit agriculture for years to come, and it is encouraging for corn farmers to see Senators working together on a bipartisan basis.” Among the items included in the bill: $17.3 billion for the nation’s ports and inland waterways. With 60% of corn exports utilizing these waterways, NCGA and coalition partners have a track record of advocating for these key resources. $65 billion for broadband internet access, including $2 billion specifically for rural broadband, which will provide more farmers and residents of rural areas with high-speed internet access. An estimated 29% of farmers don’t have access to internet service, an important tool for marketing crops and planning for planting season. “Whether it’s shipping corn and corn products on America’s highways and waterways or using technology to order supplies or sell crops, farmers rely on a safe, stable and reliable national infrastructure,” Linder said. “Corn growers need these investments in infrastructure to continue to be successful and competitive globally.” While NCGA supports many aspects of the bill, NCGA was disappointed the Senate did not take up important amendments to fund infrastructure to support the use of higher ethanol blends and to provide a narrow fix to ensure continued full market access for ethanol blends at 15% of the volume of gasoline year-round (E15), Linder said. “Greater market deployment of higher ethanol blends would immediately lower greenhouse gas emissions and help clean the air, and higher blends save consumers money at the pump,” he said. “We will continue to work with members of Congress and the Biden Administration on pathways to include infrastructure and other support for higher blends of biofuels as an effective clean energy solution.” Linder said he thanks Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) for submitting a biofuels infrastructure amendment and Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Deb Fischer (R-N.E.) and 11 bipartisan co-sponsors for filing an amendment to ensure continued year-round access to E15. The legislation, which does not include tax increases for individuals or corporations as previously proposed, now goes to the House of Representatives.",

    "title": "Biofuel and Ag Leaders Call for Accountable Life Cycle Analysis for SAF Tax Credits",
    "content": "On Friday, Growth Energy, American Farm Bureau Federation, National Biodiesel Board, National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, and the Renewable Fuels Association sent a letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance and the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means outlining its recommendations for a sound and effective sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) tax credit. In an effort to decarbonize transportation and reduce aviation emissions, Congress is considering new legislation to establish a tax credit to promote and develop robust domestic SAF production. To be successful, the ag and biofuels coalition notes in their letter, the tax credit must be based on accurate carbon accounting in life cycle analysis (LCA) led by the U.S. Department of Energy: “Numerous members of our respective organizations are poised to produce SAF or sustainable feedstocks for SAF. Many others are looking to work toward participation in the full value chain in the relatively near future. We recognize the importance of decarbonizing the aviation sector with low-carbon liquid fuels. Because biomass feedstocks are essential SAF sources, it is imperative that the tax credit properly account for the lifecycle emissions of these sources and the petroleum products these new fuels will replace. “We urge you to make the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) the lead agency in establishing a regularly updated LCA for any SAF credit. Across our federal government, DOE has the best resources, expertise, and current ability to assess lifecycle emissions fairly and scientifically.” The letter also pointed out that carbon intensity estimates under the International Civil Aviation Organization for some SAF sources are “wildly inaccurate and incorrectly penalized” and cannot be supported.

    "title": "NCGA: Ethanol Crucial in Helping President Meet Emission Reduction Goals",
    "content": "President Biden today announced proposed revisions to the vehicle fuel efficiency and emissions standards through model-year 2026 and a non-binding executive order setting a goal of making half of new vehicles sold in 2030 electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Automakers have previously announced similar goals. “Time is of the essence if we’re going to meet the President’s ambitious goals for reducing emissions,” said John Linder, president of the National Corn Growers Association. “The good news is we don’t have to wait until 2030 for new vehicles and technologies to reduce emissions. Thanks to today’s ethanol, we can use fuel available right now, in the vehicles we’re all driving today, to make a difference.” Using higher volumes of ethanol is an immediate way to lower greenhouse gas emissions, and more low-carbon liquid fuels will be needed to decarbonize transportation on a timely and affordable basis, Linder added. “We encourage policymakers to focus more on outcomes and less on the specific technologies to reach these goals,” said Linder. “The most recent analysis from the Department of Energy shows that today’s ethanol reduces emissions by about half compared to gasoline, due in large part to our sustainable corn production. With our commitments to continued improvements, farmers are ready to help ensure clean, renewable ethanol reaches net-zero emissions.” NCGA will continue to advocate for policies that allow consumers to take greater advantage of ethanol’s low-carbon, lower-emission and lower-cost benefits, Linder said. NCGA will submit comments on today’s proposed fuel efficiency and emissions standards rule that highlight how higher blends of ethanol used with advanced engines, as well as flex-fuel vehicles, provide important pathways for automakers to meet stricter standards. In Congress, Representatives and Senators recently introduced H.R. 4410, the Year-round Fuel Choice Act and S. 2339, the Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act. These bills would narrowly update the law to ensure fuel containing 15% ethanol will continue to have market access on the same terms as standard 10% ethanol-blended fuels. The legislation was introduced in response to a recent court decision reversing EPA’s 2019 actions to ensure full market access for E15. Allowing for the year-round use of ethanol at these levels would eliminate 17.6 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions a year, the equivalent of removing 3.8 million vehicles from the road. “We ask Congress and the President to work together to address pressing environmental and economic concerns, including finding a durable solution to allow continued market access and expansion for proven low-carbon fuel in E15 and by including infrastructure for higher blends of biofuels in the infrastructure packages. These near-term steps help level the playing field and provide immediate emissions reductions, supporting longer-term policy efforts.” To support ethanol policy solutions and educate policymakers about the benefits of low-carbon ethanol, NCGA recently launched a campaign in the nation’s capital to outline the immediate environmental benefits of the biofuel. The digital campaign is made up of videos on streaming services, video on local websites in Washington and social media marketing on Facebook and Instagram targeting decision-makers. In addition, the campaign includes sponsored Agri-Pulse Podcast Deep Dive series on biofuels and sponsored content in Politico.",

    "content": "On June 8 of this year, The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) released its U.S. Corn Sustainability Goals and the first U.S. Corn Sustainability Report. The release of both the report and the sustainability goals is the culmination of an 18-month, farmer-led process; the report documents a long history of continuous improvement by U.S. corn farmers and the goals set targets for further progress over the next decade. Looking back over more than the last decade, corn farmers across the country have adopted practices to defend against soil erosion, improve water quality and water use, and manage resources and nutrients through continuous improvements found in modern farming. From 1980 – 2015: More corn is being produced on less land. The amount of land required to produce a bushel of corn decreased by 41%. Per bushel, energy use decreased by 41%, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions decreased by 31%. Through the adoption of practices that reduce soil erosion, farmers reduced soil loss per acre by 58%. While only 14% of corn production is irrigated, those who irrigate have decreased irrigation water use by 46% per bushel. Setting goals for further sustainability progress is the next phase of this storied history. Farmer-leaders of NCGA established five environmental national efficiency goals to be met by 2030: Increase land-use efficiency by 12%. Increase irrigation water use efficiency by 15%. Reduce soil erosion by 13%. Increase energy use efficiency by 13%. Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 13%. “Through NCGA’s Sustainability Report, we have showcased not only what corn growers have accomplished historically, but also their continued dedication to increasing sustainability and efficiency now and for future generations to come,” said Nebraska farmer and NCGA Stewardship Action Team Chair Andy Jobman. “My brother and I are the fifth generation of our family to operate our farm. I would love to see that continue for another five generations. But that can’t happen without a conscious commitment to evolving and improving environmental, social and economic sustainability practices.” NCGA’s open comment period for farmers, customers and others to provide feedback on the report and sustainability goals closes on Sunday, August 8: Corn Sustainability Report and 2030 Goals Public Comment Form.

    "content": "The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill this week that would allocate millions of dollars in funding to improve the navigability of the Upper Mississippi River System, a vital national artery for the shipment of corn and other crops. “Corn growers depend on the Mississippi River to deliver corn to key markets. When barges are delayed because of problems on the river, farmers are economically affected,” said Brooke Appleton, Vice President of Public Policy for the National Corn Growers Association. “That’s why we have worked closely with members of Congress to get funding for this project passed.” The House bill, which includes appropriations funding on other issues, provides $8.66 billion to the Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works Mission. From those funds, $22.5 million will go toward construction funding for the Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program (NESP). NESP funding will be used to construct new locks on the river and help address efficiency issues with existing locks and dams. The funding will also be used to improve conditions for fish and wildlife. More than 60% of the nation’s corn and soybeans are transported on the Mississippi River. But an aging system – many of the locks were constructed between 1907 and 1936 – has led to delays and closures along the river. Farmers often feel the economic impact from these problems, and this project will help ensure the river system’s long-term viability. The Senate has yet to take up appropriations bills for the 2022 fiscal year, which begins in October of this year. NCGA will advocate that funding for the NESP program also be prioritized in the Senate’s version of the bill.",

    "content": "Corn and ethanol still have an important role to play in fueling America’s transportation needs. Between a couple of recent high-profile court cases and all the hype surrounding electric vehicles, stakeholders in the corn and ethanol industry are looking for a little reassurance right now. But the reality of the transportation energy puzzle is a little more complex than what you’ve heard on the news. So in this episode, we’re joined by John Eichberger, executive director of the Fuels Institute, for a reality check about the present and future of the transportation energy sector. Together with NCGA CEO Jon Doggett, he discusses the shifting makeup of the American transportation fleet, the hurdles to mass adoption that electric vehicles still face, the probable impact of recent court cases, and why ethanol remains the best option for decarbonizing American transportation today. Direct Share Link TRANSCRIPT John Eichberger: There are very low carbon solutions out there, that I'm concerned are not being given the attention they deserve because of this fascination or fixation on EVs are the solution and biofuels are currently the best option for reducing the carbon intensity of our transportation fuel, we've got to pay attention to it. Dusty Weis: Welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, The National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis. I'll be introducing your host association, CEO, John Doggett. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway we're making sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: Between a couple of recent high profile court cases and all the hype surrounding electric vehicles, stakeholders in the corn and ethanol industry are looking for a little reassurance right now. But the reality of the transportation energy puzzle is a little more complex than you've heard on the news. In this episode, we're joined by John Eichberger, executive director of The Fuels Institute for a reality check about the present and future of the transportation energy sector. But if you haven't yet make sure you're subscribed to this podcast and your favorite app, also make sure you follow NCGA on Twitter @NationalCorn and sign up for The National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. Dusty Weis: With that, it's time to once again, introduce John. John Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association, and John I'm old enough to remember a time when ethanol was the next big thing in clean and renewable fuels. Twenty years ago, it was being celebrated as a homegrown solution to America's energy independence, and an environmentally sound way power our cars and trucks. Jon Doggett: Dusty, I remember back in about 2007, 2008, I was walking down the hall in a house office building on Capitol Hill, and I had a member of Congress who I had never spoken to before approached me and said, \"You're the corn guy, aren't you?\" I said, \"Yes, sir. I'm the corn guy.\" He said, \"Well, I want to do an ethanol bill.\" He was from the east coast. He was not from middle America. I said, \"What kind of ethanol bill do you want to do?\" He said, \"I don't care. I really think it's cool. It's cool stuff. It's renewable. This is great. I want to do something.\" I've been around Washington for a very long time and there's an ebb and flow. We've seen ethanol go up, and we've seen ethanol come down. We've seen ethanol go up. Jon Doggett: We've got some issues right now. If you looked at the headlines and the court cases that seem to always come out on a Friday afternoon, you'd come away thinking, boy, we got some huge, huge problems with ethanol, but Dusty what we wanted to do today was take this opportunity for a quick reality check on what's really going on with the corn ethanol industry, and to do that, we're bringing in one of the world's foremost authorities representing one of the broadest coalitions of industry stakeholders that's out there. I've known John Eichberger for a long, long time and he is now the executive director of The Fuels Institute, a research organization that studies transportation energy solutions. John, thank you so much for joining this podcast. John Eichberger: Thanks, Jon. It's great to be with you guys and great to see you. It has been a long time. We got to know each other back when we both had hair a long time ago. Jon Doggett: Yeah. I almost remember those days. John, give us a self-introduction. Where are you from? How did you end up in Washington? I always think that's such an interesting question to ask people who live and work in Washington, DC. How did you get here and then what happened? John Eichberger: I was born a slow-witted Californian. Graduated from Santa Barbara and moved to DC, started working for a trade association, representing meatpackers and slaughterhouses. Then I moved to Capitol hill where you and I met. I was working for Congressman Greg Gansky out of the great state of Iowa. I remember I was his agriculture energy environment guy, and my first week or two on the job, got this letter from [inaudible 00:04:23] asking about his position on the ethanol so I turned to my legislative director go, \"Hey, how does congressmen feel that ethanol, we're from Iowa?\" I said, \"That doesn't help me. What's ethanol?\" John Eichberger: I realized how much I had to learn. I did about two years up on Capitol Hill because that's really all I could stand of that jungle. I went to the convenience store industry where I represented fuel retailers before Congress, the administration, the media, I'm still part of that team since 2000. Then we founded The Fuels Institute back in 2013 to start providing some objective analysis of what's going on in the transportation space. So, it's been a great ride. It's an industry that has so many moving parts and it's been an absolute pleasure to be part of it. Jon Doggett: John Eichberger as I've learned more about you and your organization, one thing that I keep hearing is what a broad and interesting coalition of stakeholders you represent. Who are your stakeholders at The Fuels Institute? What's your mission and whom be represented? John Eichberger: The reason we can have a broad diverse group is we don't have any positions. We don't advocate for anything. We really don't care what happens. We just want people to use real information to make decisions. We've started The Fuels Institute with two primary objectives. One, we wanted to get the different components of the transportation energy space talking to one another more often. When we launched it, you had a situation [inaudible 00:05:45] silos. You had the auto industry in one side, refiners on one side, the biofield guys another side, and the convenience retailers and the customers were caught in the middle. John Eichberger: The impetus for the fuel centers is, can we get these groups start working together to have more sustainable in terms of long life policies that make sense. Then the other thing was when you try to find out what the future is going to be, most research starts with a conclusion and reverse engineers it. We want to start with the questions and provide objective data and analysis to help business leaders and policymakers make better-informed decisions. John Eichberger: Our organization includes refiners, biofuel producers, retailers, automakers, equipment providers, technical experts from the national labs, other industry experts, big engine manufacturers, truck manufacturers, fleet operators. A whole swath of stakeholders who understand the market, at least from their perspective, can come together and paint a really big, broad picture of what is feasible, what's practical and what we should be looking at. Jon Doggett: It's always good to have somebody come and take an objective look at what you're doing and what's your positioning. We tend to not only to get into silos, but we tend to lose a little perspective, and that's why I think having you present to our ethanol committee and other opportunities, we all need that. We need to have this perspective that like you say, we've arrived at the conclusion that ethanol is great and then we back engineer it. Jon Doggett: I still think ethanol is great, but it's nice to have that other perspective coming from a broad spectrum of the industry. That's helpful to the discussion. I've been in the policy arena long enough to know that when you bring all the perspectives to the table in an unbiased fashion, you sometimes can even come out of the other end of that with some pretty good solutions. John Eichberger: Jon, the thing is we get trapped in our own echo chambers. We talk to people who think like us who want the same things as we do and you can get blindsided that way. Quick anecdote. One of my former directors at The Fuels Institute, before he agreed to serve on the board, came to one of our conferences and I heard him tell this story to his executive team afterwards. \"The first couple of hours man, I was angry. Here's these people in this room talking about my business. They're not in my business. They don't understand my business. What are they talking about?\" John Eichberger: Then I mellowed out and started paying attention and realized we're all serving the same customer at the end of the day. We're all facing similar challenges. We're all trying to do pretty much the same thing and we can learn from one another, and we start breaking down those barriers and those deep seated instinctive animosities, you're right, John, you can come out with some great solutions. Then you've got to sell it to Capitol Hill, which is a whole different animal that I don't have to worry about anymore because I'm at a lobbying gig. I call myself a recovering lobbyists because it's a poison you can never actually get out of your system, but I'm much happier on this side of the equation. Dusty Weis: All right John Eichberger, you guys sit there from 30,000 feet you look down at the transportation energy sector, what are you seeing right now? What are the major trends that we're seeing play out? John Eichberger: Clearly the global momentum is on carbon reduction. That's captured the mindset of most of the politically elected leaders in the world. It is the dominant conversation regarding transportation, and what has happened unfortunately I think is policy makers like to have a simple message to communicate and they have bought into the fact that zero emission vehicles are the future, and that anything we can do to accelerate the marketability of electric vehicles or fuel cell electric vehicles we have to do. There is a huge role for electrified vehicles, absolutely, without a doubt. They play a significant role in decarbonizing transportation. But the challenge has become this, we have, the collective we, become so focused on reducing carbon, and so many leaders have adopted a solution, one solution, at all costs electrify. [inaudible 00:09:53] we're missing the boat. It is going to take decades to transition the fleet to a new technology. John Eichberger: In the interim, what are we doing to decarbonize our existing fleet of 266, 270 million light duty vehicles? How are we going to reduce the carbon intensity of our liquid transportation fuel, improve the efficiency of our combustion engines? We have to do both because even if electric vehicles to gain 40, 50% of the market, we're still going to have combustion vehicles on the road for decades, probably to the end of the century, if not longer. John Eichberger: There are very low carbon solutions out there that I'm concerned are not being given the attention they deserve because of this fascination or fixation on EVs are the solution. We have got to open up the dialogue to address the other opportunities. Quite frankly, like I said, The Fuels Intistute doesn't advocate for any solution. We advocate for the right solutions and biofuels are currently the best option for reducing the carbon intensity of our transportation fuel, we've got to pay attention to it. Jon Doggett: John Eichbeiger, you're talking about everybody's all about electric vehicles, and I have to imagine right now that there's probably an electric vehicle manufacturer lobbyists walking down a hallway in a house office building on Capitol Hill and somebody saying, \"You're the electric car guy, right? I want to do an electric car bill. I don't know anything about it, but I want to do one.\" It's fad, definitely. There will be a lot electric cars on the road, but policy makers want simple solutions. This is so complex and so difficult to work through, and it takes people who come to the right tables and figure out how to get through all of that. John Eichberger: I'm a historian and I believe you have to look at history for lessons about the future. We've seen this movie play out multiple times, you guys upfront and personal. At one time, biofuels renewable fuels were the solution. The environmental community was 100% behind it. Then I started getting momentum and environmental community started poking holes at it. The environmental committee is 100% behind electric vehicles. John Eichberger: At some point, they're going to turn their attention to some of the not as environmentally friendly components of the electric vehicle market. We saw the automakers in 2008 commit to produce half of their vehicles to be flexible vehicles, that didn't happen. Now, the commitments on investments in electric vehicles, there's a lot of reasons for that. Some of them are economic, but you know what, 10, 15, 20 years is a long time in policy and in public sentiment and I don't believe electric vehicles are a fad. John Eichberger: I believe they're going to be here for a very long time. I think they're fantastic vehicles, a wonderful technology. They don't fit every use case. They don't fit every consumer's needs. They don't fit everything they're being tried to be forced into, and so what we've been talking about is let's be strategic about our deployment of solutions to maximize our effectiveness and minimize the cost of the end user. That's what we need to be focused on. Let's reduce emissions and let's benefit the consumer. John Eichberger: If we do that sustainable policies that are environmentally sustainable, but are not economically sustainable, they'll fail. If we focus on emissions, reductions and consumer protection, we're going to come up with successful plan that will stand the test of time. That's the only way we can be successful at this. But unfortunately, in order to get to that point, as we've seen over the decades that we've been watching this market, you have to have policies that fail, market strategies that fail, and then people come back to the table, okay, why did it fail and what can we do differently? That's painful, unfortunately. Dusty Weis: John Eichberger, let's drill down on this a little bit then, who is buying electric vehicles right now and why are they choosing to drive one? John Eichberger: Right now we're still on the early mover stage of adoption. We've just now recently eclipsed 2% of sales in the first quarter of this year, [inaudible 00:13:54] electric. That's not a revolution despite what the headlines tell you, it's an evolution, but it's accelerating, we're getting more and more buying. Most of the people buying them, according to a report we just published at The Fuels Institute are going to be your college-educated, 150,000 a year income. They have a home with a garage. They're tech savvy. They like the technology. They have an environmental perspective that they want to be good for the environment. John Eichberger: They have a societal status perspective. They want to demonstrate and communicate their commitment to technology and environment through their car. But that's a very small component and they're very segmented geographically. It's not geographically dispersed evenly. As we progress and as more vehicles come on the market, as more utility vehicles and electric powertrains become available, as costs come down, you're going to see the demographic profile the EV driver normalize, and you're going to have younger people buying vehicles that can pay $25,000 for a vehicle. John Eichberger: You're going to have people living in apartment complexes that aren't going to have access at home charging so they're going to need publicly available charging infrastructure. It's going to normalize. But I think the problem we get into is, I am convinced that within the next five, six years, you'll be able to buy an electric vehicle for about the same price as a combustion engine, without a tax credit, that vehicle is going to have 300-mile range per charge. John Eichberger: You're going to be able to recharge it in 15, 20 minutes. It's going to have amenities. It's going to be the body style you want. That does not mean the consumer is going to buy it, and that's the key. That's what I think is motivating some of these advocates that we need to ban combustion sales to force consumers to buy these vehicles. Consumer choice is being thrown out the window because I don't think consumers are automatically switch. John Eichberger: Some of them will, but we have a long way to go. When you think about the smartphone and people use the smartphone analogy. If we're uptake as a scenario that can be mimicked by EVs, the smartphone delivered an immediate convenience improvement to your way of life and EV may offer an economic improvement, but it introduces a level of inconvenience regard to energy acquisition that doesn't exist with an ICE, and it is now a compromise, it is a choice. It's not a brand new thing. You're substituting one thing for another and you're making trade-offs and not all customers are going to make those trade-offs. Jon Doggett: It's interesting, I had a conversation the other night with a gentleman who talks about, his dad buys a new pickup every three years. He trades the pickup off for the down payment and he takes out a three-year loan. Does it over and over and over again that used pickup sits on the lot, somebody else buys it and they're trading in an even older pickup to go ahead and spread the payment over 3, 4, 5, 6 years. You have people in other economic categories who are dependent on that progression of where these vehicles go. Jon Doggett: But if you have to replace a battery in an electric vehicle after 6, 7, 8 years, what's that do to the ultimate end-user, that person who not only doesn't own a home, but is maybe a backyard mechanic who can work on a combustion engine, but is not going to have the ability to go ahead and switch out that battery, that's expensive. We talk about the first purchaser of the electric vehicle. Are we thinking about the third purchaser of that vehicle? Because that has been the way that much of our society has got their first car, and been able to drive to their first job. We've got to think about the societal side on that as well. John Eichberger: You raise a great point because we sell 16, 17 million new vehicles a year. We sell 42 million used vehicles a year in the United States. If you're paying attention to what the dialogue is in public policy forums, the issue of environmental and energy equity is a huge issue. How do we make sure disadvantaged communities or quite frankly, rural communities have access to affordable, reliable transportation, because affordable, reliable transportation is an absolute essential need for economic prosperity and growth. John Eichberger: If we're going to be driving the market, no pun intended to a vehicle technology that the new vehicles might be out of the reach of the lower-income consumer, and then when they hit the used car market, Jon, to your point, maybe their actual extended useful life is shorter than the ICE engine. They replaced that lower-income consumers going to buy a vehicle that has a shorter life expectancy and they're going to get trapped in an economic cycle that they may not be able to get out of. John Eichberger: We need to think about these things because you can impose a solution that benefits the wealthy communities and disadvantages the lower-income communities. I don't think we've thought this through all the way, how that's going to materialize. A lot of people have brought the subject, \"Well, it's going to figure itself out John, it'll take care of itself.\" John Eichberger: Is that how we want to be framing the future for transportation space on expectation? Hope that's all going to be resolved well, and I don't think so. I think we need to take these things into very careful consideration. There may be solutions that will support an EV market. There may be solutions that may not, but we need to really think these things through so that we don't come around a corner and go, holy cow, we didn't even think about that, because that's disastrous. Jon Doggett: You're right. We haven't thought about this stuff. We got to start thinking about all of this stuff and there's so much to think about, but I think we're going to have plenty of time to work through it because these problems are going to start cropping up. John Eichberger: Years ago, a good friend of ours in the ethanol industry, he looked at me one time to say, \"John, John with you. It's always the negatives and the problems.\" My response is no, it's the recognition there's hurdles. To be successful, you have to know where there's hurdles are, so you can get over them. When I raise questions like this about the electric vehicle market and the future of transportation, a lot of people go, John, all you're doing is you're just blasting. It's like, no, if we don't think about these things and contemplate and consider them and incorporate them in our plans, everything's going to fall apart and it's not being negative. It's not being disingenuous. Let's not be stupid. Let's actually be smart about this. We've been in Washington area for a long time, that is not always the popular statement. Dusty Weis: John Eichberger, executive director of The Fuels Institute. What about the internal combustion engine then? What is in the future for traditional fuel burning transportation? Are we waving the white flag and throwing in the towel on it? John Eichberger: I think that'd be foolish. I get into debates with some of the OEMs about this quite a bit because several of them are all in on electric, and the internal combustion engine is on its last legs John, why are you still talking about it? I put a lot more faith in EV than I do ICE as the future. I'm not in that camp. I think the combustion engine is going to be here for a very, very long time. Take this consideration. John Eichberger: Let's assume Bloomberg new energy finance forecast when they said 60% of new cars sold in 2040 would be electric. Let's say that comes true. Quite frankly, I don't think it can without government heavy intervention. I don't think the consumers are going to do that, but let's say it happens at that rate, that's only 27% fleet conversion in 20 years, which means 73% of vehicles on the road and 40% of new vehicles will still be combustion engine, and those vehicles have a 20 by then probably a 30-year life expectancy. John Eichberger: You're looking at combustion engines in the market in that aggressive BEV battery electric vehicle scenario into 2070, 2080. I believe that quite frankly, that we have the ability to bring combustion engines with a low carbon fuel option and be zero carbon. It can be done, but we cannot ignore the R&D that's being done currently to achieve that because we have a shiny new solution floating out there. John Eichberger: We do need to perfect the electric vehicle market develop that market because it has so many positives to it, but at the same time, we have to make sure we're doing anything we can to improve the efficiency of the combustion engine, and there are things we can still do and improve the carbon intensity of the liquid fuel market. Then we can have solutions that fit the needs of society and they're all zero carbon. It can be done. We just have to be committed to multiple solutions and not be wed to one and only one. Jon Doggett: The other thing is on our way to zero emissions, how about, we can reduce emissions today using existing technology, using existing vehicles, and using existing infrastructure? I talked to a guy a couple of months ago and he was talking about buying an electric vehicle. I said, \"All right, but where's your electricity coming from?\" He said, \"Well, I'm going to put solar collectors up on my roof.\" I said, \"Okay, that's great.\" I said, \"So you want your car to be powered by solar energy then?\" \"Yeah.\" I said, \"What's ethanol?\" Dusty Weis: Nothing but sunlight that made a 94 million mile journey from the center of our solar system and crash-landed in a field in Iowa, I'll tell you. Jon Doggett: There you go. When I was down in Florida a couple of weeks ago, I was going by all of these large fields with all of these solar panels and then at one point there was a cornfield on the other side of the highway, I thought, hey, this is wonderful. We're generating solar energy here on both sides of the road. Dusty Weis: What role then John Dogget, CEO of The National Corn Growers Association, what role does ethanol play in all of this? How does ethanol come in today and reduce those carbon emissions? Jon Doggett: Well, first of all, we need to increase the amount of ethanol in the fuel tank. We have been fighting against this false construct of a blend wall. But if we could go from E10 to E15, which we could do because we have the existing vehicles and the existing infrastructure and the existing production right now today to do that, that's going to be a massive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and that's the role. The role is to do it now with what we have. The perfect cannot stand in the way of the good, and I think right now we have something that's really, really good, and the thing that people are talking about being perfect is a long ways away from being here. Dusty Weis: You bring up an important point there you talk about the E15 blend and certainly a couple of recent court cases have resulted in some pretty negative headlines about the ethanol industry this summer. Could we take a look at those real quick, what was decided and what does it actually mean? Jon Doggett: Well, I think there's two things. It epitomizes. One of the forces that were working against. The first case was about small refinery exemptions. The oil industry came in and said, we need to be able to have small refinery exemptions and don't put any impediments in there, and a part of that is these rent prices are too high. A week later on a Friday afternoon, we have another court case comes out and decides that the Trump administration didn't get it right with E15 summer driving deal. So, you got the oil companies on one side saying rent prices are too high, but then the next week they got a court case that says, hey, we're going to go ahead and not require you to use as much ethanol, so rent prices are going to keep going back up. Jon Doggett: It's crazy. This is the problem with the petroleum industry is, they are complaining about moving to a new technology. They're complaining about moving to a new way of doing business. They need to be energy companies rather than oil companies. I think that's really important and we see some companies in that space starting to do that. They're starting to talk about we're an energy company, not an oil company. I think once we start making that pivot and quit worrying about where everybody's feedstock comes from, I think we've got some really fascinating things to move forward on. Dusty Weis: John Eichberger, from your perspective as executive director of The Fuels Institute, are these just temporary speed bumps for the corn ethanol industry are these longterm setbacks and what's going to be done about? John Eichberger: [inaudible 00:25:57] smaller finery exemptions, I don't know. I can envision a scenario where they continue to be played out because we're still struggling with cellulosic ethanol and finding the other buckets within the [inaudible 00:26:06] categories. On the E15 issue, I want to correct something that John said, there's no requirement to use E15, there is an opportunity to use that has been taken away by the court ruling. I never actually believed that the administration had the authority to provide the summer drive opportunity. John Eichberger: Trump administration did it. No problem. I think it's the right thing. E15 has a lower vapor pressure than E10. I don't understand why doesn't get the one pound waiver, except for the fact that when the Clean Air Act amendment one pound waiver was drafted 1990, E15 didn't exist. That's really the only reason it's not in the Clean Air Act. I think there's definitely scientific evidence that we should have it available year round, because it is better for the environment, it is a quality fuel. John Eichberger: Will EPA find a way to make that available without having to go to Congress, the ethanol industry better hope so, because I don't see this Congress and make-up and their preoccupation of the electrification doing anything to perpetuate the internal combustion engine and liquid fuels market. Maybe I'm wrong. I have been out of the game, the lobbying game for a long time. I don't even know who's in Congress anymore. I don't want to know. I forgot how to count to 218. I don't know what the makeup is, but my gut is that supporting liquid fuels and combustion engines is not on the agenda of the leadership in the house and Senate right now. That being said E15, to John's point, has great opportunities to reduce the carbon intensity of our transportation fuel. I have been talking to the biofuels industry and the oil industry for years about, look work together because if you can lower the carbon intensity to liquid fuels market and lower the carbon profile, the transportation space that perceived need to push electrification will be less. John Eichberger: You can slow down the replacement of your product in the market by being collaborative and doing everything you can to reduce the carbon intensity of the products you guys are selling. You can't sell ethanol without oil. You've got to have them working together, and quite frankly, if I'm in the oil industry, I'm thinking electric vehicles [inaudible 00:28:06] take all my demand or I'm going to team up with the biofuels industry to do something, to mitigate that. I'm making a couple of calls right now. I don't know if that's been happening. I hope it has. I have to hope it has, but there are opportunities here. We're talking about corn and ethanol, but there's a biodiesel side too. There's renewable diesel, there's renewable gasoline being tested over in Europe. There are a lot of opportunities and liquid fuel space and the biofuel component has great value. John Eichberger: We need to figure out and we have an opportunity policy-wise coming up with the RFS statutory volumetric provisions expiring [inaudible 00:28:42] kicked over to EPA, we have an opportunity to evaluate our federal fuels policy. How can we best leverage the carbon profile that biofuel sector in a way that matches infrastructure compatibility, vehicle compatibility and benefits consumers while reducing the carbon intensity. We have an opportunity here that should not be missed. I'm hopeful that those involved in [inaudible 00:29:06] process, do everything they can to figure out that right-size solution that gives us the opportunity to capitalize on that. Jon Doggett: So, John Eichberger, we always talk about what corn growers think and what ethanol producers think, and we think we talk about what we think the oil industry is talking about, but what about your members? What are they saying to you? What are their concerns? What is it that we need to know in the corn industry and in the ethanol industry? What do we need to know about what your folks are thinking about? John Eichberger: Let's redefine my folks. When you say my folks, I think you're going back to my previous job where I was representing retailers. Let's talk about fuel retailers. Fuel retailers are facing a lot of challenges. They're looking at a cafe program that when Mr. Biden resurrects the Obama era program will probably drop gasoline demand by 20 to 25% by 2040. They're looking at an unrelenting barrage of new stories and announcements saying electric vehicles are taking over and threatening their fuel sales. John Eichberger: Fuel sales represent two-thirds of the sales at a convenience store. [inaudible 00:30:14] put that in perspective, yet one-third a profit, 40% of gas customers go inside the store. That fuel island is critically important to the industry. On the flip side, they're spinning thousands upon thousands of dollars per site to be able to accept the chip-based credit cards. John Eichberger: They're also looking at a situation where their underground storage tanks are possibly nearing the end of their useful life of 30 years, they had to replace them between '88 and '98. Do the math. EPA estimates about 20% of storage tanks out there probably into the warranty, which means they need to be replaced yet. You're looking at a situation where demand is going to go down 20 to 30% the next 20 years. You're looking at a $500, $600,000 investment in storage tank. John Eichberger: Why would I do that? They're looking at what do I do about ESG? Because they're starting to get pressure on that too, from all fronts. How do I promote my environmental footprint? Biofuels is on the table. But you also have to keep in mind, we've made great progress in the equipment compatibility profile, the market, there are still some compatibility challenges with higher blends that we need to overcome. John Eichberger: They can be overcome, but we just have to be aware of it, and we have to make sure that we are communicating correctly so we can get these fuels to market in a responsible way. They're really concerned and about the future, because everything seems to be changing and all external pressures are trying to take away their primary business. That's why I think the NAX organizations is so focused on providing these options, these opportunities. John Eichberger: Now, I put my other hat on the fuels Institute. We take a look at the research we're doing. We have sorry, several research projects on EV infrastructure. We have a project that's going to be delivered to me today in the first draft, looking at the life cycle assessment comparison between electric vehicles, combustion engines and the fuels in electricity to power them and what are the different dynamics in there so we understand, what we're dealing with in those two. John Eichberger: We just commissioned a new project, looking at the research in R&D on ICE and liquid fuels, looking at the carbon intensity of biofuels and what policies could help support the capitalization on that carbon-intense benefit. I'm working on a project right now where I collected data from more than 2000 retail stations on their ethanol fuel sales. I've got daily sales data over 12 month period on volume, price and margin for easy E0, E15, E10 unleaded, E85, and we're doing a comparison analysis to understand the business structure there. John Eichberger: We've got a couple of other projects ongoing as well, because we're trying to figure out what are the options. The Fuels Institute is looking at this from a, what are the big levers affecting the market and what is not really understood and how can we deliver value to help improve the understanding of those sectors? It really is all over the place, but almost everything is centering around this. How does this march towards lower carbon affect the market and ultimately how does it affect consumers? Because we keep missing that in the national dialogue, what's the impact on consumers and the diehard advocates go, cost is irrelevant. No cost is not irrelevant. Cost is 100% relevant. It has to be part of the equation and we need to continue talking about it. Jon Doggett: And between the apartment I rent here in Chesterfield and the office, there's probably five convenience stores, I've stopped at, at least four out of the five, and yeah, it's lots of gas pumps. Yeah, I go in to get a candy bar or whatever, and if that market changes that much, what happens to those stores? What happens to the people that work there? What happens to the person that delivers the candy bar that I bought? Where are they going to deliver that? We're talking about some really major shifts and just there is a huge, huge dislocation coming if we don't do this, right. John Eichberger: From the ivory tower capital cities is very easy to say, the number one issue we have is to mitigate climate change, and maybe it is. The reality though, is we have to be paying attention to the human element. How do the policies being considered and contemplated affect families? I'm not talking about families along shorelines, talking about [inaudible 00:34:40] families in all markets and all geographic areas who will likely be affected by a dramatic shift in the market, whether it be more difficult for them to get to and fro because transportation is not as reliable and as affordable, whether it be a loss of jobs because the businesses that have been built to support the current infrastructure disappear, and maybe they can't transition to the new green economy, the way it's being expected. John Eichberger: Again, none of this stuff is insurmountable, but it seems to be lacking from the public discussion. We need to get back to thinking about people and families in the context of global priorities. They don't have to be mutually exclusive, but they better be connected. And I'm hoping we see a little bit more of that going forward. Well, Dusty Weis: John Doggett, CEO of The National Corn Growers Association, general sentiment is that corn ethanol has taken so many blows lately. How are you feeling about it right now? You bullish, you're bearish? Where are you at? Jon Doggett: Bullish. You take a look at what our good friends in the petroleum industry have done since the first RFS was passed. They've spent hundreds of millions of dollars in Washington, DC, and with PR firms and radio ads and television ads, and you name it, and still have the RFS and a little old corn outfit called the NCGA and a couple of ethanol groups, and a whole lot of folks who picked up the phone and called their members of Congress from the Midwest, we've kept that going. Jon Doggett: We have taken body blows before, we will take body blows again. The thing that often happens is that there are a lot of people on both coasts that fail to understand the importance of this to middle America. It took the plywood off of storefronts in small rural communities when they built the ethanol plant on the edge of town. It built the basis for more corn production and more corn price in a whole lot of communities around the middle part of this country. Jon Doggett: I think policymakers, they look at ethanol as, well it's something for those silly farmers. This thing is an existential issue for a lot of our folks. If the ethanol industry goes away, we are going to lose a generation of farmers. That's not going to happen and we're not going to let it happen. We have to continue to work on this, but we have to work with all sorts of people, and we have to work with the John Eichbergers of the world because they're bringing truth and objectivity and a different perspective to this discussion, and we absolutely have to have that. Jon Doggett: If we don't have that, if we don't embrace that we are not going to be successful, but I am very encouraged. I hope that this conversation has eased some of the many, many worries that our stakeholders in the corn industry have about this. This business is always growing, always evolving, new players come and players go, but the fact remains corn ethanol is a tool that's available today. It's ready to benefit the environment right now, and that's not going to change anytime soon. Jon Doggett: John Eichberger, executive director of The Fuels Institute, thanks so much for joining us today for this discussion. I'm John Doggett, I'm the CEO of The National Corn Growers Association, and we hope you will join us again soon for the next episode of Wherever Jon May Roam, The National Corn Growers Association podcast.

    "content": "This week, National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) Market Development Manager Michael Granché attended the Chicken Marketing Summit, hosted by the National Chicken Council in Fernandina Beach, Fla. Participants covered a wide array of topics spanning animal protein demand to trade outlook reports and from sustainable poultry production to a panel discussion on broiler welfare; all while defining opportunities for post-pandemic success. “As more organizations and sectors within the agriculture industry continue to set their focus on developing sustainability goals, it becomes increasingly more important to cultivate and lean into partnerships, so that together we can tackle our sustainability goals successfully while feeding an exponentially growing population. It was great to meet with industry folks again in person and to help tell corn’s story,” said Granché. Through this partnership, NCGA is promoting poultry product exports while reminding organizations that corn is multifaceted. Not only is corn a quality and abundant feed, but DDGS products, including high-protein DDGS for poultry, are optimized feed products that the poultry industry can benefit from. The summit was also an opportunity to remind corporate attendees that corn is competitively positioned as an industrial feedstock to help advance bio-based renewable packaging solutions. As one of the keynotes of the meeting, the U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry & Eggs (US-RSPE) announced that the US-RSPE Sustainability Framework is now open for public comment and discussed how it was built specifically to meet consumer needs to see sustainability reporting from end-to-end of the supply chain. The Framework and its multi-stakeholder development process were designed to specifically tackle the complexities of chicken, turkey and egg organization structures and full supply chains. “It was great to see NCGA represented at the summit and engaging with the poultry sector,” said Ryan Bennett, US-RSPE Executive Director. “We know we must work together across the entire value chain to drive progress and continuously improve our sustainability, and that includes sourcing sustainably grown, high-quality feed for poultry. There is great opportunity for U.S. corn growers and poultry producers to work together to drive progress.”",

On Monday evening, National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) Manager of Market Development Michael Granché joined the Career Roundtable representing jobs in associations, nonprofits and member services. Granché was joined by Ellen Zimmerman, Director of Industry Relations for U.S. Grains Council, and together they spoke to three rounds of college students from across the country, answering their questions, providing advice, and sharing their own agriculture story, including how they began working for associations. “I was involved with AFA as a college student and was actually one of the first three students to attend AFA from Virginia Tech. The experience had such a huge impact on me and definitely helped shape me into who I am today. AFA has a great program, and they’re truly helping equip the next generation of leaders who will help solve the agriculture industry’s challenges ahead. For example, I remember going through AFA Leaders Conference, and during their Opportunity Fair, there wasn’t anyone there representing commodity associations. It’s such an honor to work for a commodity association, especially NCGA, and telling students about the different kinds of jobs, successes, and challenges within associations is very fulfilling, especially if they’re unfamiliar with what we do,” said Granché.",

    "title": "New NCGA Campaign Promotes Environmental Benefits of Ethanol in Washington D.C.",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) launched a new campaign in Washington D.C., outlining the environmental benefits of corn ethanol that can be realized today. The digital campaign is made up of non-skippable video units on streaming services, video on local websites within Washington D.C. and social media marketing on Facebook and Instagram. Additionally, NCGA was the sole sponsor of the latest Agri-Pulse Podcast Deep Dive series on biofuels and sponsored content in Politico. All of these efforts explore not only the environmental benefits of ethanol, but the policy demand needed to ensure the industry is on a level playing field moving forward in the transportation and energy sectors. “It is important for us to have a voice in our nation’s capital where decisions that impact how the ethanol industry operates are made,” said NCGA Ethanol Action Team (ETHAT) Chair and Iowa Farmer Mark Recker. “The timing of these communications efforts comes at a critical time for the industry. We want to be sure our voice is being heard in the D.C. market.” The campaign, also supported by the Ohio Corn Checkoff Board, targets government workers, specifically those in the agriculture department, energy department and other key public policy influencers. During the 2021 Summer Meetings, ETHAT voted to expand the program in the coming months. To learn more about NCGA’s efforts around this campaign and corn ethanol, go to ncga.com/ethanol.",

    "title": "NCGA Expresses Opposition to Anti-Ethanol Legislation",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association strongly opposes a bill that was introduced in the U.S. Senate today, referred to as the “Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimination Act,” which would remove the implied conventional biofuel blending requirement from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), increasing harmful emissions and use of fossil fuels. “This bill is ill conceived and would have a devastating impact on air quality, the diversity of our energy supply, fuel prices and rural economies,” said NCGA president John Linder. “Blending ethanol into the fuel supply is one of the most effective ways to lower carbon emissions to combat climate change and replace the most toxic components of gasoline.” Today’s corn growers sustainably produce more corn on less land with fewer resources than when the RFS was enacted and are committed to further improvements in sustainability. These extraordinary results have been accomplished as food price inflation has decreased as ethanol production has grown. “The RFS has been an incredibly successful policy, thanks to the innovation and contributions of corn farmers,” said Linder. “If you want to understand today’s sustainable corn and ethanol production, you can always ask a farmer for the facts. If Members of Congress want to reduce use of the low carbon renewable fuels that have enabled successful environmental policies, this bill would certainly do it.” Today’s Corn and Ethanol Production Facts Corn production has doubled while primary nutrients per bushel have been cut in half. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data, planted corn acres in 2021 were less than planted acres in 2007, the year the RFS was expanded. Corn production has increased because crop yields have increased from an average of 150 bushels per acre in 2007 to 172 bushels in 2020 (average production in 1980 was only 91 bushels per acre). Through advances in science, technology and precision equipment, growers are focused more than ever on improving resiliency and efficiency. Building on past achievements, U.S. corn growers are committed to further sustainability achievements by 2030. The Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory GREET model shows ethanol’s carbon intensity is 44 to 52% lower than gasoline’s carbon intensity, and Argonne has found that the carbon intensity of corn-based ethanol has declined 23% since 2005. Ethanol displaces the most harmful compounds in gasoline that cause respiratory and cardiovascular harm, according to the American Lung Association. According to EPA data, as ethanol blending increased from one percent to at least 10%, aromatics’ share of gasoline volume dropped from nearly 25% to 19.3%.",

    "title": "NCERC Submits Two Grant Proposals to BETO, Expanding Use of Corn as an Industrial Feedstock",
    "content": "The National Corn to Ethanol Research Center (NCERC), a partner of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), submitted two grant proposals to the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) FY21 Bioenergy Technologies (BETO) Multi-Topic Funding Opportunity Announcement. Both proposals would expand the use of corn as an industrial feedstock. NCGA was integral in getting BETO to clarify corn grain as an acceptable feedstock, meaning that starch-derived sugars, specifically starches from field/feed corn, were clarified as acceptable. The first proposal included NCERC as a Co-PI and was led by Marquis Energy. The purpose of this collaboration is to scale up a conversion method that utilizes corn as a feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel. The work being done at the intermediate scale will be performed at NCERC and brings together additional research centers, including the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and US Navy NAWCWD China Lake, to see through a solution that brings significant opportunity for expanding and repurposing the 16 billion-gallon-per-year corn-to-ethanol infrastructure. The National Corn Growers Association has a vested interest in discovering new uses for corn and has provided a letter of support for this initiative. From renewable plastics to novel chemicals and other energy and liquid fuel applications, corn is competitively positioned as the commercial feedstock of choice thanks to corn’s sustainability, abundance, and affordability. In fact, according to USDA ERS Feed Outlook data, ending stocks for 2020/2021 are around 1,552 million bushels. The second proposal led by NCERC, “Scaling up a Low-Cost Low Energy Cellulosic Sugar Production,” contributed to the validation of a low-cost, energy-efficient conversion method for cellulosic materials- and waste-to-biofuel. The funding of this proposal would bring significant value to companies who are pursuing the conversion of a variety of bio-based feedstocks to a sugar stream which can then be converted to countless biotechnologies, such as biofuels, biochemicals, biomaterials, and bioproducts. Partners on this proposal included leaders from government laboratories, academia, and the private sector, including the Advanced Biofuels and Bioproducts Process Development Unit (ABPDU) and Joint BioEnergy Institute of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories, Idaho National Laboratory, Iowa State University, Northern Illinois University, Aemetis, Recology, Visolis, and Zestbio.

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) thanks bipartisan members of Congress in both the House and Senate for their continued support of corn growers and rural America through the introduction of legislation that would ensure higher blends of ethanol, specifically E15, are available in the marketplace year-round. Led by Representatives Angie Craig (D-Minn.), Adrian Smith (R-Neb.) and co-chairs of the House Biofuels Caucus, 22 House members introduced H.R. 4410, the Year-Round Fuel Choice Act. In the Senate, Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), led introduction of the Consumer and Fuel Retailers Choice Act with 10 bipartisan cosponsors. “Corn growers stand behind the many benefits of higher ethanol blends like E15 and support ensuring its continued access to the marketplace on the same terms as standard ten percent blends. E15 is lower in carbon, tailpipe and evaporative emissions, not to mention lower in price, so it’s no surprise oil companies have tried to shut it down through the courts,” said John Linder, National Corn Growers Association President. “NCGA appreciates the bipartisan leadership of Representatives and Senators toward a durable solution that would allow continued market access and expansion for proven low carbon fuel in E15 and stands ready to work with Congress and the EPA to provide certainty for consumers, retailers, our environment and rural economies.” The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a 2019 rule by the Environmental Protection Agency that removed outdated regulatory barriers to the sale of a fifteen percent ethanol fuel blend, E15 or Unleaded 88. The case, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, et al. vs. EPA, was a challenge by oil refiners to the rulemaking that extended the same treatment 10 percent ethanol blends receive to E15, allowing year-round market access for E15. Growth Energy, the Renewable Fuels Association, and the National Corn Growers Association joined the litigation as intervenors in support of EPA’s rule of EPA. NCGA will continue to pursue all options to prevent impact on retailers and drivers this summer and to ensure a long-term solution before next summer.

The President’s Award is given annually at NCGA’s Corn Congress summer meeting to a leader who has worked to advance issues important to corn growers and agriculture. “Congresswoman Bustos has worked tirelessly during her tenure in Congress to represent agriculture, rural America and corn farmers through her advocacy for low-carbon ethanol, support for inland waterway infrastructure essential for moving our crop to export markets and ensuring a role for rural areas when it comes to addressing climate change,” said Linder. “It is an honor to present Representative Bustos with this year’s NCGA President’s Award. We thank her for being an agriculture champion in Congress. In a video to Corn Congress delegates and attendees, Bustos discussed her passion for agriculture, the environmental and economic benefits of corn ethanol and the importance of the Next Generation Fuels Act, which she introduced in the previous session of Congress and is working to reintroduce soon. “As someone who comes from a long line of farmers and represents nearly 10,000 family farms in the Congressional District I serve, this distinction not only means a great deal to me professionally, but personally as well,” said Congresswoman Bustos, Chair of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management. “Ever since I joined the House Agriculture Committee in 2013, the National Corn Growers Association has been a valued partner in advancing the issues important to our growers and producers. I am so grateful for their partnership and cannot thank them enough for this tremendous honor.” Bustos is a senior member of the House Agriculture Committee, where she chairs the Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management that oversees crop insurance and commodity policy. She also served on the bipartisan and bicameral Conference Committee that lead to the successful passage of the 2018 Farm Bill. The Congresswoman is also a member of the House Appropriations Committee, where she serves on three subcommittees, Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs.

    "title": "Why Illinois Choice of a State Microbe Matters to the Nations Farmers",
    "content": "The State of Illinois recently introduced legislation to name a state microbe—Penicillium ruben. This fungus, with its humble beginnings -- first isolated from a rotting cantaloupe at a Peoria, Illinois farmers market--has saved countless lives. History tends to repeat itself. Just as we have seen amazing advances in vaccine development this year, penicillin represented a sea change in human health and disease treatment. Prior to the widespread availability of penicillin, even a small cut could mean death or disfigurement. So, when Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, it was clear that it could be an essential tool to save lives. However, it wasn’t until the 1940s that production was successfully scaled up to help the allies in WWII. The USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) lab in Peoria was the key to scaling up penicillin, and in doing so, saved millions of lives. In addition to penicillin, the Peoria Lab has made several impressive advances, including xanthan gum, corn syrup, and amylose inclusion complexes, a past winner of NCGA’s Consider Corn Challenge. Today, the Peoria Lab and the USDA ARS continue their important work to advance agriculture, create new opportunities for growers, and improve and expand choices for consumers. Numerous technologies show great promise in the early research stages. However, for these projects to reach their full potential benefit to society, they must be scaled up to commercial production levels. Access to facilities possessing the necessary equipment and experience for successful scale-up continues to be of great importance to corn farmers. The USDA ARS system is a unique and tested resource for accomplishing this difficult work. Given the importance of agricultural research and development, NCGA is pleased with President Biden’s proposed USDA ARS budget. NCGA will continue to work with the USDA and other agencies to ensure they receive the funding necessary to drive continued value back to U.S. corn farmers.",

    "title": "Nourish the Future Brings STEM Synergy to St. Louis",
    "content": "Nourish the Future (NTF) had two St. Louis events happening in tandem during the week of June 21. The first was a three-day Teacher Leader Conference that brought together the selected educators for NTF’s Community Class II. During that time, the group participated in peer teaching, curriculum writing and networking as well as an industry dinner at Jungermann Farms in Troy, Missouri, and a presentation and tour at the Melvin Price Locks and Dam in Alton, Illinois. “This opportunity allowed me to bolster my science knowledge and also make some amazing connections with educators I know I can call up,” said Bernadette Harwood, who teaches at Cornell Cooperative Extension of Livingston County in New York. Harwood is an Agriculture in the Classroom teacher, and her job is to push into the pre-K through 12th grade classroom to teach students the science behind the food we eat. Through her experience at the conference, she states that “I now have that knowledge to go home and say [to other teachers], ‘You’re teaching this in your curriculum, and this is how it applies. Let me also help you make some industry connections to our local farmers that are using this technology.’” And while the second cohort of teacher leaders was wrapping up their final day together, a group of middle and high school science teachers participated in a one-day community workshop, “Nourish the Future: Feeding and Fueling the World.” The participants explored water quality, biodiversity, soil health, and sustainability through hands-on activities and free supplies that they could take back to their classrooms. Speaking to the workshop participants, NCGA Director of Research and Productivity Robyn Allscheid said, “This workshop gives you a taste of the Nourish the Future curriculum, and hopefully, it might inspire you to apply as a 2022 teacher leader. Our corn growers are interested in investing in education and know that the talented and passionate teachers involved in this program can make a difference in whether or not students feel inspired to consider a career path in agriculture.” Nourish the Future is made possible through the assistance of the National Corn Growers Association, the nation’s corn farmers, and their state corn checkoff programs.

The 15 attendees, who learn invaluable skills through this retreat to help them make an impact on not only the agricultural industry but also in their other endeavors as well. Noteworthy industry leaders shared their personal leadership experiences and insights gained, including CEO of U.S. Dairy Export Council and former Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Krysta Harden, Syngenta Industry Relations Manager Macie O’Shaughnessy and Bayer President of North America Crop Science Jackie Applegate. Experts led professional development sessions on Quieting our Inner Critic and Making Mentorship Work for You with separate breakout groups for mentees and mentors. The Women and Mentors Retreat allowed the attendees to network and be supported by other female industry leaders to inspire and empower them. This conference also helped the attendees, who met virtually for three sessions prior to last week, gain a network of individuals invested in seeing more women in leadership roles within agriculture, and to become a mentor or a mentee at the conclusion of the conference. The group will continue the program with quarterly virtual calls on leadership topics, and plan to continue with an in-person session annually, increasing the size of this network as we encourage up-and-coming female leaders to take the next steps in their leadership journeys. Those in attendance at the event were Debbie Borg (Neb.); Danie Brandl (Neb.)

    "title": "GROWTH ENERGY, RFA, NCGA DISAGREE WITH COURT DECISION TO REVERSE E15 YEAR-ROUND",
    "content": "The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 2019 rule by the Environmental Protection Agency that lifted outdated restrictions on the sale of a fifteen percent ethanol fuel blend (E15). The case, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, et al. vs. EPA, was a challenge by oil refiners to the rulemaking that allowed the year-round sale of E15. Growth Energy, the Renewable Fuels Association, and the National Corn Growers Association were intervenors on behalf of EPA in the case and issued a joint statement expressing disappointment in the court’s ruling: “We disagree with the court’s decision to reject EPA’s move to expand the RVP waiver to include E15, a decision that could deprive American drivers of lower carbon options at the pump and would result in more carbon in the atmosphere. “We are working to ensure the continuity of E15 sales through the 2021 summer season and beyond. This decision could impact summertime sales across all non-RFG areas where nearly two-thirds of retail sites offering E15 currently do business. If E15 in those markets were to end, summertime E15 sales would fall by 90%. “We are pursuing all available options and will work with the administration and our congressional champions to ensure that we have a solution in place before the 2022 driving season.” Background: In June 2019, EPA issued its final rule extending the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) volatility waiver to E15, and found that E15 is substantially similar to E10 certification fuel, allowing its introduction into commerce by fuel manufacturers without the need for a separate E15 waiver. These actions allowed for the sale of E15 fuels year-round. Oil refiners soon challenged the rulemaking in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in an attempt to undermine the expansion of biofuels in our nation’s fuel supply. On August 21, 2020, Growth Energy, RFA, and NCGA filed a brief as intervenors in the oil industry’s lawsuit against EPA’s regulation allowing year-round E15. The brief provided strong support for EPA’s position that parity in RVP regulations for E10 and E15 is consistent with the provisions of the Clean Air Act and the congressional intent behind those provisions. The organizations further pointed out that extending the volatility waiver from E10 to E15 is appropriate because the volatility of the fuel actually decreases as more ethanol is added into gasoline beyond E10. Growth Energy, RFA, and NCGA participated in oral arguments for the case on April 13, 2021.",

    "title": "NCGA Supports Biofuel Infrastructure Legislation",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association thanks Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and bipartisan co-sponsors for the introduction of three new bills that would help expand the use of higher ethanol blends in the marketplace and thanks bipartisan House members for introducing and supporting similar legislation. “The three pieces of legislation introduced by Senators Klobuchar, Ernst and Thune offer pathways to include biofuels in ongoing congressional discussions over an infrastructure package and clean energy incentives,” said NCGA Director of Public Policy and Renewable Fuels Kathy Bergren. “Ethanol’s low carbon and environmental benefits should be recognized and utilized in any infrastructure package. Getting higher blends of ethanol into the marketplace and more vehicles on the road that can use those higher blends further reduces greenhouse gas emissions, provides consumers more options, and gives farmers a stable market for their sustainable corn crop.” The Biofuel Infrastructure and Agricultural Product Market Expansion Act, S. 2271 co-sponsored by Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), would authorize a higher biofuel blends infrastructure grant program through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The bill increases the funding authorization and duration of the grant program. The Clean Vehicles Act, S. 2267, also cosponsored by Senator Ernst, would establish a $200 per vehicle refundable tax credit for manufacturers for the production of flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs), as well as re-establish CAFE/GHG credits for FFVs. The credit would sunset after 10 years. The Low Carbon Biofuels Credit Act, S. 2262 co-sponsored by Senator John Thune (R-S.D.), would establish a 5 cent per gallon tax credit for sales of 15% ethanol blends and a 10 cent per gallon tax credit for sales of blends greater than 15%. The credit would be fully refundable. On the House side, Representatives Cindy Axne (D-Iowa) and Adrian Smith (R-Neb.) also introduced the Low Carbon Biofuels Credit Act yesterday, as H.R. 5254. House legislation to authorize a higher biofuel blends infrastructure grant program at USDA was introduced earlier this year. Led by Representatives Axne and Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), the House biofuels infrastructure bill, H.R. 1542, now has 18 bipartisan co-sponsors.

    "title": "Be an Informed Voter! Meet the FY22 Corn Board Candidates",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association will elect farmer leaders to fill positions on the NCGA Corn Board during Corn Congress on Wednesday, July 14 in New Orleans, Louisiana. The NCGA Corn Board represents the organization on all matters while directing both policy and supervising day-to-day operations. Board members serve the organization in a variety of ways. They represent the federation of state organizations, supervise the affairs and activities of NCGA in partnership with the chief executive officer and implement NCGA policy established by the Corn Congress. Members also act as spokespeople for the NCGA and enhance the organization’s public standing on all organizational and policy issues. Meet the Candidates Randy DeSutter DeSutter operates a grain farm in its fourth generation along with his son Matthew, brother Jim and nephew Drew. Having operated continuously using no-till for nearly 30 years, they also use conservation practices such as filter strips, grassed waterways, variable rate fertilizer and cover crops. For the first 15 years of his farming career, he also finished cattle and hogs. A problem solver with a passion for agriculture, Randy hopes to find solutions to the challenges facing the corn industry at home and abroad. If elected, Randy would work to help the corn industry thrive and prosper. He believes NCGA needs to be out front on the issues important to us instead of playing defense. With growing corn demand paramount, Randy advocates a multipronged approach of increasing ethanol use, trade, corn fed to livestock and finding new uses. Additionally, he would place a high value upon work to ensure a safety net in tough times through the farm bill and preventing burdensome regulations. Dave Drennan Drennan owns 510 acres of farmland in Calhoun County, Iowa, which he crop shares for corn and soybeans. Having gained a wealth of experience through an extensive career in agriculture and as an owner of farmland, Dave is running for the NCGA Corn Board to restore the Renewable Fuel Standard's integrity and expand NCGA’s reach legislatively and across the country. If elected, Dave would work to expand grassroots involvement, build new alliances and increase support of the organization’s goals. Placing the highest importance on honesty and integrity, he would listen and involve parties while being proactive and receptive to new ideas. Deb Gangwish Gangwish raises corn, seed corn and soybeans on a fully irrigated farm in central and north-central Nebraska with her husband Paul, son Trace, son-in-law Dalton, and a great team of a few dozen employees. In addition to traditional farming and ranching activities, she and her family run a custom harvest seed operation and a small trucking company. A current member of the Corn Board, Gangwish holds the chance to give back to an organization that has given our nation’s corn farmers so much as an honor. Knowing she sees NCGA as an integral advocate for the industry, she wants to serve and contribute. As a Corn Board member, she strives to represent all U.S. corn farmers' greater good with a grit inspired by an empathetic connection to her fellow farmers. Gangwish brings determination coupled with a focus on consensus building to her service. She will continue prioritizing driving demand, which she explains through the metaphor of an intertwined strand of steel. To be successful, we must weave together work in areas such as ethanol, trade, new uses, policy, consumer engagement, research and sustainability, to form a strong, enduring structure on which to build a future for our families and farms. Jim Greif Greif grows 1,000 acres of corn and soybeans in eastern Iowa. Along with his wife, Sharon, he also runs a retail business specializing in seed and chemicals with custom spraying, fertilizer application and aerial application. In addition, he e has been a certified crop advisor for more than 25 years. Jim and Sharon have three grown children with college degrees and who work in the ag industry. Having gained experience on local and state government boards, he maintains good relationships with both parties' politicians at all levels of government. This can be attributed to working with a broad range of people to bring them together. If elected, Jim would place grinding more corn as his highest priority. He believes it is important for U.S. corn farmers to maintain their status as reliable suppliers of quality corn on the world market. Jim also places importance on continuing to push the message that ethanol is the most sustainable, renewable, clean fuel available. That being said, he thinks that it is vital NCGA continues to look for the next big thing, such as MEG and ethanol fuel cells. Bob Hemesath Hemesath raises 2,900 acres of corn and runs a 40,000 head hog wean-to-finish and feeder-to-finish along with his brother, nephew, and in busy seasons, his father in Iowa. Bob wants to help move NCGA’s portfolio of issues and programs forward to build a positive future for farmers. Drawing upon his passion for both NCGA and the Iowa Corn Growers Association, his service is motivated by a desire to help the entire industry remain strong for the benefit of all members. By working collaboratively and utilizing the problem-solving skills he has honed through years of leadership experience, he aims to balance the specific needs of members with the broader perspective of factors influencing the industry to achieve the best possible future outcomes. If elected, Bob would ensure NCGA works to expand uses of corn and build new markets while protecting those that already exist. Furthermore, he would protect policies in place and advocate for more that protect farmers’ ability to grow their crops. Dan Wesely Wesely farms both corn and soybeans, working with his neighbor in eastern Nebraska. As neighbors, they found themselves in the same places with the declining health of their fathers. Thus, they found ways to work together and independently using modern technology. Their operation is 75 percent irrigated. Both open-minded and collaborative, he prioritizes listening to the grassroots, building relationships and remaining calm in the face of every challenge. As a board member, Dan will work to maintain and build new relationships in Washington. He sees maintaining and growing markets, both at home and abroad, as key. To accomplish these goals, he believes in the importance of farmers’ telling their own stories. Harold Wolle, Jr. Wolle transitioned his farm to his son, Matt, who rents the tillable ground of his 1,700 acres. On this ground, Matt raises corn and soybeans. Harold also has 200 acres that are enrolled in the CRP program. As a current Corn Board member, he uses his 40-plus years of leadership experience, along with his formal education in business administration, to advance NCGA’s strategic priorities. If re-elected, Harold would continue working collaboratively with fellow Corn Board members to increase demand for corn, strengthen customer and consumer trust, and enhance productivity and sustainability. By placing a high value upon direct, constructive communications, he would work to ensure all the voices around the table are heard as the Board works to achieve consensus on important issues.",

    "title": "Biofuels Coalition Disappointed in Supreme Court Decision to Overturn Tenth Circuits RFS Refinery Exemption Ruling",
    "content": "A coalition of renewable fuel and farm groups expressed “extreme disappointment” in today’s U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning a 2020 appellate court ruling that struck down three improper small refinery exemptions granted by previous EPA administrators. However, because certain elements of the appellate court ruling were left unchallenged and were not reviewed by the Supreme Court, the groups remain optimistic that the Biden administration will discontinue the past administration’s flagrant abuse of the refinery exemption program. Today’s decision stems from a May 2018 challenge brought against EPA in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit by the Renewable Fuels Association, the National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, and the American Coalition for Ethanol, working together as the Biofuels Coalition. The petitioners argued that the small refinery exemptions were granted in direct contradiction to the statutory text and purpose of the RFS. In January 2020, the Tenth Circuit decided that EPA cannot “extend” exemptions to any small refineries whose earlier, temporary exemptions had lapsed. According to the Circuit Court ruling, “the statute limits exemptions to situations involving ‘extensions,’ with the goal of forcing the market to accept escalating amounts of renewable fuels over time.” While the Supreme Court failed to affirm this portion of the Tenth Circuit decision, the Biofuels Coalition pointed out that the appellate court also ruled that EPA’s exemption decisions must reconcile the agency’s consistent findings that all refineries recover the costs of compliance with the RFS, and that EPA may only use hardship caused by the RFS to justify granting exemptions. Despite today’s Supreme Court decision, EPA must still resolve those other aspects of the Tenth Circuit ruling. “Nearly a year and a half ago, the Tenth Circuit handed down a unanimous decision that was ultimately adopted by the very agency we took to court in the first place,” coalition members said. “While we are extremely disappointed in this unfortunate decision from the Supreme Court, we will not stop fighting for America’s farmers and renewable fuel producers. Further, we are optimistic that other elements of the Tenth Circuit decision, which were not reviewed by the Supreme Court, will compel the Biden administration and EPA’s new leadership to take a far more judicious and responsible approach to the refinery exemption program than their predecessors did.” Irrespective of today’s decision, the Biofuels Coalition thanked President Biden and EPA Administrator Regan for taking swift action to rein in the previous administration’s mismanagement of the small refinery exemption program. After carefully reviewing the issue, new EPA leadership in February reversed the agency’s previous position and announced support for the Tenth Circuit decision. In April, EPA decided to revoke three last-minute refinery exemptions granted the day before President Biden’s inauguration; and in May, EPA announced it would cooperate with a Government Accountability Office investigation into the past administration’s adjudication of small refinery exemptions. As of today, 70 small refinery exemption petitions remain pending with EPA, for the compliance years 2011-2020.",

    "content": "A new report commissioned by the National Corn Growers Association’s (NCGA) Risk Management & Transportation Action Team (RMTAT) with KCOE-Isom dives into potential changes in capital gains federal taxation and step-up in basis for corn farmers. “Having an understanding of the tax proposals, the potential impacts on farms, and what it would take for a change to be made legislatively is why RMTAT worked with KCOE Isom on this report,” said RMTAT Chair and South Dakota farmer Doug Noem. “We will continue to analyze and review the proposals from President Biden that if enacted would include a significant change from the historical treatment of income tax basis.” The report is broken into seven sections, including the impact on agriculture with case study examples, an explanation of the administration’s proposal, and a history of step up in basis. A key finding and explanation within the report states: “The recently-issued administrative revenue proposal outlines significant change from the historical treatment of income tax basis by transfer through an estate or lifetime gift. The proposal now includes these transfers as “realization events” and imposes capital gains tax on any appreciation of those assets that cumulatively exceed $1 million per taxpayer through lifetime gifts and transfers at death, indexed for inflation after 2022. Any unused lifetime exclusion is “portable” to a surviving spouse, consistent with the existing estate and gift tax portability rules.” You can read the full report here. Other NCGA Farm Policy Tax Action: NCGA recently held an informational tax webinar for corn growers with KCOE Isom regarding News and Perspective on Tax Planning and Priorities. Additionally, after a conversation that U.S. House Agriculture Committee Chairman David Scott (D-Ga.) had with the Corn Board in May, he sent a letter to President Biden expressing his concerns to proposed changes in tax policy that would eliminate the stepped-up basis provisions used by farmers. In May, NCGA joined 40 agricultural organizations in a letter to congressional leaders outlining key tax priorities, including protecting current estate tax exemptions and preserving the step-up in basis for capital gains.

    "title": "NCGA Thanks Members of Congress for Calling on the Administration to Uphold the RFS",
    "content": "Last week, agriculture and biofuels leaders in both the House and Senate stood up for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in a series of letters and on the Senate floor, advocating for the Biden Administration to set strong 2021 and 2022 RFS volumes and opposing options to waive or exempt refiners from the RFS. Senate and House Democrats sent a letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan and National Economic Council Director Brain Deese on Wednesday saying, “As your Administration continues to push for meaningful and rapid climate action, biofuels can and should play an important role in decarbonizing vehicle emissions. Recent studies demonstrate that using ethanol in place of gasoline reduces greenhouse gas emissions by almost half, while biodiesel cuts greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 74 percent. Exempting refiners of their obligations to blend biofuel would mean increased reliance on oil and more carbon emissions – a result this country cannot afford if we are to meet our new commitment under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions by 50 – 52 percent by 2030.” Signers included Senators Amy Klobuchar (MN), Tammy Duckworth (IL), Dick Durbin (IL), Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (MI), Tammy Baldwin (WI), and Tina Smith (MN) and Representatives Cindy Axne (IA-03), Cheri Bustos (IL-17), Angie Craig (MN-01), Ron Kind (WI-03), Mark Pocan (WI-02), House Agriculture Committee Chairman David Scott (GA-13), Lauren Underwood (IL-14), Raja Krishnamoorthi (IL-08) and Ruben Gallego (AZ-7). A group of House Biofuels Caucus members sent a letter Friday saying, “The RFS has been a tremendous success, providing a critical value-added market for our farmers, lowering the price of fuel for consumers, and improving air quality across the nation. The past efforts to undermine the RFS with SREs, tepid annual volume requirements, and lack of support amid the COVID-19 pandemic left the biofuels industry uncertain on several fronts. Undercutting the RFS will undermine its future potential and impose additional uncertainty for our local farmers and biofuels producers.” Signers included Rodney Davis (IL-13), Adrian Smith (NE-3), Dusty Johnson (SD), Randy Feenstra (IA-4), Michelle Fischbach (MN-7), Jim Hagedorn (MN-1), Darin LaHood (IL-18), Donald J. Bacon (NE-2), Ann Wagner (MO-2), Tom Emmer (MN-6), Blaine Luetkemeyer (MO-3), Mike Bost (IL-12), Ashley Hinson (IA-1), Mariannette Miller-Meeks, M.D. (IA-2), Vicky Hartzler (MO-4), Adam Kinzinger (IL-16), Jeff Fortenberry (NE-1), Sam Graves (MO-6), Tracey Mann (KS-1), and James R. Baird (IN-4). Iowa Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley also weighed in with U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, and Senator Grassley also discussed the issue on the Senate floor last Tuesday. You can read the group letters here and here. Finally, NCGA joined other agriculture and biofuels organizations in a letter to EPA Administrator Regan and NEC Director Deese in support of RFS integrity.",

    "title": "Butterflies and Beetles and Bees, Oh My!",
    "content": "Today is the official kickoff of Pollinator Week, which runs Monday, June 21 through Sunday, June 27 this year. Fourteen years ago, the U.S. Senate approved the designation of a “National Pollinator Week” to help bring to light the issue of declining pollinator populations. It has now grown into a worldwide celebration of all pollinators--bees, birds, butterflies, bats, beetles and small mammals, just to name a few! NCGA is proud to support pollinator health awareness through initiatives like the Bee and Butterfly Habitat Fund, the Honeybee Health Coalition and Farmers for Monarchs. These programs offer online tools, educational resources, and best management practices to help support pollinator habitats. By incorporating pollinator forage and creating a pollinator-friendly landscape in tandem with their crop lands, growers can protect soil health, improve water quality by controlling runoff and sediment, and capture carbon in the environment. The next step in a good stewardship plan is using pollinator-friendly pest management practices. Programs like BeSure! from Growing Matters provide free guides and other resources to optimize the use of pesticide products to protect both crops and nearby pollinators. With approximately 90 million acres of corn planted each year across a wide range of geographies, farmers have an important role in supporting pollinators and their habitats. Around 75% - 95% of all flowering plant species need pollinators for reproduction. In turn, pollinators provide their services to 180,000 different plant species and more than 1,200 crops. That translates to one out of every three bites of food being eaten are provided by our pollinators! “Protecting pollinators is just one of the many ways corn growers help create and maintain a healthy and sustainable farming operation,” said Illinois corn grower and Production Technology Access Action Team Chair Kate Danner. “As a farmer, I take my role as a steward of the land very seriously. I know that our growers are committed to a legacy of conservation and sustainability.” Pollinators contribute to ecosystem health and a sustainable food supply. And how better to show pollinators that you thank them than with flowering forage habitats and pesticide stewardship! Visit ncga.com/pollinators to learn more!

    "content": "Today, at the Farm Futures Business Summit in Iowa, both corn farmers and ethanol industry leaders shed light on the future of ethanol. The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) sponsored the panel with Iowa corn farmer and NCGA Ethanol Action Team (ETHAT) member Kelly Nieuwenhuis, Renewable Fuels Association CEO Geoff Cooper, and Growth Energy Senior Vice President Mike Lorenz. RFA CEO Geoff Cooper kicked off the panel discussion, outlining the landscape of the industry, noting that ethanol is a renewable, high-octane, hydrogen-rich low-carbon molecule with an incredibly bright future. “We have a lot of room to grow in the world market,” Cooper stated. “Corn ethanol’s average reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline is 46%. No other fuel at the same scale can make that claim.” Growth Energy SVP of Market Development Mike Lorenz, who spent 20 years with Sheetz, discussed the expansion of higher blends of ethanol, like E15. “The future of ethanol is now,” Lorenz told the crowd. “Liquid fuels will play an important role in the fleet moving forward, and ethanol plays a key role in decarbonizing our transportation pool.” NCGA ETHAT member Kelly Nieuwenhuis wrapped up the discussion talking about the importance of the ethanol industry to corn farmers and why he’s optimistic about the future of biofuels. “We’re working on a lot of great initiatives with our partners in the ethanol industry that people should be excited about,” Nieuwenhuis said. “Our work on pump infrastructure with Wayne Fueling Systems, engine testing at the University of California at Riverside with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to show the environmental benefits and compatibility of E15, and work on the Next Generation Fuels Act are just a few of the things we’re working on to grow the ethanol market.” The event was a hybrid event with more than 200 farmers in attendance.",

    "title": "EP.21-Leading the Field in Sustainability, with Nebraska Corn Grower Brandon Hunnicutt",
    "content": "NCGA charts a course on the future of U.S. corn sustainability for continued improvement, increased marketability and a better future. In today’s world, farmers face growing consumer expectations, a need for economic resilience and the very real pressures of global climate change. And they’re meeting these challenges head-on with science-driven practices that prove that sustainability is more than a buzzword in the agriculture industry. In this episode, Nebraska farmer and NCGA board member Brandon Hunnicutt outlines NCGA’s new sustainability goals, and the benefits he’s seen from thinking about the sustainability of his own operation. He shares his personal insights about smart farming advances, cover crop use, advanced irrigation management and other techniques that make his farm more sustainable, and how he’s saved money and improved yields as a result. Plus, Jon offers up the view from Washington, and why it’s important for growers to be perceived as part of the solution in the ongoing discussion over sustainability. To learn more about NCGA’s 2030 sustainability goals, and to offer your feedback, visit ncga.com/sustainability. Direct Share Transcript Brandon Hunnicutt: When we start talking sustainability, it's a long-term resiliency. It's making sure that as we look at adding cover crops, are we able to reduce our herbicide usage? Are we able to reduce our nitrogen usage? Which we have been able to do, and so we're able to save money, we're able to change up our practices. And ultimately, that gives us more dollars to work within the long term. Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, The National Crow Growers Association Podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host, association CEO Jon Doggett. From the fields of the corn belt to the DC beltway, we're making sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: In today's world, farmers face growing consumer expectations, a need for economic resilience, and the very real pressures of global climate change. And they're meeting these challenges head-on with science-driven practices that prove that sustainability is more than a buzzword in the agriculture industry. In this episode, Nebraska farmer and NCGA board member, Brandon Hunnicutt outlines NCGA's new sustainability goals and the benefits that he's seen from putting some of these practices to work in his own operation. Dusty Weis: But if you haven't yet, make sure that you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also make sure that you follow the NCGA on Twitter @nationalcorn, and sign up for The National Crow Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. And with that, it's time to once again introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of The National Crow Growers Association. And Jon, agriculture has always been really cool to me because of the way that it ties together the macro and the micro; what happens in one farm field has an impact in the world outside that field and vice versa. As we continue to build on the science of agriculture, we're really able to do some incredible things that change the whole world. Jon Doggett: Certainly. It is amazing to me the embrace that farmers have had towards sustainability in the last number of years. I've heard it in Washington for 30 plus years, but I'm hearing a lot of growers talk about sustainability, and they're proud of their sustainable record that they have in producing food and fiber for a world that needs it. So it's not a buzzword anymore, it's part of our everyday life. It's being able to document and prove that farmers are constantly improving things on their farms. And the efficiencies and how they handle things, it's much different. And our vice-president, Chris Edgington often says, \"If you haven't been on a corn farm in five years, you haven't been on a corn farm.\" I think that's important for us to remember because this is an industry that is constantly improving. Jon Doggett: So one of the things that we wanted to do is, just recently we released our first sustainability report and 2030 sustainability goals. And so today we're going to discuss why we decided to adopt those goals, how we went about setting them, and then most importantly, what's next for corn's sustainability story. So today we're joined by Brandon Hunnicutt. He is a farmer from Giltner, Nebraska, and he is on the NCGA board of directors. Brandon's also the chair of the Field to Market Organization. He's the first farmer to ever hold that position. And he and that organization have done great work in documenting the sustainability improvements of corn and other crops over time. So we're going to talk more about that in a little while. But a really good place to start this conversation is to introduce Brandon Hunnicutt. Jon Doggett: Brandon, thank you so much for being on the podcast. We very much appreciate you being with us. Brandon Hunnicutt: Thank you very much. It's great to be here. Great honor. And enjoying the conversation. Jon Doggett: So Brandon, tell us about your farm and where is it in Nebraska, what do you raise and how long has your family been on that farm? Brandon Hunnicutt: So as was mentioned earlier, I'm from Giltner Nebraska. It's about an hour west of Lincoln, just sort of in the south central part of the state and farm here with my brother and my father. And we raise corn, soybeans, popcorn, we dabble in some seed corn. We also have a little bit in organic production. Everything's completely irrigated, it's 2,400 acres. And between my brother and I, we have 11 kids. So I guess we technically count our kids as head... Dusty Weis: You're not short on farm hands is what I'm hearing. Brandon Hunnicutt: No, the running joke was we're going to get into organic production because of all our kids. And lo and behold, we did. So that's a little bit about our operation and we're always trying different, innovative things, whether it's from a technology standpoint, the next wave of biologicals, or grain robots, or whatever might be coming down the line. Jon Doggett: So Brandon, it's such an integral part of the way the world does business today around that sustainability platform and space. Our customers are constantly saying, \"Hey, this is important to us.\" So that's an expectation we have, making sustainability a priority. Talk about where you come to this discussion and this issue, from the perspective of a farmer in south central, Nebraska. Brandon Hunnicutt: The sustainability conversation, you think back a number of years, and we weren't really talking about it in the terms of sustainability. It was just, What can we do different on the farm? What is it that is going to make a difference farming wise? And I got thinking about from all the way to the concept of GMO crops. And we don't think about that from a sustainability aspect, but that was really the groundwork that was laid for most farmers, I think, is that, How can we become more sustainable in our own operations by reducing inputs, whatever those inputs are? Then came along the wave of auto-steer technology. And we were able to do more aggressive type of practices. It's, Well, we're going to strip-till, we're going to do this. And it all just kind of started to fit together on the farm. Brandon Hunnicutt: And then on our own farm, we started looking at it from an irrigation standpoint. We're fully irrigated, we pump out the Ogallala Aquifer. We also know that's not an infinite resource. We need to be able to protect it for the term, not just for ourselves, but for the future generations. And so we started working on different technologies that we could use on the farm that we could say, Okay, how much water does the crop actually need? I know I've got all the charts. I did crop consulting. I know what it says, the crop should be using for water, but does that match up to what the sensors say? So we reduced our footprint on water by just adding some sensors to the field. Brandon Hunnicutt: And so as we looked at this from a sustainability standpoint, they just sort of stacked one on top of another. And then we got to being able to introduce cover crops, and different pathways, and being able to measure that from a data standpoint of, Well we have all this technology, let's see what we can do. And so sometimes we think about it in the here and now, but it's been a 20 year process to get to this point for a lot of farmers. And it's exciting to see. Dusty Weis: What's really interesting about that to me, Brandon, is when you start talking sustainability in the business of agriculture, I know from my experience, a lot of the time, what you hear from the growers is, \"Well, it's such an investment of time and of money and of learning upfront.\" And your experience, it sounds like, is not all about making that investment all at once, but just sort of spreading it out over time and getting a little bit deeper and a little bit deeper into that barrel of new practices. Brandon Hunnicutt: That's a great point. That is the way we've approached it over time is, How can we implement different practices to make it more worthwhile? And sometimes some of the pieces of equipment are pretty expensive. And does that fit in the operation or is there something else we can do? And then how do we overlay that with other operations? Maybe it makes sense to put everything to cover crops, but if you don't have the data to back it up, it maybe makes no sense to do everything. You start in bits and pieces. And no matter what the sustainability practice is, it goes back to research in general, is that most farmers have a little piece of ground they can try sustainability practices on and not worry about affecting the overall bottom line of the farm. They're not going to go broke doing it. And so you start out little and you expand to big. Dusty Weis: Jon, is you had mentioned, this has really become an expectation among corn's key customers here. So from the macro perspective, why is it important to make sustainability a priority, to the point where you guys at the NCGA included this in your market recovery plan? Jon Doggett: Well when we had that market recovery plan, we brought in a representative group of our customers and over and over again, not to anyone's surprise, they talked about sustainability and we talked about sustainability and what we've done and we're going to do with this report. And a lot of other activities is we're going to start melding together the sustainability on the farm, the sustainability of our customers, whether it be in the livestock industry, or the ethanol industry, how do we pull all of this together? So that, that ultimate product that the customer puts in their tank or on their table is something that can legitimately, factually be labeled as being sustainably produced. And we need to be able to have that label to tell consumers, Hey, what went into this product that you're going to put into that grocery cart was something that was grown with a great deal of pride by family farmers across the country who were continuing to do the right thing. Jon Doggett: One of the conversations and I've heard it over and over again is, well, we can't let somebody else define what's sustainable for agriculture. We don't want Walmart or Costco or someone else defining what sustainability is. I want Brandon Hunnicutt to be defining what's sustainable on his farm. I want other growers to define what sustainable on their farms. And we need to have... Be able to trace back and say these folks are doing the right thing. So it's important because if we don't do it, if we're not proactive in pushing our great story forward, someone else is going to tell our story. And they probably won't tell it accurately, factually, and they may not have our best interest at heart when they tell that story. So it's really important for us to tell our story and the great thing about the corn industry is we have a great story to tell. Dusty Weis: Brandon, a little more about your personal story, then on your farm in Nebraska. You touched on a little bit the environmental benefits of the sustainability practices that you've implemented there. And certainly there's a story to be told around that, but I want to hear a little more too, about how these practices have made your operation more economically resilient. Brandon Hunnicutt: Yeah. I think one of the key aspects as we're looking at this from an economic resiliency standpoint, is that it's not a quick fix. I'll go back to my GMO example for a second. Guys could easily figure out that if I spend X amount on this seed, I can reduce my cost of whatever the input is, whether a pesticide, whether a herbicide, you can reduce that down. But when we started talking sustainability, it's a long-term resiliency. It's making sure that as we've looked at adding cover crops, is it, are we able to reduce our herbicide usage? Are we able to reduce our nitrogen usage, which we have been able to do in certain aspects? And then also as we're trying to maintain soil structure and soil integrity, and you throw out a cover crop in there and all of a sudden the soil is holding better together and our water infiltration is better. Brandon Hunnicutt: And so we go back to the irrigation standpoint, is that we've been put on about two to three inches four up to five inches, a year of water. And we compare that to go back to 2012. We only put 10 inches of water on I think, and that was a dry year. And if you compare that to 1988, we probably would've put 30 plus inches on. And a lot of that just came down to these practices we were doing. And so we were able to save money. We're able to change up our practices of how we're doing things. And ultimately that gives us more dollars to work with in the long-term. Jon Doggett: So, Brandon, can you tell us again, that those figures from the nineties to today, how much water you're putting on your cornfield? Can you give us that number again? Brandon Hunnicutt: When we're looking at water usage, I'll start out this way from the sustainability standpoint is as we've irrigated crops in Nebraska, we went from... we talk about using gravity irrigation, so big pipes that put out in precise amounts of water, and you put a lot of water on. So in 1988, a dry year we'd have been putting on upwards of 30 inches just based on what we were doing for our practices. We'll move quickly to 2002 when it was another dry year. And we were still putting on probably more water than we needed to. We started instituting sensor technology, and by 2012, which was extremely dry, just for comparison sake, our dry land pivot corners were yielding zero to five bushels, an acre, but our irrigated corn was still making 220 to 240, and we were only put on 12 inches of water. Fast forward to the last few years where it's been a little wetter and 2019, I think we were in two pivots, maybe for half a circle. And all that was based off of being able to use the technology that's out there and available to help us monitor that, and that's part of the sustainability concept. Jon Doggett: This is the reason we have this podcast. This is the reason we do a lot of these things is to talk about how agriculture exists today. Not about what existed 20, 30, 40 years ago. And I've spent most of my adult life advocating for agriculture. And I always find that when I get most frustrated is when I'm trying to explain that the agriculture people believe is in existence today, hasn't been in existence for decades. And so I think that the story that you tell is such a good one, it just points out again and again and again, what the good things are that you do, Brandon, you also raise popcorn. So unlike your other corn, that's directly consumed by customers. What kind of sustainability requirements are you getting from the people that buy your popcorn? Brandon Hunnicutt: Popcorn is an interesting one because as you mentioned, it is consumer facing, it is the one that does not have GMOs in it. It's this whole different concept. Everybody enjoys it, whether you're at a football game, or a movie, or just hanging out with family around board games. And I think we're starting to see a little bit more of a... Really the look at the sustainability practices. And I'll bring up the example of earlier this year, I was on Amazon looking up for some reason, I looked up preferred popcorn, which is who we grow for. And I realized they had an environmental label on there, which seemed a little bit surprising, but that was because of their packaging purposes. And there's some movement being made within that to put a sustainable type label on there. Brandon Hunnicutt: I think we're just really at the beginning of stages of popcorn of people looking at it. And it's going to be the most obvious one as far as a direct to consumer within the corn industry, outside of the sweet corns of the world. That really, I think people are going to start looking at because they, they know exactly what they're doing and when they're popping it in, they know exactly what they're eating and they're going to want to make sure that it's grown in a way that fits their lifestyles and their key desires. Jon Doggett: I have a five-year-old and a seven year old granddaughter and they both love popcorn and they eat a lot of it. And I can tell you for sure that their mother makes sure that that is good stuff for them to be eating. And I tell them, yes, it probably came from Brandon Hunnicutts farm. Brandon Hunnicutt: And that's one of the interesting things of just what people look at and how much they want to make sure that that product is healthy and safe, and they can feel comfortable eating it. In reality, it is a comfort food. So if you're eating a comfortable comfort food, you're a happier individual. Jon Doggett: So let's transition to the activities that our organization has been engaged in. We've been talking about sustainability for quite some time, but we began a more formal process. In 2019, we established a Corn Sustainability Advisory Group. The goal was to drive our sustainability story, and chart the best way forward for our organization. So the group approved a corn sustainability commitment statement, released about a year ago. Then approved the development of a sustainability report and future sustainability goals. And what I really want to emphasize is that this was put together by farmers. This wasn't a staff-driven thing. This was a farmer-led effort. And while staff played a key role and we brought in outside experts to help define those goals, but really at every step of the process, corn farmers were involved in – made all of the important decisions. And that's what I think is really cool about what we've done, is that we've brought very progressive farmer voices to this discussion and it's been great. And so it culminated with the NCGA Corn Board approving earlier this year, the sustainability goals to reach by 2030. And so, Brandon, you want to talk about what those goals are and how you believe that they came together and why it was important for us to do this. Brandon Hunnicutt: So, I think it's important to think about from NCGA that by 2030 we do have these five sustainability goals and they relate to different areas. The first one being land juice, second one soil erosion, third one irrigation water use efficiency. Fourth is greenhouse gas emissions. And the fifth one is energy use. We were looking at the goal for each of these metrics and they was chosen for several reasons. And it just touch on those, is that I think all those are important, because no matter what area of the United States, you're in no matter where you're growing corn, one of those, if not multiples of those really affect you, and they affect farmers in different ways. And sometimes we get that lost in the conversation that, yeah, what doesn't work in Nebraska, but does it work in Ohio, that's fine. It's about reaching the goals that we've set out for as NCGA. And it's very important to, as an industry, that we reach these going back to the point that, if we don't set these goals and we don't reach these goals, somebody else is going to set them for us. And we know how much heartache and how much that can cause within the corn industry. Jon Doggett: So Brandon Hunnicutt, NCGA board member and farmer from south-central Nebraska. You've been very involved in the field to market organization for quite some time. They've generated a lot of data for the last 10 years, even for the last 40. So field to market brought together stakeholders who represent multiple steps in the value chain. And not only does field to market provide us with a great history of measurement, but those measurements are also recognized by the other people in the room. Why is that important to have that group assembled that way, and have that kind of discussion? Brandon Hunnicutt: Having a group assembled that can talk things out, that can really work on the same end goal, when we're talking sustainability is very important. It allows us to work through those issues that none of the groups might realize if they're just talking amongst themselves. It's the farmers have their ideas, brands and retailers have theirs, civil society has theirs, but when we get together, we can start to map the path forward on what we think agriculture needs to be, what we think these metrics are and how is it that we can come to that point that everybody ultimately wins. And ultimately our goal is to really work on working on a cleaner planet. I mean, that's what we all desire. It doesn't matter if I'm a corn farmer in Nebraska. I want that ground that I'm farming now to be in better shape for my kid then it was when it was first broken out 100 years ago, that's what the goal is. Field to market is they've become that leading platform that people look to, to say okay, what are these metrics? What are we looking at? How can we work together? And how can we bring the key stakeholders together? And it's not a policy institution it's, for lack of a better term, at times it's almost a think tank, but with solid metrics behind it. To show the data and to make sure that we're moving the right way forward. Dusty Weis: And I understand that the data that field to market collects and measures actually help play a role in setting the five sustainability goals that NCGA hopes to reach by 2030. Brandon Hunnicutt: Yeah that is correct what they call the field print calculator. You know, it's the way for farmers to enter data and we're getting more outside data collection centers, being able to tap into that and feed the data into it. So it should become easier and easier for farmers just put in, see what their sustainability scores are, see what changes they might need to make. And we all know we have changes we can always make. It doesn't matter if you're farming or if you're eating, there's something you can always change. And so NCGA was more than happy to tap into that because even as the chair, I still think it's the leading organization, as far as data metrics for sustainability is concerned. Jon Doggett: Brandon I have attended some of the field to market meetings, and it's been a while, but I have been struck in the times that I've gone, generally somebody who's in the consumer-facing part of the industry, they seem surprised when you give them some of the data, you give them some of the metrics, you give them some of the story, they seem to be surprised. What has surprised you as a farmer that you've heard in those rooms that came from the downstream folks. Brandon Hunnicutt: One of the challenges or the things that surprises me is sometimes just the lack of knowledge of what goes on, and that doesn't downplay what they're doing. It just means that, there is this disconnect from what goes on out in the farm to where our product ends up. And if we can find a way to get more people out on the farm, show Hey, this is what we're doing now, that becomes a key player in this. And so that's always the sticking point is just maybe even what can, and can't be done. We're having some discussions, some thoughts I've been thinking about is that there's a lot of ideas out there that, okay, we can do X, Y, and Z, but it's well, are farmers going to be involved with that? Can we actually do that in production agriculture? Dusty Weis: So Jon, as the CEO of The National Crow Growers Association, as you look at the five sustainability goals targeted for 2030, what are your impressions of those? Obviously when you're setting goals, you want to set something that's not impossible to reach. It's a challenge, but it's not easy or a slam dunk either. So how did you go about determining where to set those goals? Jon Doggett: Well again, those goals were set by farmers and they looked at their operations and what are the five key areas that they can affect the sustainability of the crops that they're growing? So that's really important. What I see, the product of this report is one that can be used in a lot of different ways. We are going to our customers and they in turn can go to their customers and say, here's the sustainability report from The National Crow Growers Association, the organization that represents the 300,000 people who raise corn every year in this country. That's a big, big tool and something that's really important in what we are hearing over and over again from those customers. And I was on a call with them earlier this week, they were just delighted that we've gone through this effort. And they said, this is something that's important, really, really important to us. Jon Doggett: We're also going to be using that in Washington, DC. We're going to be having a discussion in Washington about climate change. And if you have the metrics and you have the data and you have the commitment from people on the ground, at the fork of the crick that they're doing the right thing, and here's how they're doing it. That's a pretty powerful story to tell because we're not just telling the story of everybody who raises corn in this country, but we're talking about the Brandon Hunnicutts, we're talking about the Jon Lenders. We're talking about the Dennis McNninchs. Those personal stories are replicated in that report over and over again. And that is the power of the grassroots organization that engages its membership to drive innovation and to drive commitment to the future. And that's why this is so important. It's a pretty cool deal. Brandon Hunnicutt: A couple of things we need to keep in mind that, our goals are based on resource efficiencies, not overall resource usage. We continue to become more efficient at producing corn. And we always talk about doing more with less. And we have begun to see that long-term, is that we're utilizing less, let's just say nitrogen, less nitrogen per pound of bushel of corn produced. That becomes a big deal. And as we work with seed companies and we work with other providers and we can figure out how to drive that number down, even farther and increase yield, it becomes a huge play within the sustainability world. Not just for the sustainable practices, but also to the farmer's bottom line and being able to comfort level of, if I put that nitrogen out there, I know it's going to be available when the plant needs it. Brandon Hunnicutt: We also focus on long-term gains and avoid singling out progress made or lost during any one year. And I think that's important because there's, you look over the last handful of years in by handful. I mean, from 2012, compared to 2019, compared to 2020, there are challenges out there on a given basis and depending on your location, it doesn't matter if you're one year in your South Dakota and they're drowning in water. And the next year, North Dakota they're planting and dry dirt. That's just the nature of farming. And it's important to realize that and that as we're trying to move things forward to that one year, it doesn't completely change all of that. That comes back to some years are better than others, even when it comes to yield. We can really have a great looking year going into yield, and then all of a sudden the weather changes and without understanding what goes on, on corn pollination, when the humidity's the wrong number at the wrong time of the day. And next thing you know, you don't have corn that's pollinated, everything else is perfect, and you have one year that goes down. Well, that becomes a big issue, but here we try to make sure we don't focus on those. Dusty Weis: So what comes next then? This process has been underway for a while NCGA is putting out the report. But if I'm a corn grower listening right now, I might be sitting here thinking this all sounds great, but you haven't told me yet how I'm going to reach these goals, or if I'm going to be expected to change my production practices. Jon, first of all, it's important to point out that this is a set of goals. It's not a mandate, but what comes next? Jon Doggett: Certainly, these are aspirational goals. We're not imposing these goals on anyone. But what we are saying is, is that the grower input said these are aspirational goals that we believe can be met with concerted effort over time, by the year 2030. So I think that the corn grower that has not been involved in this process can take a look at this process and realize very quickly, Hey, this has been put together by people like me. This is not something that came out of a land grant university. This is not something that came out of a think tank. This is not something that came out of the environmental community. This is not something that's been mandated by USDA. This is a program written by, and for people who produce corn in this country. But always, we need to remember that most producers already are implementing sustainable practices. And really you couldn't be in the business if you weren't doing some sustainable practices because otherwise you wouldn't be in business. Jon Doggett: So that's one of the key elements that's been highlighted in our sustainability report. It's showcasing all of the great efforts that are underway. And as Brandon said, there are things that work in south-central Nebraska that don't work in northern Ohio, or in South Dakota, or in Maryland. So there are so many great things that are going on out there. They're individual stories that when you aggregate all of them, this is just a pretty powerful statement to be made by an industry that I think a lot of people think is still dwelling in the past. It's not, this is the future. Oftentimes when I talk to audiences, I pick up my cell phone saying, what is your cell phone look like 25 years ago? Oh, you mean you had a flip phone. If you were in rural Montana, you probably couldn't get a signal. Why do we assume that cell phone technology has moved at a faster pace than agronomic technology? And I think that's a really important thing to talk about. Brandon Hunnicutt: We talk about farmers being concerned about changing practices in the future. That we're doing that farmers already evaluate on a yearly basis, what practices are working, what practices maybe aren't working. What they need to change for those practices, whether it comes from environmental reasons, whether it comes from, you have landlords that have certain requirements in place, or you're just really trying to figure out, okay, what can I do to change things on the farm? Because maybe I have a specific market and they're wanting their product, quote unquote, sustainably sourced. And so you really look at those things on a day-to-day basis and year-to-year basis. And I think setting a goal is puts a stake in the ground for where we want to go and allows us to measure that progress. And I think that's always good because we do it with yield. Brandon Hunnicutt: Every year we measure everything based off of yield, let's do the same thing with sustainability. Let's do that same concept and say, okay, what is my change year over year on sustainability? Is that measure soil carbon. Does that measure water usage? What is that? But let's set those same goals and let's do that the same way we do with yield. It's really an exciting time to be a farmer. There's so much technology. There's so much changing on a year-to-year and day-to-day basis. And you just see what's coming down the line from a full-on sustainability point, whether it's robotics, whether it's drones, whether it's biological, seed technology, there's all these things out there that all go right back to sustainability. The more we can produce with less, whatever that less is, less time, less effort, less fertilizer, less water. Brandon Hunnicutt: Those are all important factors within sustainability. And it's always fun because there's so much potential right now in AG and people are paying attention to it. And especially when it comes to climate change. And you realize that we are now the group that can lead this discussion. We are the group. What we've always been concerned about is somebody coming at us with a climate change claim and trying to change our industry. And we can be the leaders in it. And we have to be the leaders in it. We have to take these things seriously, and we have to look at them from the standpoint of we are corn farmers. We do things very, very well. We also know we can do things a whole lot better, and we will make sure that whether it's the ethanol that goes into our vehicles, whether it's the food that goes to the livestock, whether it's corn chips. We are going to be the leaders in making sure those sustainability goals are met. And that's a very important concept that I hope we all grasp onto. And we realize that we've lived for this moment. As a farmer I've lived for that moment where somebody says, oh, you guys are the front line. And this is the frontline of climate change. And we are it. Jon Doggett: I think that's so well said. And I started working on climate change when I worked for the American Farm Bureau back in the mid 90s, it just seemed anytime that this subject came up, it was those farmers are doing bad things and we continued to have to defend ourselves. And now the discussion is completely different. And the discussion that is coming from the administration, the discussion that is coming from the environmental community is, yeah, you guys are the solutions. We've got a whole lot of details to work out, but they're looking at us as being problem solvers rather than problem creators. And that is just, I think one of the reasons that we all in this industry ought to be really, really proud of the work that has been done on the farm, individual farmers and the work that has been done by this organization by farmers to get us in this point. That when we are going to have a huge discussion in this country about climate change, that people are looking at us as the guys in the white hats. Jon Doggett: I like wearing a white hat. So Dusty we're at the end of another podcast. And this one is kind of cool because I'm going to encourage everyone to visit the NCGA website. That's ncga.com and you can learn more about our sustainability goals and the report. And we're doing something interesting here. We're holding an open comment period on our goals and our report right now. We want to hear from the folks that are listening to this podcast. Go to ncga.com and give us your comments on these goals. I think this is really cool that we are proud of what we've done, and we're willing to listen to input from folks that want to provide us constructive input. I think that's pretty cool deal.

    "title": "NCGA Releases U.S. Corn Sustainability Goals and Report",
    "content": "Today, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) solidified U.S. corn farmers’ commitment to environmental, economic and social sustainability with the release of U.S. Corn Sustainability Goals and the first U.S. Corn Sustainability Report. The report documents a long history of continuous improvement by U.S. corn farmers and the goals set targets for further progress over the next decade. “Corn farmers have demonstrated their commitment to sustainability for decades through their adoption of practices to defend against soil erosion, improve water quality and water use, and management of resources through modern farming advancements,” says John Linder, a farmer from Edison, Ohio, and NCGA President. “NCGA is celebrating this commitment and sharing our story through our Sustainability Report. By setting future goals, we’re both demonstrating our dedication to continued improvement and setting targets to measure this progress.” Farmer-leaders of NCGA are setting five environmental national efficiency goals to further enhance corn production sustainability in the United States by 2030: Increase land-use efficiency by 12%. Increase irrigation water use efficiency by 15%. Reduce soil erosion by 13%. Increase energy use efficiency by 13%. Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 13%. The release of both the report and the sustainability goals is the culmination of an 18-month, farmer-led process. NCGA formed a Corn Sustainability Advisory Group in 2019 to proactively drive the U.S. corn sustainability story and ensure continued demand for the crop. Members of this group--primarily corn farmers from across the U.S.--were involved at every step of the process and made all decisions, including setting the sustainability goals. The goals were ultimately approved by the NCGA Corn Board earlier this year. “Sustainability is and will continue to be an incredibly important part of what we do, and I’m proud that my fellow leaders at NCGA have led our industry in taking these important steps,” says Linder. “As our country and the world examine risks associated with climate change, our commitment to sustainability positions us to play an even bigger role in mitigating these risks in the future.” NCGA is holding an open comment period for farmers, customers and others to provide feedback on the report and sustainability goals.

    "content": "U.S. House Agriculture Committee Chairman David Scott (D-GA) sent a letter yesterday to President Biden expressing his concerns to proposed changes in tax policy that would eliminate the stepped-up basis provisions used by farmers. The letter resulted from a conversation Chairman Scott had with the Corn Board last month on taxes and other priorities. “We appreciate Chairman Scott’s leadership on preserving the stepped-up basis protections in the tax code for America’s corn farmers and stand ready to help him defend our farms and families from harmful taxation,” said NCGA President John Linder.",

    "content": "Last week, KCoe Isom, a food and agriculture consulting and accounting firm, hosted a Tax Reform Watch webinar for corn growers regarding News and Perspective on Tax Planning and Priorities. This webinar addressed questions farmers have surrounding legislative tax proposals and potential impacts on businesses. The discussion was led by KCoe Isom advisors Brian Kuehl, principal; Jim Rein, principal; and Beth Swanson, senior associate. The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) Public Policy Director for Risk Management and Tax, Wayne Stoskopf, opened the webinar with some background remarks. “The National Corn Growers Association partnered with KCoe Isom during the 2017 tax reform, and we asked them to help growers fill in the gaps and answer some tough questions surrounding the release of President Biden’s American Families Plan,” said Stoskopf. NCGA recently joined 40 agricultural organizations in a letter to Congressional leaders outlining key tax priorities, including protecting current estate tax exemptions and preserving the step-up in basis for capital gains. You can read that letter here. You may also view the slide deck presentation from KCoe Isom’s Tax Reform Watch 2021: News and Perspective on Tax Planning and Priorities webinar.",

    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) has launched a new series of one-pagers, diving into the importance of new uses for corn and why corn should be the commercial feedstock of choice. From renewable plastics to novel chemicals, corn is competitively positioned as the commercial feedstock of choice thanks to its sustainability, abundance, and affordability. “NCGA has a lot of great work going on in the new uses space, these materials will serve as a great introductory tool for individuals interested in learning more,” said NCGA Market Development Manager Michael Granché. “There are many frequently used terms, acronyms, and definitions that can make this space a little confusing at times if you don’t happen to have a Ph.D. in chemistry, and I certainly don’t, so these one-pagers will be a helpful resource for our industry.” New uses efforts are overseen by NCGA’s Market Development Action Team (MDAT). One of MDAT’s goals is to identify new and support existing industrial uses of corn. You can find all of NCGA’s new one-pagers, along with information on the Consider Corn Challenge I, II, and III here. And don’t forget, the deadline for Consider Corn Challenge III is June 3!",

    "title": "Road Trips, Playlists and Ethanol The Right Combination for Summer",
    "content": "This article was written by John Linder, National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) President who also farms in Edison, Ohio and published in Agweb's Guest Commentary, May 27, 2021. Memorial Day is the “unofficial” kickoff to summer - planting is winding down, the school year is coming to an end, some good corn-fed products are going on the grill, and people are actually planning summer vacations again. There are so many songs that come to mind when I think of summer and road trips……On the Road Again, Travelin’ Man, Highway to H…..wait…..how about Life is a Highway instead. Where am I going with this? A few months ago, I wrote an opinion piece, The Secret to Clean Air is No Secret. It’s Ethanol. A lot has happened in that time that makes that piece even more relevant today than it was then. There’ve been two new studies highlighting the environmental benefits of renewable corn ethanol. Just this month, a new analysis from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory showed a 23% decrease in corn ethanol’s carbon intensity between 2005 and 2019. Prior to that, scientists from Harvard University, Tufts University and Environmental Health & Engineering Inc., in Carbon Intensity of Corn Ethanol in the United States: State of the Science, showed that corn ethanol reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 46%, compared to gasoline. Additionally, USDA’s recent 90-Day Progress Report on Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry supports the role of agriculture in decarbonizing the transportation sector, pointing out that “The growth of the U.S. biofuels sector, driven in part by the Renewable Fuels Standard, has reduced GHGs and strengthened the rural economy. Ethanol produced from corn reduces GHG emissions relative to gasoline.” Science is on our side. Time and time again, ethanol is shown and proven to be an environmentally friendly clean air choice for consumers. Farmers should be proud that the way we produce corn today is driving down ethanol’s carbon intensity, and our continued production improvements make corn a lower carbon feedstock for lower-carbon fuel. As negotiations continue on an infrastructure package in Washington D.C., it is important that corn ethanol is recognized as the solution readily available today to help combat climate change. So, when you fill up your tank this summer to head out on your road trip, you should feel good about the fact that corn ethanol is a low carbon and reduces harmful tailpipe emissions. Look for higher ethanol blends at the pump like E15, often labeled as Unleaded 88, to help do your part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Let me leave you with one of my favorite lyrics from my summer road trip playlist: Bye-bye, Miss American Pie, Drove my Chevy to the levee on E15, but the levee was dry.",

Chloe Higgins, an ag economics major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, will be working in the NCGA office in Washington, D.C. Danie Brandl is interning with the NCGA office in St. Louis, Missouri. Brandl is majoring in agricultural education at UNL. “Throughout my internship experience, I would like to gain knowledge of how NCGA works and how it advocates for farmers,” said Brandl. “I would also like to gain more experience and knowledge that will help me in the agricultural industry.” Higgins and Brandl are two of seven interns in all who were selected for internships with key cooperator partners of NCB. Students will be based in the offices of the National Corn Growers Association, U.S. Grains Council, U.S. Meat Export Federation, NCB and NeCGA. Although these internships may vary in scope, location, and duration, each is designed to provide students with an overview of Nebraska’s corn industry through real-world professional examples and experiences. “While the Nebraska Corn Board has been offering these internships for many years, the COVID pandemic meant many of our students had to work remotely or postpone their internships last summer,” said David Bruntz, chairman of NCB and farmer from Friend. “I’m pleased our selected students will have a much more typical experience this summer. These internship opportunities are really designed to help support the future leaders of the agricultural industry. It’s always exciting to meet these students early in their professional careers and see how they develop and enhance the industry over the next several years.” In addition to the students gaining real-world experiences throughout the summer and helping fulfill the duties and missions of their respective organizations, the interns are also able to gain valuable insight on possible future careers. Each intern will document their learning experiences through progress updates and social media posts. To keep up with the students throughout the summer, visit nebraskacorn.gov or follow the Nebraska Corn Board on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.",

    "content": "May is National Beef Month, and there’s no better way to celebrate than to recognize our largest animal ag customer and throw a sirloin on the grill. One out of four bushels of added corn demand is due to beef and pork exports. With such demand, NCGA recognizes the value of industry partnership with the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and the U.S. Meat Export Federation. NCGA has continued to be the sole sponsor of NCBA’s Cattlemen’s Education Series, a partnership that strives to bring the latest and greatest industry information to producers while highlighting the value that corn and corn products, such as DDGs, bring to beef rations. “Not only do corn growers benefit from the beef cattle industry’s consumption of corn, but adding corn into the diet promotes faster growth, increases feed efficiency in the rate of daily gain and produces steaks with a higher marble score,” said Market Development Action Team Chair Bob Hemesath. With more than 20 million beef cattle in the U.S., the beef industry consumes more than 1,250 million bushels of corn and provides $5.7 billion in value to the corn industry. In 2018, the value of red meat exports to corn was $1.62 billion and contributed to 11% of bushel value. The projected value of red meat exports to corn from 2018 – 2021 is $19 billion, and $3.2 billion is the projected value of red meat exports to DDGS.

Sixty million rural Americans live and work in rural communities. They rely on reliable and safe infrastructure to effectively move their products and compete globally and roads, bridges, highways and waterways provide the first and last links in the supply chain. America’s inland waterways system provides the most fuel-efficient, lowest cost, and environmentally friendly method of transporting products. Included in the Biden Administration plan is a proposed $17 billion for inland waterways, coastal ports, land ports of entry, and ferries. The inland waterways system is essential to getting U.S. corn to export, with more than 60 percent of the grain produced in the United States being transported by barge, but work needs to be done to bring the nearly 12,000 miles of commercially navigable channels and 240 lock sites up to date. American farmers rely on the inland waterways system to stay competitive internationally with countries like Brazil and Argentina who are quickly moving to surpass the United States in corn production but lack the infrastructure to move their product like the United States. NCGA’s Market Development and Risk Management and Transportation Action Teams have taken an active role in seeking improvement to our nation’s infrastructure.

    "title": "EP. 20 - Corn & Bourbon: Powering Partnerships and Kentuckys Economic Revival",
    "content": "The Kentucky Corn Growers Association and Green River Distilling have teamed up to produce a locally sourced bourbon that supports corn research. With a grain content of at least 51% corn, bourbon is a drink that’s near and dear to every grower’s heart. But in the heart of bourbon country, there’s a really neat partnership taking root between the Kentucky Corn Growers Association and the producers of Yellow Banks bourbon, who source their corn from local growers and donate a portion of their profits to support corn research. In this episode, we’re back at the Frazier Kentucky History Museum in Louisville for part two of our discussion about bourbon, as 8th generation master distiller Jacob Call from Green River Distilling talks about the partnerships… and the relationships… that make Yellow Banks possible. Plus, Frazier Kentucky History Museum president and CEO Andy Treinen talks about how bourbon tourism is helping people reconnect with life on the farm. And Laura Knoth and Adam Andrews from the Kentucky Corn Growers Association discuss how strongly rooted bourbon and corn are in Kentucky’s economy and culture. DIRECT SHARE TRANSCRIPT Jacob Call: We touch agriculture in so many ways in the bourbon industry; everything from the grain, obviously, to the barrels. And it's just important for us to recognize that and to help tell that story. And if we can help tell the corn story, along with Kentucky and bourbon, then it's a win for everyone. Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. Dusty Weis: I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host, Association CEO, Jon Doggett. You can join Jon every month as he travels the country on a mission to advocate for America's corn farmers. From the fields of the Corn Belt, to the DC Beltway, we'll make sure the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them; with the key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: With a grain content at least 51% corn, bourbon is a drink that's near and dear to every grower's heart. But in the heart of bourbon country, there's a really neat partnership taking root between the Kentucky Corn Growers Association and the producers of Yellow Banks Bourbon, who source their corn from local growers and donate a portion of their profits to support corn research. Dusty Weis: In this episode, we're back at the Frazier Kentucky History Museum in Louisville for part two of our discussion on bourbon. But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also make sure you follow the NCGA on Twitter at National Corn. And sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. Dusty Weis: And with that, it's time to, once again, introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. Jon, we're picking up where we left off in episode 19, continuing our discussion on bourbon, here at the start of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail, the Frazier Kentucky History Museum in Louisville. Jon Doggett: You know, Dusty, we're really lucky. We're joined by some of the world's foremost experts on bourbon. So we have Andy Treinen, he's the President and CEO here at the Frazier Museum. He programs and leads much of the museum's bourbon themed programming. Jon Doggett: And in case there's any doubt after the last episode, Andy's more than comfortable behind a microphone. Prior to joining the museum, I understand you had a 25 year career in television? Andy Treinen: That's right. I started working in television in my hometown, Cincinnati. Spent three years in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Dusty lives. And then the last nine here in Louisville, Kentucky, at the ABC Affiliate. And people were always like, \"How did you go from a career in television to being a president of the museum?\" I was originally marketing director here, and then vice president, and then president. Andy Treinen: And it's really simple. And if you think about it, we tell stories, right? I told stories every day that kind of went off into space after they were told when I worked in television. And now we tell stories that are longer lasting, sometimes a six month run, 12 month run. And in the case of our Spirit of Kentucky bourbon exhibition, it's a permanent run because this is a permanent exhibit here at the Frazier History Museum, telling stories about great Kentucky agriculture, and the limestone shelf, and the titans in the industry that have made Kentucky the home of bourbon. Jon Doggett: Okay. Jon Doggett: And Jacob Call, he's the Master Distiller at Green River Distilling in Owensboro, Kentucky; an eighth generation distiller. And Jacob, both your dad and your grandfather worked at one of the more recognizable names in bourbon, Jim Beam. Jacob Call: Yes, that's right. Yeah, my family dates back to 1791. Samuel Call was making a little bourbon whiskey in Bourbon County back then. And my grandfather worked at Jim Beam, my father worked at Jim Beam. So yeah, I'm just really excited to get to carry on that family legacy. Jon Doggett: And we're also joined by Laura Knoth, who is the Executive Director of the Kentucky Corn Growers Association. And Adam Andrews, who is the Program Director at Kentucky Corn. Jon Doggett: Welcome to both of you, thanks for being on this episode. Laura Knoth: Thank you, Jon. We're excited to be here in the Kentucky Frazier History Museum. And Kentucky Corn Growers helped with this exhibit that we're sitting in today. Our growers saw the benefit of using some of our checkoff dollars to invest in this exhibit that shows the hundreds of thousands of visitors that you'll have over time about Kentucky agriculture, and especially about Kentucky corn and the products that the corn are going into, the bourbon products of our state. And so we were excited to be a part of this project. Jon Doggett: Okay. So we ended the last episode talking about that strong relationship between the corn grower and the distiller, absolutely essential. So want to pick up on that theme, Laura, that you just mentioned, about partnership. And the one in this building and in this museum that is just so really neat. And when we walked in this morning, I just thought, \"God, this is really cool stuff.\" Laura Knoth: This has been great fun, working with the bourbon industry, for multiple reasons, as you can imagine. But we've got a great relationship, collaboration going with the Green River Distilling Company, and working with Jacob and his team to develop Yellow Banks Bourbon. So it has their logo and they produce it, but we've put our logo on it because it's one of those that, during the last episode we talked about, it has a high corn mash bill. Laura Knoth: And Jacob has created an outstanding bourbon, Yellow Banks. And what's great about it is not only does he get to tell the story of Kentucky corn as he produces it, but we also get some of the proceeds, a percentage of that, proceeds from the sale of that bourbon come back for sustainable agriculture research. His distillery, as well as the majority of distilleries in our state, are so great about wanting to make sure that we produce corn in this state for generations to come. And sustainable ag research, those dollars are going to be used to make sure that that happens. Jon Doggett: And Jacob, you and I talked, your company wants to do three things. What are those three things? Jacob Call: Yep. So when we create a brand, we want it to look good, taste good, and then do good. So this definitely checks off our do good initiative, 5% of the sales go back to sustainable farm research that Laura was talking about. Jacob Call: So we touch agriculture in so many ways in the bourbon industry; everything from the grain, obviously, to the barrels. And it's just important for us to recognize that and to help tell that story. And if we can help tell the corn story, along with Kentucky and bourbon, then it's a win for everyone. Jon Doggett: Well, thank you so much. And thanks to your company for doing that. You folks have put your money where your mouth is and we greatly appreciate it. Jon Doggett: So Adam, we auctioned off some Yellow Banks Bourbon for the pack a couple months ago. Tell us about that. Adam Andrews: Laura and I were both pleased to get one of the first bottles out of the run. Still sitting on my desk- Laura Knoth: Don't ask him if it's full. Adam Andrews: It's not full. It's not full. I broke the seal on the signed bottle that came off on one of the first runs. Adam Andrews: But yes, we've always given a six pack, I think, of bourbon to the pack. And this year it was Yellow Banks. Previous years, I think we've done Woodford, we've done some Elijah Craig, Knob Creek. I think we'll stick with Yellow Banks now since it's got our logo on it, which yeah, absolutely, we've enjoyed participating in the pack. I don't know if Jacob would sell it for what it sold for if he knew how much he'd brought at the packs, but ... Jon Doggett: You haven't told him yet, have you? Adam Andrews: I have not told him yet. But Jacob has done a great job with us, it's been so productive for telling corn's story. Their tasting room has a salon, a corner of it that has a Kentucky Corn Growers dedicated to that theme. Once we get things back moving after COVID completely goes away, we've got a lot of great things in the pipeline for telling corn's story through this very popular product. Dusty Weis: Jon, question for you, you travel around the United States of America, and you'll come across lots of different regions where there's a specific beverage or a specific food product that's unique to that area. But you don't see a lot of partnerships like you have here with Yellow Banks and the State Corn Growers of Kentucky; a) how unique is that, in your experience? And b) what does it mean to the Corn Growers of Kentucky to be able to pick up a bottle of bourbon and look at it and say, \"This is my grain right here?\" Jon Doggett: I see occasional, in real small regions maybe, a connection between farmers and a particular ranch or something, but nothing like this, nothing that goes from the seed in the ground to the whiskey in the glass like this place does. It's truly remarkable. And it's something I think we ought to take a look at, are there other opportunities in other parts of the country where we can connect what a corn farmer does on the farm to something that ends up in a glass, or on your plate, or whatever? It's just such a unique thing, and it's certainly one that we ought to try to find ways to replicate because it has been a real boom for this state. Andy Treinen: Jon, it's a gracious industry. And that's something that we tapped into with this exhibit, Spirit of Kentucky, very early on. In fact, if you go into the next chapter of this exhibit that we're sitting in ... we call it the Gracious room, and it's a huge dining room table; because it's a gracious industry and everybody's welcome at the table. Andy Treinen: It's actually a multimillion dollar tactile table where you can call up stories and everybody is represented on there. But some of the stories that you'll see that represent that are when there's a lightning strike and a fire out at Jim Beam, every other distiller starts coming and contributing product, and contributing barrels, and contributing corn. They never lost a day of production when there was that fire out at Heaven Hill in 1994, I think it was, Jacob, is that right? Jacob Call: Yeah. Andy Treinen: And so this industry, they compete on the shelf like every other industry, they want to sell a little bit more than the other guy. But we partner all the time. That's why these relationships with the Kentucky Corn Growers Association and the National Corn Growers Association are so important, because this is an $8.6 billion industry in the state of Kentucky. Brings $8.6 billion each and every year. And with that comes an awful lot of jobs; jobs in agriculture, jobs in production, in bourbon. Andy Treinen: So this partnership with the Kentucky Corn Growers is really about bringing students through here. We bring 20,000 students through here every year in field trips and camps. And they can learn about the industry, not as consumers of the product, but as people who can eventually work in the industry. Jon Doggett: So, Jacob Call, you have mentioned that you're an eighth generation distiller. You talked about your father and your grandfather. There might've been an ancestor right before that one. Talk about prohibition and how did that work in this state? Because we know that production didn't stop. We certainly know that the consumption didn't stop. How did the industry get through from the Volstead Act to repeal what happened? Jacob Call: Yeah, so prohibition was definitely a dark age in the state of Kentucky and the bourbon industry. And was about a 13 year failed experiment, 1920 to 1933. And a lot of distilleries went out of business. The Green River Distillery dates back to 1885, but it was closed. Actually a fire got it right before prohibition. Maybe a coincidence, who knows? But there was a lot of unscrupulous actors during prohibition, a lot of just bad whisky was produced. Which led to some regulation and some changes with the Bottled-in-Bond Act, things like that, to really protect bourbon and the industry itself. Jacob Call: And that's where a lot of the larger brand's marketing started coming about after prohibition. And now I think we're kind of back in the golden age of bourbon, people have rediscovered how great and versatile bourbon is. I think a lot of that has to do with the cocktail culture. Could be Mad Men, the TV series, that has brought bourbon back into the mainstay. But we don't really care how you drink bourbon, just as long as you drink it. Jon Doggett: So talking about that and the evolution of the cocktail culture, how have generations used that evolution? What was the evolution in the last 15, 20 years, even in the last 10 years? It's evolved a lot, hasn't it? Jacob Call: So vodka was the drink of choice for a lot of people, say, 20 years ago, 15 years ago. Andy Treinen: What were they thinking? Jacob Call: I don't know what they were thinking. There's nothing to it. I just think that people didn't want to drink what their parents were drinking. People wanted to drink something with a little more character, something that they could learn about and research where their product was coming from. And with all of the rules and regulations around bourbon, they kind of fit right in to the rediscovering where your food and where your drinks come from. And also that cocktail culture that we talked about, the Manhattans and the Old Fashions, what's old is new again. Laura Knoth: And what's great is that Jacob has tapped into this market around the world. It has been impressive to hear where he's sending our Kentucky bourbon. Jon Doggett: How many countries are you selling bourbon in? Jacob Call: Yeah. I don't have the exact number, but we ship large ISO tankers, in bulk, of bourbon all around the world in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Italy. And that'll be bottled, maybe, under their own label. Laura Knoth: It was great to be with the U.S. Meat Export Federation on a trip to Japan, talking about how our corn going into red meat that's going into the Japanese market. And go to a grocery store and not only see steak that was probably grown right here in the United States with our corn, but also to see bourbon in a can, like a soda pop, being sold in the grocery store. Andy Treinen: Bourbon in a can? Laura Knoth: Bourbon in a can. It was great. I kept looking to make sure it had a Kentucky logo on it, and it did. Jon Doggett: Oh, okay. Jon Doggett: Jacob Call, you are an eighth generation master distiller. We've said that several times throughout the podcast. What is a master distiller? Jacob Call: Now, that may be the question that I get the most. People, when they come on tours, want to know that. So there's no official designation, no school, no title, no test that you have to take. I actually tell people that it's a lot like being a farmer. A lot of that is just passed down from generation to generation, all of that knowledge and know-how. Andy Treinen: So the prerequisites are to call yourself a master distiller and then not get called out by anybody for not being one? Jacob Call: I don't know about that. Jon Doggett: Andy Treinen, tell us about the Bourbon Trail. I mean, where is it? Andy Treinen: Great segue, Jon, you must be a professional. Jon Doggett: No, but I play one. Andy Treinen: What they're talking about there, this trend that ... I get asked the question all the time, \"Are you worried that there's going to be another downward trend and bourbon's not going to be popular again and vodka is going to regain popularity, or some other spirit?\" And I really don't. And I know that there are people far smarter than me forecasting 25, 30, 40 years out. Andy Treinen: But the difference right now is that bourbon tourism is alive and well. The Kentucky Bourbon Trail is alive and well. The Kentucky Bourbon Trail went from 700,000 people visiting Kentucky, to 900,000 people visiting Kentucky, to 1.2 million, 1.4 million, 1.6 million. And then the pandemic hit and we had a little backward slide last year, but those numbers will continue. And there are so many people out there telling the Kentucky bourbon story. And there are tourists who want to come to the state and learn about the authenticity of this brand. I think it's going to continue to grow and there's no room for a backward slide anytime soon. Andy Treinen: All of these distilleries have created guest experiences for people to come, enjoy the bourbon, learn a little bit about the story. And the distillers do a great job of telling people how bourbon is made and showing them the nuances that makes their bourbon very special. Here at the Frazier History Museum, in our Spirit of Kentucky exhibition, it's about the category of bourbon and why Kentucky is the home. So it starts with the water, it starts with, there were more navigable waterways in the state of Kentucky than any state, other than Alaska. And the limestone shelf here is very unique to this area. There are two other areas in the world that have a similar limestone shelf, and that's Scotland and Ireland. So that filters out the iron and makes it much easier for master distillers, like Jacob, to do their job. The change of seasons that we talked about is perfect for bourbon production here. And, of course, the great agriculture and the corn growers that give us the primary ingredient in the product. Jon Doggett: So if I come to Kentucky and I want to go on the Bourbon Trail, what do I do? Andy Treinen: You contact the Frazier History Museum, what a great question. But actually, if you call the Kentucky Bourbon Trail, if you go to the website and call that number, our people answer down in the Welcome Center, that is our Kentucky Bourbon Trail Welcome Center. And they will ask you questions about your preferences. Where are you going to end your day? Do you need a lunch somewhere? What are your favorite brands? Do you like wheated bourbon? Do you like a more spicy bourbon? And they will help you curate your guest experience in the state of Kentucky. Andy Treinen: It used to be a simple trail, \"Oh, I'm going to go to these 11 different locations and complete the task.\" Well, now, there are 19 heritage brands, there are 18 craft brands, and it would take you two weeks to complete the trail. Have at it, we welcome you to do it. But it's more of an experience along the way than it is completing a finite start here and end here. Jon Doggett: So you don't give anybody a roadmap and say, \"Okay, stop one, stop two, stop three?\" Andy Treinen: We do. Yeah, those are available. There is actually a book that you can get that'll take you through each one and give you some fine points about what makes them unique, their points of differentiation. And you can check those off as you go. Andy Treinen: When the trail was much smaller, it was, if you complete the trail, you get a glass or a t-shirt. But now it's so big, and it covers so many miles, and the expansion is happening so fast, that we're just curating that regionally and helping people with how they manage their trips and helping them to book their trips as well, if they need help with that. Jon Doggett: Okay. Jon Doggett: Laura, talk a little bit more about your relationship with the museum and how you got started with the museum, and what has happened since then? Laura Knoth: We've got a great relationship with the Frazier History Museum. They contacted us and said they were putting together an agriculture exhibit and wanted to focus on America's native spirits, and obviously bourbon and the whole story. And what we have appreciated so much about working with the Frazier, is you come in and you see all about bourbon, you see all about Kentucky, you see all about agriculture, and you can look on the exhibits and you can see the old tools, which are always fascinating to see, is how we started production with hand tools. And then you look at the videos and the Gracious Table, as Andy was describing, and you see today's operations. What I appreciated was they brought you through the whole thing and they're not afraid to show you the whole story of agriculture, and especially the sustainable agriculture story of corn production. And we appreciated that very much. Laura Knoth: And then they tell the personal stories. We've got pictures of our farmer leaders in this book, old pictures. We've got a great picture, I was so glad that he shared it. One of our board members, he's got a bottle in his mouth. His mom's holding him while they were picking corn back in the day. And it was going to one of the local distilleries. I mean, that is a neat story. Jon Doggett: It was a bottle of milk though? He was a little baby. I'm sorry, we want to make sure that- Laura Knoth: It was a bottle of milk, yes. That's all right. It was a baby bottle, let me make that point clear. Yes, absolutely. But that just shows you just how ingrained, how long this story has been a part of our Kentucky culture. Jon Doggett: Nothing's more compelling than people telling their own personal story through whatever venue. And it's not only important to the person who's hearing that story but, for your growers, it has to be really important that they see their story told? Because I think, all too often, we don't get a good opportunity to do that. Laura Knoth: Absolutely. And like I said, that's why we were so proud to partner with these folks because they wanted to tell the real story. Jon Doggett: Certainly, just my quick tour of the museum, it's fascinating. There's hardly a square inch here that doesn't somehow tie back to Kentucky agriculture; whether it's the corn or the oak or whatever. It's just a really neat tie that is constant. Laura Knoth: Absolutely. And the distilleries, so many of them, as Andy and Jacob have said, have tasting rooms. And they are proud of that story and they tell it, and they talk about the farmers that matter in their production. Jacob's facility, the Green River Distillery, has got a salon, a display area, that is all about Kentucky agriculture that we got to work with them to develop, to tell that story, and they wanted to make sure that it was accurate. Laura Knoth: And we just find that is a wonderful outreach to the consumers. As we've all talked about, every farmer will say, \"People just don't understand agriculture.\" Well, this is a way for us to help explain it. Jon Doggett: Jacob, what is the question you get from customers of yours about agriculture that startles you; as not only a distiller, but as a farmer and a farm kid? Jacob Call: I think it's just surprise. I think that there's no really one question that I get. I think they're in awe when they see our grain bins. And it kind of just puts the puzzle piece back together for them. At Green River Distillery, we're a Heritage member on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. We have people from around the world, that they've probably never been on a farm, come to our distillery. Jacob Call: And, as Laura mentioned, we've created this salon or area inside of our Welcome Center. And it's dedicated to, not only the Yellow Banks Bourbon brand, but also we have videos of combines and farmers out in the fields, we have drone footage, we have a big Kentucky Corn Growers sign going up on one of our grain bins. So, we're all in when it comes to Kentucky agriculture, the Kentucky farmer. Jacob Call: And in our gift shop, people can buy a bottle of Yellow Banks that helps support Kentucky agriculture. Now, in Kentucky, you can also buy it online. We can ship it around the state, and to 10 or 12 other states. So I think that it's important for us to be able to help convey that message to the public. Jon Doggett: I think one of the things that, as I look at it through, certainly, a different prism, you look at the exhibits here, it ties back to an individual farmer. They're real people. I mean, that's the thing that has struck me about this whole conversation, is we're talking about real people all the way through the whole process. And that's really pretty cool. Adam Andrews: Yeah. And they're seeing those farms as they travel the Bourbon Trail. It's all through these hills and hollers of corn production and weight production through central Kentucky, where most of the bourbon distilleries on the trail are. They're seeing these farms, they're seeing these grain legs and bins, and seeing the equipment on the road, and things like that. Andy Treinen: Yeah. And we're happy to bring the names of those farmers into the story because people are familiar with the brand names. Well, most of those brand names, many of the master distillers or production specialists at the very beginning, and you talk about Elijah Craig, and George T. Stagg, James E. Pepper. And then the next wave, Jimmy Russell and Bill Samuels, Booker Noe, Parker Beam, Jim Rutledge, Jacob Call. That next generation and that resurgence of bourbon that came, really, through more of the craft type brands, it's authentic and it starts with the farmers. Because that's where the production starts, with the growing of the corn, that makes us a Kentucky story. Jon Doggett: Jacob, your company, what are you seeing for the bourbon industry going down the road 10, 15 years from now? More of just continuing to have high-quality product? What opportunities do you see for your industry going forward to expand what you're doing? Jacob Call: Well for so many years, bourbon has been very traditional. And that's the way we make our bourbon, our bourbon starts out very traditionally produced. Much like my grandfather and father did, very similar. But I think now we're starting to see a lot of barrel finish expressions. You'll finish a barrel maybe in a sherry barrel, or a wine barrel, or something like that. Really just to give it a different character, maybe a sweeter profile. So I think that's really where we're going next. There's a lot of different barrel expressions out on the market now. Got some that we're working on. Jacob Call: But Green River, were always going to be tradition first. We have a brand. We've actually resurrected the Green River Bourbon brand, it's been out of existence for a long time. We're going to be launching that this fall, and it's going to be a bottled-in-bond Green River bourbon whiskey that we're going to be excited to share with the world. Jon Doggett: That sounds pretty cool. So you talked about ... and I've heard this expression other places ... finishing it in a sherry barrel. But Andy said you have to put it in a new barrel. So do you take it out of the new barrel and put it in another barrel? Is that what you do with the barrels? Jacob Call: Yes. So, you have to put that on the label. Anytime you finish it in a sherry barrel, port barrel, wine barrel, you just have to clearly state that on the label. But it always has to start out in a brand new charred oak barrel, to start. Jon Doggett: So how long will the bourbon be in the new barrel before it goes to the other barrel? Jacob Call: Well, it depends. It could be as little as two years, could be four years. That's really up to the distiller. As long as you disclose it on the label, what you're doing. Jon Doggett: That's one of the interesting things that's just so cool about your industry, is you talk about short periods of time being two or four years. The bourbon that you're distilling today, how many years will it be before that bourbon you're distilling today will be in somebody's glass? Jacob Call: Well, the Green River brand that's going to launch this fall, that'll be about four and a half years old. It makes planning very difficult. Forecasting is very challenging in the bourbon industry. Jon Doggett: One of the most rewarding things our growers see is when their product goes into somebody else's product, and to see people that really put their hearts in producing the basic product or the product that comes after that. And that's why I think bourbon and corn have such a compelling story to tell about that relationship. Jon Doggett: So, you folks all work in this industry in this state. What do you love about it? What motivates you to come to work every morning? Jon Doggett: Adam, we're going to start with you first. Adam Andrews: Now, Jacob's bottle of Yellow Banks motivates me and everyone. Jon Doggett: Or there's that [inaudible 00:27:10], there's- Adam Andrews: ... [crosstalk 00:27:11] right around the policy call. Jon Doggett: We didn't know that that was a fringe benefit of Kentucky corn. But yeah, you're going to get a lot of resumes now. Adam Andrews: It's the people, that's probably going to be the answer you get all around the table, largely. But it's the people, it's the purpose. It's knowing that we're working and advocating for meaningful industry, corn particularly. Meaningful industry, meaningful people and families. Jon Doggett: Laura, how about you? Laura Knoth: Well, Adam hit it. It's about the people that we get to work for and represent, and the opportunities. We are so excited to see that bourbon is growing and that more people are discovering our fabulous product around the world. And we just see a great future for it and for the growers of this state. And that's our job, is to make sure that it's here for the longterm. Jon Doggett: Okay. Jon Doggett: Jacob? Jacob Call: Yeah, it is the people, it's the relationships. It's getting to come to work every day and know that you're creating a product that's going to bring a memory or a great life experience to somebody around the world. And we're representing this great state of Kentucky. There's a lot of us, few of us master distillers out here, and we take our job very seriously to get to share Kentucky's story with the world. And if we can help tell corn's story while we're doing it, I think that's even better. Jon Doggett: Andy? Andy Treinen: Yeah. I mean, I started this episode talking about how we tell stories. And I love to tell stories about this great Kentucky brand and Kentucky bourbon. But when I go home and my wife asks me, \"How was your day? What did you do today?\" I tell her stories about the people that I spent the day with. So today that's Dusty, and Jon, and Laura, and Adam, and Jacob. And I'll tell how this is how I started my day. My days vary a great deal, and they're good and they're more rich because of the people I get to spend time with every day. Andy Treinen: So it's definitely about the people and the stories that are told. In this case, on the podcast, but often cases when the podcast isn't rolling. Jon Doggett: It's all about telling the stories. And that's why we do this podcast, is it's one way to tell the stories. But what we've talked about today is you all tell those stories in various places. So if you're in Louisville, the address here is? Andy Treinen: We are at 829 West Main Street, right across the street from the Louisville Slugger Museum on Main Street in downtown Louisville. Multiple distilleries here on Main Street, you can participate in tastings and tours at a handful of them. Right now, I think there are four that are open entirely. Normally there are nine right here within a walking distance of the official starting point of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail, which is the Frazier History Museum. Jon Doggett: And that website? Andy Treinen: Fraziermuseum.org. Jon Doggett: And Frazier is spelled how? Andy Treinen: F-R-A-Z-I-E-R. Thank you very much. Jon Doggett: You bet. Dusty Weis: I want to come back to the fact that you guys do tastings at the museum too. Andy Treinen: Yep. Dusty Weis: Who says museums are boring? Andy Treinen: No kidding, right? It's actually called the Ready, Set, Go! tasting experience because you get a little education about bourbon in that and then you get your passport to go out on the trail, that you mentioned, and you get a little bourbon glass to drink it with and basically learn a little bit about the brands that you're about to go taste. Andy Treinen: The one point of differentiation that we have, which is actually nice, if you go to any particular brand, you're going to taste that brand's product. We can do cross-brand tastings here at the Frazier. So, say, these are the most three popular wheated bourbons, or these are all 9 to 12 years in the barrel bourbons. And you can taste the nuances across brands, as opposed to going to one brand and tasting that particular brand. Dusty Weis: Jon is the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. As you've walked around in this museum and looked around, what's the neatest thing you've seen here today? Jon Doggett: Oh, I don't know whether it's ... I think it might be the old bottles. I don't know, how old is the oldest bottle? Andy Treinen: 1897. Jon Doggett: 1897. Andy Treinen: We had to up the insurance for that room because there's some really outstanding stuff in there. And then we do have a Pappy Van Winkle gallery in the back, which is not only all of the Pappy Van Winkles that people can get today, but all of the stuff that Pappy himself distilled; the old Fitzgerald and Weller products that people are so fond of. Jon Doggett: And then there's the room with all of the bourbons made in this state. Andy Treinen: Yeah. And actually, we've got to get an update from Jacob on that. Because in that room, the concept is you can take your photograph with every bourbon currently in production in the state of Kentucky. As you might imagine, these guys are aggressive. It's changing and developing all the time. So keeping that Bottle Hall up-to-date, we try to do it quarterly, but it's a great photo opportunity. Andy Treinen: And when there's not COVID going on, we also have a little placard that you can hold. And it says: my bourbon number is ... And the intent is you're supposed to count how many of them that you've tasted and then put your bourbon number there and do your photo op. I think I'm at like 230. Jon Doggett: Adam, what's your number? Adam Andrews: 73. Not 230, wow. Andy Treinen: It's my job to educate myself. Jon Doggett: It's a hard job, but somebody's got to do it, don't they? Jon Doggett: So I do have to do a shout-out, because the room with all of the bourbons made in this state, I saw two bottles that remind me of our former colleague, Sam Willett, who's a native of Kentucky. And his family was in the bourbon business for, I don't know how long, but a long, long time. I don't think, they are not now affiliated with that distillery. But certainly, Sam has regaled us with a lot of stories about Kentucky bourbon and the Willett brand, and the fun his family had in that industry for a long, long time. Jon Doggett: And talking to him just is so similar to this conversation we're having, it's about relationships, it's about agriculture, it's about consumers, touching people, all of those things. And that just what makes this conversation a real fun one. Laura Knoth: Jon, you had asked about growers' relationships with the distilleries. And one of those fun conversations, like you were talking about, is listening to the distilleries. Where we would go in and try to ask them to expand the number of farmers that they were buying from locally. And they're very careful to say they've had the buyer who worked there at the distillery who had been there for 30+ years. And they had been buying from these particular farms for over 30 years. So just great long-term family connections there for so many of them. Jon Doggett: So reminiscent of my background in the cattle business. There was a very small number of order buyers that my dad, or my uncle, or my brother would deal with. You have a relationship, you continue with the relationship. When you let somebody else sort your cattle and run them across the scale, you know you've probably got a pretty good relationship. And that's kind of the same thing I'm seeing here as well. Jon Doggett: So, it's just been a real treat. We've heard about bourbon's past, strong ties to the corn industry, the bright future it has ahead of it. Thanks again for allowing us here to set up in the beautiful Frazier Kentucky History's Museum, the official starting point of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. So that's Frazier Museum President and CEO, Andy Treinen; Jacob Call, Master Distiller at Green River Distilling; Laura Knoth and Adam Andrews from Kentucky Corn Growers Association, thanks so much for joining us on the podcast.

    "content": "This week, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) joined 39 agricultural organizations in a letter to Congressional leaders outlining key tax priorities including protecting current estate tax exemptions and preserving the step-up in basis for capital gains. The letter comes just after President Biden proposed the American Families Plan, the second part of the President Build Back Better Plan. The plan includes over $1 trillion in new investments throughout the economy and $800 billion in tax cuts. The $1.8 trillion plan proposes paying for the investments and tax cuts through reforms to the tax code, including ending the step-up of basis for capital gains more than $1 million ($2 million per couple). According to the White House, “the reform will be designed with protections so that family-owned businesses and farms will not have to pay taxes when given to heirs who continue to run the business.” The Administration is expected to continue to release more details on the proposals within the American Families Plan over the next few weeks. USDA has further outlined the potential protections for family farms. Congress will ultimately decide, and vote on, the provisions included in any infrastructure and tax legislation. Discussions on Capitol Hill regarding a package are currently taking place, and NCGA is sharing corn farmer priorities with members of the House and Senate",

    "content": "The American Jobs Plan, the Biden Administration’s $2 trillion infrastructure proposal, includes several provisions directly impacting corn growers. Rural Americans rely on reliable and safe infrastructure to effectively move their products and compete globally and roads, bridges, highways and waterways provide the first and last links in the supply chain. The proposal’s $115 billion to modernize 20,000 miles of highways as well as roads and bridges would target the most economically significant large bridges and repair the worst 10,000 smaller bridges. If approved by Congress, this funding would meet the needs of our crumbling infrastructure. The nation’s rural roads and bridges have significant deficiencies due to underfunding. 15 percent of the nation’s major rural roads have pavements rated in poor condition, 21% in mediocre condition, and 10 percent rated structurally deficient. Congress will ultimately decide, and vote on, the provisions included in any infrastructure legislation.

    "title": "New Study Finds Corn Ethanol Champions Lower Greenhouse Gas Emissions",
    "content": "A new analysis from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory concludes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from corn ethanol are now 44% to 52% lower than gasoline, thanks to improvements in the efficiency of both corn and ethanol production. The retrospective study analyzed data from U.S. corn and ethanol production between 2005 and 2019, finding a 23% decrease in corn ethanol’s carbon intensity. (This reduction is due to improvements in corn yield, decreases in fertilizer intensity inputs, increases in ethanol yields, and reductions in ethanol plant energy use.) From the 15 years studied, an additional 140 million metric tons (MMT) GHG emission reductions were made possible by the reduction in corn ethanol’s carbon intensity. “Relying on updated data and the best science show ethanol is truly a low carbon fuel, with the potential to become even more low carbon, thanks to how farmers continue to improve corn production practices and increased yields that produce more corn from less land and fewer inputs,” said NCGA President and Ohio corn farmer, John Linder. The study finds that “The ethanol produced in our 15 years has been introduced to the transportation sector to displace petroleum gasoline. With the displacement, on the LCA basis, corn ethanol has helped the U.S. transportation sector reduce GHG emissions by 544 MMT over the period.” The research also notes that corn ethanol GHG emissions can be reduced further with additional sustainable farming practices such as notill and cover crops that can help reduce fertilizer inputs and increase soil organic carbon content. Finally, the analysis concludes, “Biofuels, including corn ethanol, can play a critical role in the U.S. desire for deep decarbonization of its economy.” This new data comes at an advantageous time, as members of the biofuels industry convene this week for the annual Growth Energy Executive Leadership Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. NCGA staff Jon Doggett, Jim Bauman, and Mark Palmer attend the conference this week with NCGA Board Members John Linder, Kevin Ross and Dennis McNinch. While at the conference, the group is scheduled to meet with Harvard Professor in Environmental Sciences and Low-Carbon Fuels, Dr. Daniel Schrag. You can read the full study here.",

    "content": "Commodity Classic was recently honored in four different categories in Trade Show Executive Magazine where the trade show took home three “Fastest 50” awards and one Gold award for trade show growth. Due to delays by the Covid-19 pandemic, the awards were based on numbers from 2019. During that year, Commodity Classic was identified as the 86th largest U.S. trade show in any industry. Additionally, it ranked in the top 50 among the fastest-growing shows in three categories, which were based on total square feet, number of exhibitors, and number of attendees. Commodity Classic was the only agricultural trade show to be recognized in all three categories. Here were the official rankings of Commodity Classic. To view the entire results, click here. - Gold 100 Ranking - #86 (based on net square feet) - Fastest 50 Ranking - #35 (by percentage of growth in net square feet) - Fastest 50 Ranking - #39 (by percentage of growth in number of exhibitors) - Fastest 50 Ranking - #38 (by percentage of growth in total attendees) The last in-person trade show in San Antonio in 2020 drew the largest number of farmers (4,669) in the show’s history. The last time Commodity Classic was held in New Orleans, in 2016, was the largest show ever attended by farmers, media, and other agribusiness professionals (9,770). The show will again be held in New Orleans on March 10-12, 2022. Commodity Classic provides farmers with a unique combination of outstanding education, top-notch speakers, technology and innovation, a huge trade show, entertainment, and the opportunity to network with thousands of farmers and agricultural innovators from around the world. “Commodity Classic is a phenomenal show, and we’re excited to be back in New Orleans in 2022,” said ASA Director and corn and soybean producer Gerry Hayden, Commodity Classic 2022 co-chair. “Getting back to an in-person event, learning about the latest technologies, and meeting other farmers from around the world – it’s a world-class opportunity. There’s nothing else like it.” Established in 1996, Commodity Classic is America’s largest farmer-led, farmer-focused agricultural and educational experience. It is presented annually by the American Soybean Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Sorghum Producers, and the Association of Equipment Manufacturers.

By reaching “Inside the Beltway,” this campaign, made possible by a collaboration with state associations and highlighting the authentic stories of corn farmers, is designed to open doors and build trust by highlighting the role farmers play in combatting today’s most pressing environmental issues. “Even in 2021, corn farming remains, at its heart, a family operation rooted in the earth,” said John Linder, NCGA President and a farmer from Ohio. “In many cases, such as mine, this vocation goes back multiple generations. America’s family farmers take great pride in the past, but we are working to build a future with healthy soil, clean air and clean water. Whether you live in D.C. or Edison, work in Congress or a tractor cab, we care about the future of our families and want the best for them. Working together, corn farmers can break down the barriers that stand between us and our goals for tomorrow.” This campaign, created by National Corn Growers Association and its state affiliates in collaboration, supports ongoing work in Washington to build relationships based on our many common shared values with authentic stories and backed up by facts. Click here to meet the farmers behind the hands featured in the campaign \"We have a great story - but it has to be told.

The second session in the spring series, this online session, continued this summer’s series in utilizing new technology to keep volunteers active and engaged despite having to remain distant physically. The session's topic gained significant interest as it looked at the impacts of the pandemic on consumer food trends and, thus, on agriculture. During the hour-long session, Center for Food Integrity Consumer Engagement Director Roxi Beck addressed the way consumers choose food has also changed – and the likely demands on the food system shifting consumer needs create. Despite how many things have changed, consumers’ desire to learn more about where food comes from, who is producing it, and the why behind the how remains robust. Over the hour, Beck highlighted the evolution of consumer needs related to food due to COVID-19 – and provided tools and techniques for engaging consumers who think differently than farmers. An additional session on social storytelling is planned for May 19. Sharing their personal stories, the volunteers who make up this grassroots movement foster conversations based on shared values that help moms off the farm discover that they can feel good about the food they feed their families. America’s farm families provide an amazing array of options, but honest questions are understandable with so many competing claims. By serving as resources, these women have shared their unique understanding of important topics, such as the difference between organic and conventional crops and how ranchers care for their animals, more than a billion times since 2010. To find out more about how women are sparking these important conversations and to learn about the participants near you, click here. CommonGround is a grassroots movement to foster conversation among women — on farms and in cities — about where our food comes from.

    "content": "Jon visits the Frazier Kentucky History Museum bourbon exhibit and hears from an 8th generation master distiller. Bourbon is a uniquely American beverage. Not only is its heritage deeply rooted in early Appalachian history, but up to two-and-a-half pounds of corn go into every bottle that’s distilled. So in this episode of the podcast, we’re going on the road with Jon as he pays a visit to the Frazier Kentucky History Museum in Louisville. There, in the midst of the exhibit on bourbon, we’ll learn about the unique way that corn farming contributed to the history of this singular beverage from museum president and CEO Andy Treinen. We'll also follow the crop from kernel to kettle to bottle with 8th generation master distiller Jacob Call from Green River Distilling. And we'll explore how the corn industry and bourbon celebrate their shared history together from Laura Knoth and Adam Andrews from the Kentucky Corn Grower's Association. DIRECT SHARE TRANSCRIPT Andy Treinen: Bourbon is America's only native spirit. 95% of it is made in Kentucky. And 100% of the good stuff is made in Kentucky. Andy Treinen: And that's because of the farmers, that's because of the corn. Jacob Call: Our spec is number two corn but we get number one corn, because that's what they make. So we've just got some superstar farmers. Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host, association CEO, Jon Doggett. You can join Jon every month as he travels the country on a mission to advocate for America's corn farmers. From the fields of the corn belt to the DC beltway, we'll make sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Bourbon is a uniquely American beverage. Not only is its heritage deeply rooted in early Appalachian history, but up to two and a half pounds of corn go into every bottle that's distilled. Dusty Weis: And so in this episode of the podcast, we're going on the road with Jon, as he pays a visit to the Frazier Kentucky History Museum in Louisville. There, in the midst of the exhibit on bourbon, we'll hear from an eighth generation master distiller and explore how the corn industry and bourbon can celebrate their shared history together. But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. Also make sure you follow the NCGA on Twitter @nationalCorn, and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. With that, it's time to once again introduce Jon. Jon Doggett the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. Jon we've talked a lot on this podcast about the many different uses for corn. I don't think that there's corn product that gets people quite as fired up as good old fashioned American bourbon. Certainly it's a topic that I've been looking forward to covering since we launched the show. Jon Doggett: It's taken us a while to get here. COVID has delayed everything for everybody, but when you come to Kentucky, you think about Kentucky basketball, you think about horses, and we're here today to talk about the thing people probably most readily identify that's a part of Kentucky--and that's bourbon. I can't imagine a better place to have this podcast than here in the heart of bourbon country in Kentucky. We are in Louisville, and we are at the museum of bourbon. We have our first guest Museum president and CEO, Andy Treinen, who also creates and hosts much of the museum's bourbon-related programming. Andy, I understand this beautiful museum is the first stop on the Bourbon Trail. Andy Treinen: Well, first of all welcome, great to have all of you here. The Frazier History Museum is where the world meets Kentucky. Kentucky is all about bourbon. We're also the official starting point of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. And that means basically three things. Number one, we have a concierge service downstairs in our welcome center, and it is to help people manage their Kentucky Bourbon Trail experience, because there are so many distillers and there's a lot of time and a lot of money that can be spent. So we really helped to curate everyone's experience. Andy Treinen: The second thing is this gorgeous multimillion dollar bourbon exhibit that we're sitting in right here. And it's about the category of bourbon and why Kentucky owns bourbon. Why 95% of the bourbon in the world is made here in Kentucky. Then the third thing is that, bourbon programming, where I get to host different master distillers from all the different brands and we taste things that people normally don't get an opportunity to taste. And we tell stories like this behind the curtain, kind of some things that people don't normally get to hear. Jon Doggett: Also joining us today from Owensboro, Kentucky is Jacob Call. He is the master distiller at Green River Distilling, that's the fourth largest independent bourbon distillery in the world. And I would guess, you know a little bit about distilling because it's been in your family for a long, long time. Tell us about that, Jacob, and tell us about what you do at Green River. Jacob Call: Thank you all for having me on the show today. It's a privilege to be here. So yeah, I am the master distiller and general manager for the Green River Distillery down in Owensboro, Kentucky. My family has been in the bourbon business for a very long time, and we actually date back to 1791 back in Bourbon County, Kentucky. So, yep, we know a little bit about making bourbon down in Owensboro. Jon Doggett: I always liked talking to folks who have been in a profession or an industry for a number of generations, because that's so important to our farmers. You talk to a farmer and they'll say, I'm a third-generation farmer, fifth-generation farmer, whatever. So thank you for doing that, because it's just so neat that people pick up on something and it becomes an integral part of not only their life, but the life of their family. Thanks so much for being here, look forward to the conversation. Finally, representing the interest of the growers who power this industry in this great state, Executive Director of the Kentucky Corn Growers, Laura Knoth, and Adam Andrews, the program director. Welcome, thanks so much. And this is just a neat thing. Tell us about Kentucky Corn, tell us about your involvement in the bourbon business, not just on the consumption side. And then tell us a little bit about how have you got involved in this museum. Laura Knoth: Absolutely. Thank you Jon. Also glad to have you all here talking about one of our favorite uses for corn and especially Kentucky corn. It's such a unique market for our growers and we've been excited to be participants with the majority of our distilleries here in the state, obviously supplying them with the corn that they need for what we consider to be one of the finest products made from corn. Our history of bourbon is so special here. We have enjoyed our relationship with the Frazier History Museum, as they built this program, this project, it talks about Kentucky agriculture and Kentucky bourbon, and we were proud to partner with them, because they highlighted the real nature of the industry here in our state, and the impact that it has on corn production and the economy that it creates for our state. So we were proud to partner with them and our board members that were excited. They were able to provide information about how their farms have been providing corn to the bourbon industry for generations as well. Jon Doggett: That's pretty cool. Adam? Adam Andrews: From me as well, thank you for coming down. Thank you for putting this on your tour of, Wherever Jon May Roam. I've been excited and enjoyed seeing the bourbon industry grow in Kentucky over the last decade or so, just Rickhouses popping up everywhere, direct relationships with farms and distilleries, and our availability, our ability to bring bourbon to the corn pack every year and dissipate as the nation spokesperson from a corn perspective for bourbon. And it's overwhelming sometimes. Jon Doggett: Tough job there. Adam Andrews: Tough job, but it's a very high-profile use of corn. And it's an easy way to start a good conversation with consumers and people who are interested. Because agriculture sometimes is losing its connection with society, as we become more urban and things like that. This is still something that is easily identifiable with consumers and a great platform for good conversations. Jon Doggett: That's so important. If they can have that touchpoint on one part of the industry, you can draw concentric circles around that and have all sorts of great conversations and discussions. By the way, before we go any further, I do have to mention that Adam and Laura and I, all share a common background, we all work for farm bureau. They work for Kentucky Farm Bureau, I work with the American Farm Bureau. I remember years and year ago, I was sent out to Kentucky and they said, \"You're going to go on this tour. And this young woman...\" I think she was just out of high school, \"... Will take you around.\" Laura Knoth: Back in early '90s. Jon Doggett: Was back in the '90s. Laura Knoth: '90s. Jon Doggett: Yeah. When you graduated. It was one of the best weeks I had at the American Farm Bureau. We went from one end of the state to the other, and we went to your family's place. And that was a lot of fun. Then of course, after a while, Adam showed up and I got to know him. So then we all went to corn together too. It's kind of neat. Adam Andrews: Yeah. Our tenures at farm bureau overlapped about six months, that was National Affairs Director of Kentucky. And my first congressional tour, Laura was my boss. The latter time that I was there at farm bureau, but first congressional tour, you were the very first update for our group, and it was on the RFS as it was just coming out in early 2004. Jon Doggett: Boy, that's a long time ago. Dusty Weis: Jon, we have yet to meet anybody in the course of this podcast that doesn't have a story like that about you though. So they just keep coming. Jon Doggett: The nice thing about it is, so far they have all kept the stories to be the reasonable and rational ones that I don't get embarrassed over. All right. Moving along, the common thread that is woven through all of your comments, it's a heritage here, this is a heritage thing. So much of agriculture it's heritage, it's not only what the dad do, but what my grandparents and my great-grandparents and my great, great grandparents do. Jacob, talk about, what is it not only to your family, but where do you see that replicated with other people in the industry, and how important is that to your connection with consumers? Jacob Call: Yeah. We take a lot of pride being from Kentucky, being an eighth-generation Kentucky, and also an eighth-generation farmer myself in Kentucky. I think a lot of the master distillers in the industry, there's just a lot of state pride that we share, good comradery with everyone. We're proud to represent Kentucky to the world. We're kind of the spokespeople for this great state. So it's part of our job we think. Dusty Weis: Being an eighth-generation master distiller, was there ever any doubt in your mind growing up that that was what you were going to do? Did you ever go to your dad and be like, \"I think I want to be a firefighter.\" Jacob Call: Actually I went to Murray State down in Western Kentucky, and my first job, I was actually a banker for a while. My dad was like, \"Now, you're going to go get some other experience, first.\" Nothing should be given in this world anyway. So first job was a banker and I had all of the less glamorous jobs in college, worked on the bottling line and fermentation. And we had a cattle ranch that was actually a Florida distillers for awhile. We had a cattle ranch down in Florida, took care of all our cows and fed our byproducts to our cattle. When talk about that a little bit later, that's one of our other ways that we touch agriculture and Kentucky is with our by-product. Jon Doggett: Andy, let's start at the beginning. Why did we start making bourbon? And why do we start making bourbon in Kentucky of all places? Andy Treinen: You mentioned Jon, that heritage, we like to describe it as authenticity. When Congress in 1964 said that bourbon is America's only native spirit, and people often say, \"Bourbon has to be made in Kentucky.\" That's not true, it has to be made in America. 95% of it is made in Kentucky, and 100% of the good stuff is made in Kentucky. That's because of the farmers, that's because of the corn. It started back, there were a lot of rye distillers that came from the East and they were incentivized by government to move West and to plant corn and to build a structure. With that, they were given 400 acres of land. Distillers, generally use what product is the best in that area as the primary product in what it is that they're distilling in the state of Kentucky, that is corn. It was called the Corn Patch and Cabin Right's Act that gave folks 400 acres when they moved to the Kentucky area, that wasn't called Kentucky at the time. And they grew some corn and build a little structure. Jon Doggett: That's interesting. My family came from Virginia to this state about that time. Now nobody talks about whether they made whiskey or not, but- Andy Treinen: They're all making whiskey. Jon Doggett: I'm sure they were all making whiskey. Andy Treinen: But there was some policy behind it, I think is the important thing, and we are rich with corn in the state of Kentucky. Jon Doggett: Continue with that Andy. Why is it called bourbon? Andy Treinen: Well, there are a lot of different accounts of that, and I don't know that anybody has completely nailed it. Jon Doggett: What's your favorite version of this? Andy Treinen: I think it probably comes from what was Bourbon County, which was a lot bigger than Bourbon County now. The barrels were stamped with Bourbon County and shipped down the river and ended up in New Orleans. And people started saying, \"Send us more of that bourbon whiskey from Bourbon County.\" After that, bourbon is in the barrel and on the river for an undetermined amount of time and into and out of the wood, it gets better. People love what the wood does to it, and that gives it a most of its color, most of its flavor. And they were getting a product down there that was different than when it was put in the barrel here, and they desired more and they said, \"Send us more bourbon.\" That's my favorite account. Dusty Weis: For the uneducated, when we're talking about bourbon, all bourbon is a whiskey, but not all whiskey is a bourbon. So what makes it a bourbon per se? Andy Treinen: Well, there are very clear definitions. First of all, it has to be made in the United States of America, and it has to be distilled at no more than 160 proof. It has to be bottled at no more than 125 proof. Corn is the secret recipe, it has to have as a mash bill more than 51% corn. It has to be aged in new oak barrels. Outside of those things, it is not bourbon. There's no, obviously, and I think most of your listeners know this, but there's nothing added to bourbon, you can't add any flavor, you can't add any color. The only thing that changes the nuance of what is distilled is how long it spends in those barrels and what happens in the barrels by the variance of temperature and time. Jon Doggett: Jacob Call, master distiller at Green River Distilling, talk about the process from the farm to the glass. Jacob Call: Sure. It all starts with grain. What we do is we'll go out and we contract our corn really on an annual basis. We buy direct from the farmer under contract. Multiple farmers in our area, all Kentucky corn, very important for us to buy Kentucky corn, and we test that corn. So the trucks arrive on our site, we have grain bins, we test it for bushel way, for moisture, for material, and most importantly for us, odor. We don't want any kind of off odor notes in our corn because it'll carry through the entire process. If you have musty corn, you'll have musty bourbon four or five years later. So we mill that grain, we mill it to a flour type consistency. We also use rye and malted barley in our recipes, sometimes we use wheat, we do buy Kentucky wheat also. Jacob Call: From that point, we'll take that grain, we add water and we cook it. We heat it up to around 212 degrees and that's going to break all the starch down. Then we cool it to 148, and we add our malted barley. And the malt has a natural enzyme that's going to convert the starch to sugar. At that point we cool it again, we send it to fermentation where we add yeast, we have a proprietary yeast blend that we use. In fermentation the yeast are going to eat the sugar, they're going to turn it into alcohol. It's going to be about an 8% alcohol year at that point. Jacob Call: From there, we will distill that beer, so we're going to strip the alcohol out of the grain. It's going to ferment for about a three-day process. When we start distilling, we distill about 300 barrels a day at our facility, and we go through two distillations. We do first initial distillation of 120 proof and our beer still, we have a 54 inch beer still. Then from there we distill it a second time in our copper doubler at 138 proof. From there, we cut it to a 120 and we barrel it at 120 proof. Then that's where it goes and soaks up some of that magical Kentucky climate that makes great Kentucky bourbon whiskey. Jon Doggett: One of the things about the climate is, it cold, hot, cold, hot makes the bourbon move around through the barrel, and that's what gives it the taste. Jacob Call: Yeah. So in Kentucky we have all four seasons sometimes in the same day, it seems like. And yeah, the bourbon is moving in and out of that barrel, the barrel acts as a filter. So all of the color from the bourbon will come from the barrel, starts out clear, and then it just gets darker as it ages in that barrel. And then age is differently on different floors or levels of your warehouse. Your upper floors get a lot hotter, so you'll have a higher proof product, it'll age a little bit faster. Your lower floors, a little bit slower maturation, kind of like scotch. So your ten-year-old stuff, 18-year-old stuff will be on your lower levels generally. Jon Doggett: I didn't realize that there was a difference in where you put the barrel in the warehouse, that's cool. Jacob Call: Yeah. There's all sorts of nuances that go into it. Laura Knoth: This is what's so great about being able to talk with folks like Jacob Call who is a master distiller and being able to hear him explain the magic. I mean the Bourbon Trail is so fascinating because of being able to go through the distillery and see how that happens. Tours happen all the time every day and you can see that process, but to hear somebody like Jacob describe it, that's a treat. Jon Doggett: Doing a little studying before we did the podcast, it's a real simple, complex process. It just takes grain, water, oak barrel, little yeast, little malt barley. It's easy, but it isn't. Dusty Weis: Till as old as time there. But Andy, before, when you were describing sort of the ABCs of what constitutes a bourbon, it hasn't always been done that way, it hasn't always been so regimented. There was a time there when making bourbon in Kentucky was a little bit Wild West. Can you tell us about that and how did the federal government step in and intervene there to save Kentucky bourbon? Andy Treinen: Yeah. It's an interesting question because the first-ever government policy on any product, any food, anything, was whiskey. The Bottled-in-Bond Act guaranteed that what you were getting was safe, and what you thought you were buying. Before that, production was done into big barrels and people did all kinds of things to try to maximize their profits. So there could be tobacco juice in there, there could be different flavorings and colorings. And so the government stepped in with the Bottled-in-Bond Act to make sure that, that was a safe product, and that what you bought was in a bottled. Forester was the first ever to actually bottle bourbon, as opposed to getting it in a jug at the saloon. Dusty Weis: I wouldn't mind getting some bourbon in a jug to be honest. Andy Treinen: True. You just want to even through consumer protection, you want to make sure you're getting good, safe bourbon. Obviously during prohibition, there were all kinds of speaking of the Wild Wild West, everything got cut loose again. And it helped to tell the story of why regulation of these products is important. Otherwise you end up with unsafe products and people walking around with jag leg and crime, unintended consequences of prohibition was crime boosted big time. Jon Doggett: But Dusty see me after Neil turns the cameras off. Laura Knoth: Well in here in the museum, you can see some examples of the older bottles and the way they looked. Andy's got quite a collection of some of the old stuff, it's fascinating. Andy Treinen: Thank you. My favorite bottle in there is an old Forester bottled in 1896, and it looks like it was bottled yesterday. It is clean and looks like an outstanding product, but then there are some other ones that have turned and there are some variances certainly in a lot of those bottles. But it's again, it's that authentic story and why we're sitting here in Kentucky telling this story this morning at the official starting point of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. It starts with these natural products, corn, the most important of them, and ends up with something that whether you are a consumer or whether you drink bourbon or not, most people in Kentucky are proud of the fact that this is Kentucky's authentic story. Jon Doggett: Laura, you and I have talked in the past about the pride that so many your growers have in producing corn for this industry. How has that evolved over the last 10, 15, 20 years? Laura Knoth: We're just so excited to see the growth in the bourbon industry. It has just really taken off, and like Jacob was describing, they want the best quality corn they can get to make the best quality bourbon. And so our growers, many of them have generations that have delivered direct to distilleries across the state and, they're proud of that. And it's something they're proud to make sure that we produce about a million and a half acres and 200 and something million bushels. About 20 million of those go to the distilling industry in this state. We're proud of every one of them and those farmers are too. So they know it's got to be the top quality to deliver to the distillery. It's a specialty market and they're proud of it. Jon Doggett: Jacob Call, tell us what is the mash bill? And how do we pay it? Jacob Call: The mash bill is the recipe. It's the recipe that we use to make bourbon. As was mentioned earlier, it has to have at least 51% corn in the recipe or the mash bill. We run a variety of mash bills. Sort of our go-to is a 70% corn, 21% rye and 9% malted barley. And we run higher corn mash bills, we run a 78% corn, and the corn portion of that gives it a lot of the sweetness. So the sweetness from bourbon comes from the corn, the spice and the pepper notes will come from the rye, and then the malt do get some of those creamier notes from the malted barley, but that's really used also as an enzyme conversion to convert that starch to sugar. A lot of different distilleries run different mash bills, but generally speaking, there'll be in the 70% corn to 78% corn on average. Jon Doggett: When you're at that 70, 75% corn in the mash bill, let's see, there's 53 gallons in a barrel? Jacob Call: Yeah. Jon Doggett: How many bushel, does that represent? Jacob Call: That'd be about nine bushels, roughly for a barrel, depending on the ratio in the mash bill. Jon Doggett: Okay. Laura, they make the bourbon, what else do they make and why is that important to this state? Laura Knoth: Absolutely. What's great about the bourbon being a use for corn is, they get the sugar and turn that into bourbon. And then the crushed grain, the spent grain, the stillage I think some of them call it different things, but the distillers grains are what is left from the product. They've taken all the sugar out of it, but it leaves all the protein and all the carbs are left there for one of the best feed products that you could have. So dried distillers grains, a lot of folks who are in ethanol world understand that DDGs. Well, it originally came from the bourbon industry, distillers grains. And so that is used for livestock feed as well. One of the great things that Jacob does is he uses some of his in livestock. His operation is very diverse, the Green River Distilling Company is, they're out there, they're quite a bit on the cutting edge of a lot of production and a lot of usage. So distiller's grains are an important product from the distilling industry. Jacob Call: It has been for decades and decades, livestock producers around Central Kentucky had been using distillers grains before ethanol industry really introduced it in the Midwest. There were 150 dairies in each county years ago. And the bourbon industry was integral to their feeding schedules, feeding rations. Dusty Weis: California claims to have the happiest cows around. But I can't imagine a happier cow than one that's just nom and down some bourbon mash. Jacob Call: A lot of distilleries, they have big dryer houses where they'll make those DDGs, dry those grain. Some of the midsize ones like us, we don't have a dryer house, so we have what we call whole stillage and we give that away to farmers for cattle feed. We've got about 50 or so local farmers that we provide that free cattle feed to. We also have about a thousand acre farm that we own ourselves and outside of Owensboro, We have our own cattle that we feed, our stillage too. So we touch agriculture in a lot of different ways. Andy Treinen: It's interesting. One of the that's one of many aftermarket products that the bourbon industry has given birth to. The other are these barrels we talk about, for a bourbon barrel, it has to be never used before. Now, all the other less superior products all around the world like rum and tequila and scotch are using our old bourbon barrels because they can use them a second, a third and a fourth time. But for Kentucky bourbon first-time barrels only. So those barrels are actually worth more after they're used than they often are paid for in the first time around. Jon Doggett: I know I've bought a few of those and I think probably everybody's bought a few of those over the years. So that's interesting, you only use it one time. Adam Andrews, program director for Kentucky Corn. Talk about what's unique to Kentucky, the soil structure, the soil types. How does Kentucky corn fit into the Kentucky bourbon business from the seed to the finished product? Adam Andrews: Best way to describe our soil type is diverse. You can cross a field into half a dozen soil types. We don't have very square fields influenced by a lot of waterways, we've got the largest number of stream miles in Continental United States in our state. One thing that I don't know if it's been brought up quite yet, the limestone. We've got a very high limestone content, that's one thing that makes bourbon very unique. And it's one reason that the bourbon production was settled here, because we can start with limestone water and the unique filtration process and taste of limestone. The difficult corners of the field and things like that, make it a challenge to produce corn sometimes compared to some our more Midwestern counterparts. The implementation of precision technology is much more difficult here. You have to have segments set off much more quickly, or you're going to overlap on a finger of a field and things like that. Adam Andrews: So yeah, a lot of the technology to develop a precision technology, precision application back in the '90s, early 2000s was developed here in Kentucky because we were the most difficult. That guy that developed that was hired off to another state but, we've had a lot of unique challenges. It's, not as simple here sometimes. Well, John McGillicutty laughs that everybody accuses him of being able to spill a bag of seed corn and make 200 bushels in Iowa. And he laughs and says, \"We can spill seed corn on concrete and make 200 bushels.\" And we have challenges, we have to deal with slopes. No till was invented here, we say. Some other folks try to claim that, but we know what happened. And a lot of our state is no till. In the '90s and the upper '90s at some points, I think some minimum till practices have taken a couple of those percentage points, but it's a very unique state to produce corn in. Jon Doggett: Again and again, where we're talking about relationships from the farmer to the distiller, to the consumer. Laura, what's the relationship between the folks you represent and the folks in the distillery business, in this state? Laura Knoth: The relationships between our growers and distillery are always unique. And we've laughed over time that every distillery, just Jacob, just so you know, we consider you all a little bit of a cagey crew, a little bit of a cagey banch, you don't like to share any secrets. You don't tell growers exactly what you're looking for, but you know it when you see it. What's exciting about that is it has given our young farmers in this state some great opportunities, because they're willing to go the extra mile, especially to develop a relationship. And so where they're wanting to bring that into the operation where their dad's like, \"Yeah, it's tough to sell those distilleries.\" That's a great challenge for our young farmers. It has given a lot of our young guys some greater opportunities than they would have had otherwise. Jon Doggett: Jacob Call, how do you view that relationship and what makes it so special and unique for you folks? Jacob Call: I think we have a great relationship with the corn farmers. We try to work together on projects and different things. We've got some heirloom varieties that we work on, white corn, blue, corn, organic corn. We experiment, a lot of experimentation right now in the bourbon industry. But, for me down in Western Kentucky, it's very comforting to know that we grow some of the best corn in the state. We have very fertile soils down with the Green River and Ohio River in that area. Our spec is number two corn, but we get number one corn because that's what they make. So we just got some superstar farmers down in our part of the state. Jon Doggett: Well, it's certainly fitting that a beverage that's meant to be enjoyed with friends has such a neat history about bringing people together in other ways. It's a pleasure to be here, to sit with you here at the Frazier Kentucky History Museum, and learn about the history of bourbon. But coming up next month, we're going to continue this discussion. We're going to look at bourbon's present and its future. So you'll have to tune in again, next time for the rest of this conversation. Thank you so much to Andy Treinen, Frazier Museum president and CEO, Jacob Call master distiller at Green River Distilling, Laura Knoth and Adam Andrews from the Kentucky Corn Growers Association.

    "title": "Mental Health on the Farm Podcast Explores Resources, Offers Support",
    "content": "This spring, radio stations across rural America joined Commodity Classic to highlight an issue important to all of us in the corn family - managing the mental health issues facing farmers and rural America. As you are aware, we face challenging times in society due to COVID. On the farm, things had been amplified by six years of tough economic conditions before the pandemic, and its changes emerged on the horizon. To raise awareness, NCGA is offering access to a podcast created from the original program. Highlighting real stories as well as resources, the podcast shares reassurance that those feeling the stress are not alone and that there are resources to help. To download or listen to the podcast, please click here. The podcast features mental health practitioners and counselors with strong ties to the farm and real-life perspectives on the issue from farmers Jason Meadows and NCGA Member and Consumer Engagement Action Team Chair Lowell Neitzel. Neitzel, who farms in Kansas, says mental health is a very important topic after watching his father suffer for years with depression, dealing with depression and anxiety himself and seeing fellow farmers struggling as well. “You know, as farmers, we're supposed to be these tough guys. We just run hard all the time, and nothing can take us down. But, you know, we have so much worry and so much stuff on the plate that sometimes we can't handle it all at once. It is refreshing to have people I look to in my community as role models and leaders to say, ‘hey, I've been in your position too, and it was really eye-opening and nice to hear that they'd been in my situation too and I wasn't alone.’”",

    "title": "Biofuels Coalition Readies for Oral Arguments in Supreme Court",
    "content": "In oral arguments scheduled for Tuesday morning, four agriculture and biofuel organizations will argue that the U.S. Supreme Court should affirm a unanimous 2020 decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which held that only small refineries that have remained continuously exempt from obligations under the Renewable Fuel Standard are eligible for future extensions of the compliance exemption. The four organizations comprising the Biofuels Coalition—the Renewable Fuels Association, the National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, and the American Coalition for Ethanol—will share time during Tuesday’s oral arguments with the U.S. Department of Justice, which will be representing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. EPA announced in February that it supports the Tenth Circuit’s decision. “EPA had exceeded its authority by creating new exemptions when the statute only authorizes the agency to extend the temporary, time-limited exemption that Congress provided to small refineries. Because none of the three refineries involved in this case still had that exemption, there was nothing for EPA to extend,” the coalition noted. “The Tenth Circuit Court’s ruling is consistent with the Clean Air Act, congressional intent, and the purpose of the RFS. We will continue to stand up for the farmers and renewable fuel producers across the country whose livelihoods have been harmed by abuse of the refinery exemption program. We look forward to presenting our arguments before the Supreme Court, and we believe the Tenth Circuit decision should be affirmed.” While the statute does allow EPA to grant exemption extensions to small refineries that can prove compliance with the RFS will cause “disproportionate economic harm,” the coalition underscored in its March 24 brief that the exemption was clearly meant to be a temporary allowance only. The statute only authorizes continuous extensions of the temporary exemption that Congress granted to all small refineries at the start of the RFS program; once a refiner comes into compliance with the RFS, they no longer are eligible to receive an exemption. Matthew W. Morrison, Partner, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, will represent the Biofuels Coalition in Tuesday’s oral arguments, which will air live on C-SPAN, starting at 10 a.m. EDT. Audio and transcripts of the proceedings will be made available on the Supreme Court website. Click here for all documents related to the case, HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining, LLC, et al. v. Renewable Fuels Association, et al. (No. 20-472).",

    "title": "NCGA Supports Reintroduction of Senate Climate Policy Legislation",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) applauds the bipartisan reintroduction of the Growing Climate Solutions Act, sponsored by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.). The bill passed out of the Senate Ag Committee this morning. The bipartisan legislation addresses the potential for agriculture to serve as a critical climate solution by making it easier for producers to participate in climate-smart practices, navigate carbon markets and earn extra income through carbon sequestration. “NCGA thanks the Senators for their leadership and recognition of agriculture’s role as a solution to solving climate change,” said NCGA President John Linder. “Corn farmers continue to be leaders in this space and are always adopting practices that improve the quality of the soil, water, and air around our farms. We look forward to working together on this legislation and others that support voluntary, market and incentive-based policies.” The Growing Climate Solutions Act would ensure agricultural producers and forest owners of all sizes looking to enter the carbon market for the first time have access to reliable information, qualified technical service providers and third-party verifiers. In addition, the bill establishes a robust USDA advisory council composed of farmers, scientists and other climate stakeholders. Sens. Stabenow and Braun were joined by 34 co-sponsors of the bill. NCGA is one of 60 agricultural and environmental organizations in support of the bill.",

    "content": "Spring has sprung and the growing season is upon us! This Earth Day, the National Corn Growers Association is celebrating the third annual national campaign to promote pollinator health best management practices through BeSure!. “Making sure farmers have access to the best and most up-to-date information is why NCGA has been a part of the BeSure! campaign from the beginning,” said NCGA Director of Biotechnology and Crop Inputs Nicole Hasheider. “With planting season underway across the country, it’s a great time for farmers to again consider how they can help protect important pollinators around their fields.” The benefits of neonicotinoid seed treatments in protecting corn seeds from early-season pests are well documented. But farmers and applicators can protect both their crop and pollinators and other wildlife by following a few simple guidelines. For Growers: Follow directions on the label for appropriate storage, use and disposal practices. When planting treated seed, use advanced seed flow lubricants that minimize dust. Additionally, when planting treated seed, eliminate flowering plants and weeds in and around the field prior to planting. For foliar applications, ensure that sprays are directed away from any flowering plants, follow established buffer zones, and calibrate equipment to minimize spray drift. Before making an application, be aware of any honeybees and hives near the field and communicate with neighboring beekeepers prior to treatment. Remove and properly dispose of all treated seed. Keep all treated seed out of commodity grain channels. For Applicators: Comply with all regulations when using registered pesticide products and ensure proper employee training prior to application. Apply best management practices when using treated seed, soil drenches or foliar sprays to minimize dust or spray drift. Establish written protocols using best practices to ensure high-quality seed treatment, foliar or field application. Adopt stewardship documentation for the full life cycle of seed treatment products. Properly discard any unused product, rinse water or seed treatment by following the label disposal instructions to minimize any potential environmental impact. Ensure that all required and pertinent neonicotinoid treatment information, consistent with the product label, is conveyed to customers. To learn more about best management practices to protect both crops and pollinators while handling neonicotinoid products, visit BeSure!, powered by the Growing Matters coalition and in conjunction with the American Seed Trade Association (ASTA), the National Pesticide Safety Education Center (NPSEC), the National Corn Growers Association, the American Soybean Association, CropLife America and the Agricultural Retailers Association.",

    "title": "NCGA Submits Comments to EPA on E15 Fuel Dispenser Labeling and Underground Storage Tanks",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) today submitted comments to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed rule to update fuel pump labeling for E15 and improve the process for retailers to demonstrate compatibility of their equipment so they can offer higher ethanol blends. “As producers of the primary feedstock for ethanol, corn growers support expanding availability of higher ethanol blends such as E15, an immediate, available, and affordable solution to lowering carbon emissions in transportation,” NCGA President John Linder wrote in the organization’s comments. “Finalizing this proposal will remove additional barriers to retailers offering E15 and provide an immediate fuel decarbonization opportunity.” Updating EPA’s fuel pump label and supporting compliance demonstration for underground storage tanks (USTs) will benefit both consumers and retailers. NCGA’s comments urged EPA to adopt proposed updates to the E15 label and make further revisions to the label statement to keep it fact-based and avoid speculation and confusion. “NCGA believes the E15 label must clearly and factually inform consumers which vehicles E15 is safe and approved for use in and identify the limited engines in which E15 is not approved for use. Because more than 95 percent of light duty vehicles on the road today are 2001 and newer and can use E15, the label should inform consumers that E15 is safe for use in their vehicles,” stated Linder. “EPA is not only proposing changes to E15 fuel labeling requirements but is also seeking input to revise and streamline methods for retailers demonstrating UST equipment compatibility. As NCGA’s comments noted, equipment compatibility has not been an issue for retailers because an extensive amount of equipment is fully compatible with E15 and higher blends, but demonstrating compatibility has been an issue. Through NCGA and state corn grower associations, farmers have invested their resources in support of biofuels infrastructure. “We appreciate EPA’s proposals to expand options for UST owners and operators to meet compatibility requirements and the forward-looking proposal for new UST systems and replacement equipment and components to be compatible with up to 100 percent ethanol, cost-effectively future-proofing UST investments for changing fuel markets and new, low carbon fuel choices. “We urge EPA to expand the allowances for already compatible equipment to do more to make compatibility demonstration less burdensome for retailers that want to offer consumers greater choice and value and meet the objective of allowing E15 use with existing compatible infrastructure. Listing these tanks and piping is a good first step, but EPA must ensure the greatest possible extent of equipment known to be compatible is included in the final rule,” the submitted comments went on the say.

Consider Corn Challenge II winner Derek Wells, CEO and founder of ExoPolymer, participated in the webinar to share his experience of the process and the benefits he’s received from participating in the Challenge. “As we were starting our company, having that discretionary funding available was very, very helpful in the beginning,” Wells told participants. “And a little bit more important, as we evolved the company here, are the agricultural network connections in the Midwest that the corn growers provided to us. Being out here in California as a startup company, we don't have a lot of insight into all the interesting things that are happening out in the Midwest, especially with regard to fermentation capacity.” Specific application areas being considered for this Challenge include: Biobased materials from novel mixes of corn-derived plastics Compostable plastics with high tensile strength, such as netting or packaging materials Heavy-duty fuels or drop-in chemicals (e.g., sustainable aviation fuel; biodiesel derived from corn glucose, bunker fuel, etc.) Carbon fiber Other high-value molecules Submissions are due on June 3, 2021, at 4:00 PM CDT. A total prize pool of U.S. $150,000 will be split equally between one to six winners, based on the strength of competing submissions.

    "content": "The American Jobs Plan, the Biden Administration’s $2 trillion infrastructure proposal, includes several provisions directly impacting corn growers. Rural Americans rely on reliable and safe infrastructure to compete in the global marketplace, and access to a fast, reliable broadband connection is critical for all Americans. Technology is a part of nearly every aspect of the farming operation, allowing farmers to be more efficient and sustainable on their operations. But, 14 million Americans living in rural communities lack access to reliable internet. The Biden plan proposes $100 billion to expand high-speed internet to enable 100 percent access across the entire country. This proposal will prioritize support for broadband networks owned, operated by, or affiliated with local governments, non-profits, and cooperatives. This will also reduce the cost of broadband internet service and promote more widespread adoption. The broadband industry supports jobs in rural America and is critical to the future of rural communities. Broadband represents the critical link that enables telemedicine, precision agriculture, teleworking, distance learning and economic development in rural areas. Congress will ultimately decide, and vote on, the provisions included in any infrastructure legislation. Discussions on Capitol Hill regarding an infrastructure package are currently taking place, and NCGA is sharing corn farmer priorities with members of the House and Senate.",

    "title": "RFA, Growth Energy and NCGA Defend Year-Round E15 in Court",
    "content": "Today, the D.C. Circuit Court will hear oral arguments in American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, et al. vs. EPA, a case in which oil refiners challenge the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2019 rulemaking that paved the way for the year-round sale of E15. As intervenors in the case, the Renewable Fuels Association, Growth Energy and the National Corn Growers Association will also argue in support of upholding the E15 rule in court today. In a joint statement, RFA, Growth Energy and NCGA said, \"Oil refiners are simply trying to reclaim more market share by blocking American drivers from year-round access to a more affordable, lower-carbon fuel at the pump. Studies have repeatedly shown that the volatility of E15 is lower than that of E10. And other recent studies find that a nationwide switch from E10 to E15 would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions –equivalent to removing approximately 3.85 million vehicles from the road. If the refiners had their way and this rule was overturned, both volatile emissions and greenhouse gas emissions would increase. EPA’s E15 rule should be upheld because it is consistent with Congressional intent and the Clean Air Act, good for the environment, good for the rural communities that rely on a strong biofuels industry, and good for American drivers who want more options at the pump.” Background In June 2019, EPA issued its final rule extending the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) volatility waiver to E15 and found that E15 is substantially similar to E10 certification fuel, allowing its introduction into commerce by fuel manufacturers without the need for a separate E15 waiver. These actions allowed for the sale of E15 fuels year-round. Oil refiners are now challenging the rulemaking in an attempt to undermine the expansion of biofuels in our nation’s fuel supply. On August 21, 2020, RFA, Growth Energy and NCGA filed a brief as intervenors in the oil industry’s lawsuit against EPA’s regulation allowing year-round E15. The brief provided strong support for EPA’s position that parity in RVP regulations for E10 and E15 is consistent with the provisions of the Clean Air Act and the congressional intent behind those provisions. The organizations further pointed out that extending the volatility waiver from E10 to E15 is appropriate because the volatility of the fuel actually decreases as more ethanol is added into gasoline beyond E10.

    "title": "The Value of Corn in the Pet Food Industry",
    "content": "April 11 is National Pet Day. There are many benefits to including corn in your pet’s diet, but have you ever wondered about the benefits that your cat or dog brings to the corn industry? In November a comprehensive study unpacked the $30 billion U.S. retail pet food industry, thanks to the Institute for Feed Education and Research (IFEEDER), the Pet Food Institute and the North American Renderers Association. The study found that corn and corn gluten meal are the top two most used plant-based ingredients in pet food products. Corn is the dominant plant-based carbohydrate at 1,283,674 tons, and corn gluten meal is the dominant plant-based protein ingredient at 476,649 tons used on an annual basis. Thanks to Fido and Fluffy, the corn industry moved 1,958,061 tons of product, valued at a total of $438 million. “Farmers and farm-product processors sell $6.9 billion worth of products to pet food manufacturers every year that are used as ingredients. Sales made by farmers and processors of farm products to pet food manufacturers stimulates further upstream economic activity, leading to the purchase of $5.3 billion of materials and services from farm suppliers providing necessary inputs such as seed, fertilizer, fuel, labor, machinery and repairs to produce high-quality products that are used as pet food ingredients,” cites the report. Founded in 2009 by the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA), IFEEDER supports critical education and research initiatives that assure consumers a safe, healthy and sustainable food supply. The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) partners with IFEEDER and the AFIA on research projects as well as feed and food industry efforts, such as the Association of American Feed Control Officials’ petition on Corn Gluten Meal and the current partnership on the U.S. Roundtable on Sustainable Beef Feed Task Force. “This first-of-its-kind research shows that there are nearly 550 diverse ingredients used in U.S. pets’ diets to provide complete and balanced nutrition at price points that fit shoppers’ budgets,” said Robert Cooper, IFEEDER’s executive director. “Collaborations on research like the pet food study allow us to leverage our resources and share information that helps allied organizations, like the National Corn Growers Association, amplify its outreach with decision-makers and consumer influencers, so they are more informed about how important commodities, such as corn, are in producing safe and nutritious food for both humans and their four-legged companions.” Link to the full Pet Food Production and Ingredient Analysis study here.

    "title": "Follow the Science: How Farm Country Can Beat COVID-19, with the National Rural Health Association",
    "content": "Rural America faces unique challenges when it comes to beating COVID-19, and vaccination will play a vital role in winning the battle. Two and a half million Americans are getting their COVID-19 vaccine every day. And as America takes this critical step to beating the virus and re-opening the economy, it’s more important than ever that rural America does NOT get left behind. So the NCGA has joined a nationwide effort to support that process, the COVID-19 Community Corps. Together with other founding members, NCGA will promote the science behind the safe and effective vaccines that are a critical component in the battle against Coronavirus. In this episode, we talk about the unique challenges we face in getting rural Americans vaccinated with Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, and Carrie Saia, the CEO of a small-town hospital in Holton, Kansas. DIRECT SHARE TRANSCRIPT Alan Morgan: You understand how science plays a role within agriculture, and you understand that you need to follow the science. There is a coherent reason of why this vaccine is safe and effective at this time. Carrie Saia: My dad was a farmer. I helped him give vaccines on our farm. He would have been first in line to receive the vaccine. Dusty Weis: Welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis and I'll be introducing your host, association CEO, Jon Doggett. You can join Jon every month as he travels the country on a mission to advocate for America's corn farmers. From the fields of the corn belt to the DC beltway, we'll make sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them, with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Two and a half million Americans are getting their COVID-19 vaccine every day. And as America takes this critical step to beating the virus and reopening the economy, it's more important than ever that rural America does not get left behind. Dusty Weis: The NCGA has joined a nationwide effort to support that process. And this week we'll be talking to the National Rural Health Association and the CEO of a small-town hospital in Kansas, about what it takes to finally close the book on Coronavirus. But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. That way you can take us with you on your truck, your tractor, on your next trip and never miss an update. Also make sure to follow the NCGA on Twitter at National Corn, sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. Dusty Weis: And with that it's time to once again introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association and Jon throughout the COVID 19 pandemic, disruption, tragedy, and heartbreak have been a daily presence in our lives. But as always, America has been able to count on our growers power through and get the job done. And our hats are off to farmers for the way that they've performed over the last year. However, there is hopefully a light at the end of the tunnel now. Two and a half million Americans are getting their COVID vaccine every day, case numbers and deaths have been dropping. Although now we're seeing a slight uptick as well, and we're hoping to do something about that. And it's finally possible to look at the year ahead and see a time when this virus isn't in the headlines every day. Jon Doggett: Dusty, if we learned one thing in 2020, it's that rural America is not immune to a pandemic, but we face unique challenges when it comes to rural health care, particularly when it relates to distributing and administering the coronavirus vaccine. Having this vaccine available gives all of us some hope that we're going to be able to return to something close to normal in the near future, but we're not there yet. And so we're going to be talking about what needs to happen to get more vaccines in more arms in rural America and how to get folks there, the protection that they deserve. Dusty Weis: But Jon, before we introduce our guests here, I understand that we have a little bit of news to break about the NCGA's role in fighting the coronavirus. I understand that we've received an invitation direct from the White House to become founding members of America's COVID 19 Community Corps. How did that come about and what does it mean for our members? Jon Doggett: Well, the COVID 19 community core it's a program that's administered through the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And it's to share science-based information directly with community organizations and Americans across the country to help them deliver the message that COVID-19 can be taken care of with vaccines. And we have to share that importance of vaccines throughout the communities across this country. And becoming members of the COVID-19 Community Corps makes this conversation we're having today even more important. Joining us today is Alan Morgan, he is the CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a national nonprofit with more than 21,000 members. The Association's mission is to provide leadership on rural health issues, through advocacy, communications, education, and research. Jon Doggett: Also with us is Carrie Saia. She is the CEO of Holton Community Hospital in Holton, Kansas. That's in the Northeast part of the state, North of Topeka, Northwest of Kansas City. Thank you both for joining us on the NCGA podcast. And I'd like to start with learning a little bit more about both of you, where you come from, how you got to, where you're at, and your work in rural health care. And so I'm going to start, Alan with you. Alan Morgan: Thanks, Jon. I appreciate joining everyone today. This is particularly exciting for me because I've been involved with health policy for 30 years, been with the National Rural Health Association for the last 20. But this is the first time that I've been able to do an interview with Carrie because I'm actually from Holton Kansas myself. And so, know the community and being able to watch a lot of success that Carrie's been having in her hometown when it comes to COVID. It's just a great opportunity to come together and talk about how rural communities are facing this challenge together. Jon Doggett: And Carrie, how about you? Carrie Saia: I started off my career looking in the nursing arena and was an emergency nurse, exciting job as a flight nurse for a couple of years, but the majority has all been in Northeast Kansas. I had the opportunity in 2008 to come back and help manage my hometown hospital. And have loved every minute and every aspect of rural healthcare. 2012 was asked to take the role of CEO, which was not in my future of what I saw for myself, and have been challenged and loved every aspect of that as well. It's different when you're able to take care of your neighbors, your bus drivers, your friends that you grew up with, you have a set of higher peg up of responsibility, I feel, because in turn will be able to see them at the grocery store, run into them at the gas station, and you have to feel great about the care that you provided and they receive. Jon Doggett: And I'm going to thank both of you for all the great work that you have done in this very important field. And this will be the first time I thank you, but I'm sure it won't be the last. Let's get to the topic at hand. We've been navigating the impact of the virus on our day-to-day lives for more than a year. And what a year it's been, what's been the experience and the impact of the virus in rural America, from your perspective? And Carrie, I'm going to start with you first. Carrie Saia: Looking back over the last year we pulled together our incident command teams. We were meeting twice a day just to keep up with the changes and the information that's coming out. We were one of the first counties in Northeast Kansas to have a positive COVID virus case. We were doing testing out in our Morton building just get to picture of that. Something that we storaged equipment and housing in and never in my lifetime would I have thought I'm going to take care of patients there, but it was a safe environment. The patient could stay in their car, that has changed. We have a new rural health clinic with a separate entrance, and we're doing some testing in-house now, which is nice. And our winners in Kansas to not have our staff out, taking specimens in vehicles. But we did not see a surge in our hospital of actually taking care of COVID patients until the November, December timeframe. Carrie Saia: And I think for some, that was our really, really challenging months where my voice cracked in an interview because I just was not certain how our staff were going to take the unknowns. And we have one ventilator in our hospital. We had one negative pressure room that didn't open up until just a couple of months ago. And our staff were just at their breaking points. When you have to take care of a patient for six, eight hours, knowing that if they need intubated, they're going to have to stand beside them and bag them. If the one ventilator we have is in use was very, very hard and challenging. Our staff have rebounded, they're resilient, they're doing much better now. The percent positivity is around 6% in our community currently. We have had higher turnover, we've had some that were close to the end of their careers and have retired early. And that impact has been significant. We've had to pay some agency staff, but right now we do not accept when in our home health environment. I'm going to knock on some wood right now. We're fully staffed in that arena. Jon Doggett: Well, I know just from all of the things that I've and read the stress and pressure on those frontline healthcare workers had to be just amazing. And when you're in a small community like that, you're dealing with somebody that you know, you may have gone to school with that person's kid, or you went to church with that person, or you were in the church choir with that person's spouse. I mean, it becomes real personal then and you have this pandemic that is just overwhelming. That had to be horrible. Carrie Saia: That along and not having the right supplies at the right time and asking people to make gowns for us because we could not get gowns. And we were using reusable gowns, just the creativity and the stress from a lot of different angles was very, very hard for staff. Jon Doggett: So Alan Morgan hearing Carrie's story, you've probably heard that story a time or two from some of your members as well? Alan Morgan: Over and over again, unfortunately. Carrie's facility is not unusual in a sense that it's designed for primary care and general surgery, and they do a great job of that. Looking nationally, just the quality measures of a facility like Carrie's is comparable, and many times better than their urban counterparts. But the fact of the matter is these small-town hospitals were never designed for a global pandemic, and there are so many great aspects of rural America. And obviously like you Jon, I'm a little biased and I'd rather be in a small town than in urban area. But when it comes to a global pandemic, this was the worst possible setup. You've got these hundreds of small towns all across United States. They've got a higher percentage of elderly and a much higher percentage of the population with multiple chronic health issues, not one but multiple. All of these measures made these the worst possible communities for a global pandemic. Alan Morgan: And you add on top of that in a small town. And this happens again and again, you've got the whole population really funneling through five or six businesses, the Dollar General, the Walmart, the church. And so you've got the entire community on a regular basis that are highly susceptible to a pandemic coming through these choke points. In communities that are set up for primary care, if not for dealing with intensive cases of a coronavirus. So right from the beginning, we knew this was going to be a problem. Jon, since July of last year, hospitalizations, COVID cases themselves and mortality have all been much higher in rural America than urban. And in fact, in January and the end of December mortality in rural counties cross US was 48% higher than urban America. In my perspective, this really has been a rural pandemic and it's just such a horrible strain on these small towns all across the US. Jon Doggett: Now, Alan, that's actually something that we wanted to talk about here, because I think part of the problem stems from that a year ago, when this pandemic was first landing on America's shores, it was unfolding in urban areas. And that disconnect, I think, between rural and urban America really fueled this problem where I think folks in rural areas looked at it and said, oh, that's a city problem. We don't need to worry about that here. Have you noticed that? And how does it impact our efforts to beat this virus? Alan Morgan: Absolutely. And let's be honest outside on the small towns when people hear the word rural, we all think about the farmers and ranchers out in Western Kansas. And those guys pioneered the concept of social distancing, right? They've got that down. But what we really need to focus in our tells just like Carrie's small communities of two to three stoplights with these communities that are at high risk. And to your point, we saw this. And when that summer surge happened, it really happened in rural America. It happened in communities with, in some cases, processing plants, it happened in communities that had prison populations. It happened in resort areas. One of the worst things that we saw over the last year was people thinking, I need to go to this ski place, this hiking place, this national monument to get away from this. And they basically seeded the community with coronavirus as a result of that. It was a huge problem on the front end, getting a hold of this. Jon Doggett: Let's talk about the vaccine. We got the first vaccine approved in December and two others have been approved since then. And I got my second shot a week ago. That's provided a lot of hope that we might be coming out at the other side of this thing, but boy, there's some hesitancy out there. So Alan, we're going to start with you. And then I want to talk to Carrie. But your organization, you obviously have spent a little bit of time looking at what these vaccines are, how they got developed, how they got approved. What's your opinion on the vaccines Alan? Alan Morgan: Well, we need to be promoting them in a rural context. And it goes back to the uniqueness of rural America. These are tender boxes when it comes to COVID and the best way to address this number one, basic public health measures, wearing a face mask, social distancing. Number two, the vaccine itself. And it's something that from the beginning we've been front and center of arguing that rural communities should be prioritized in this, just because of what we just talked about, the workforce concern. You lose a couple of docs and a few nurses in Cleveland Clinic or DC General Hospital. It's an issue, but it's not a crisis. Carrie loses a couple of physicians at her facility, it's crisis. And because of that, it needs to be prioritized. That's been the concern. I got to be honest with you, Jon, in looking this, there's been a huge pressure among a lot of the States to get as many shots in the arm as quickly as they can. Alan Morgan: It's a little bit more difficult to get these vaccines out to these small towns. And so it takes extra effort at the state level to make that happen. And that's the key point about this? We always advocate at the national rural health association. You need flexibility to recognize that each rural community is unique. It turns out that in a global pandemic, you really need a federal approach to make sure that these vaccines are distributed in an equitable manner. And that's been a concern for us. It's been a mixed bag today about getting these vaccines out to the rural communities. Jon Doggett: Carrie, what are people saying about the vaccines in your community and how are you addressing some of the misinformation? Carrie Saia: Trying to tackle it with facts and information. I believe our community is still probably similar to other rural communities and other communities in general. They are split within beliefs of the vaccine or not, our own organization disappointingly we're just under 70% vaccinated. I wish that was higher. When you ask about my medical providers morale, the day that they were able to line up and get their first dose of vaccines back in December with the Pfizer dosage, they were giddy. It was just like, I couldn't ask for a better shot of morale booster than them being able to receive the vaccine. And I'm proud to say a 100% as soon as they can get it have been vaccinated and received the vaccine. We've been working really close with our local public health and have done some mass vaccinations. We felt like our community would feel more comfortable going out to the 4-H complex and the heritage complex in their vehicles and distributing vaccines. Carrie Saia: Some said they felt like cattle being run through a shoot. And I'm like, well, it's just getting the vaccine. They get to stay in their car. It was very organized with their 15-minute wait, most waited 20, maybe 25 minutes at most in and out and done. The struggle has been getting the vaccine. And just this week I feel like, gosh, we've got enough vaccine to where we can just open it up. And along with the governor's regulations, we are now able to open it up to anybody 18 and older, and that feels huge. We've been given the Pfizer, the Moderna, and just yesterday, we received our first ship note of the Janssen or the J&J vaccine. So we have a wide plethora for people to choose from and are so excited to now just open it up to anyone. Dusty Weis: Talk about those brand names for a second, Carrie, because you hear about this a lot in the news or from the people that have gotten their shots. We're Pfizer family, we got the Moderna. Is there really any reason for people to get picky about which shot they get? Is any vaccine really better or worse than any other at this point? Carrie Saia: Any vaccine is better than the coronavirus or COVID-19 virus. Any vaccine is better. And any vaccine that you can get and help increase the number of people in our community that are vaccinated, with the new regulations that come out, you can get together in your home now without mask and with vaccinated people start that socially norm again. That part is exciting. And I don't know that everyone understands the importance of that and feeling safe. Jon Doggett: Alan Morgan, the CEO of the National Rural Health Association, you've been pushing for equitable distribution of the vaccine in rural areas. You want to give a grade? Alan Morgan: It's tough because honestly it is all over the board and you've heard the success that Carrie has had today with getting the vaccine out to her community. I've heard stories such as that. I've heard stories where take, for example, Boulevard, Tennessee. We have a rural hospital there that has 85% of its staff vaccinated. And currently, they're undergoing efforts to be able to reach out to the African-American population in their small town to make sure that they actually are vaccinated as well. And so you've got good examples of that, where it's working and you've got the outreach, the hard-hit members of the community. Alan Morgan: But for every story like that, I've got a rural hospital in Pennsylvania that received only one shipment at the beginning of this, for their staff. They haven't seen anything since then. That story has been repeated in Alabama and Texas and in other states as well, too. And as you've mentioned also, it's not just getting the vaccine out. It's being able to get people to sign up, to get transportation to those vaccination places. And then what we said, we've got the hesitancy on top of that. And the data has shown, let's be honest in a rural context, there is a much larger percentage of the population that's hesitant to take the vaccine. Jon Doggett: So Carrie, all of the folks in your hospital got the shot. And I think if that doesn't say something to people, I don't know what would, but in light of that, what about the hesitancy to get the vaccine now? You're seeing it in Holton. What are some of the things you've done to counter some of those concerns and meeting people where they're at? Carrie Saia: Just to correction. A 100% of my medical providers have received the vaccine. I do not have a hundred percent of my staff. We've tried to be patient, tried to show the benefits of the vaccine. Educate, help them understand that it's not just protecting themselves. It's protecting the loved ones that they may be around and how they can spread the virus to others if they don't get the vaccine. And maybe they aren't going to have complications from the exposure to the virus and becoming positive with the virus. I wish I had a crystal ball. I think any medical provider, any person in this universe would love a crystal ball that shows what the impact of COVID-19 is going to be on themselves, around someone else. You can't predict if it's going to hit you tough or someone else tough, you can take the choice of making sure you're doing your role by being as safe as you can, because we know that COVID-19 is a very serious illness. Carrie Saia: We know that it's not the flu. We know that it causes death, death in numbers that we have not seen in years. And we know that we can transmit it and share it to other ones, our loved ones, and cause our loved ones to become sick. We need to take this additional step of getting the vaccine, still leading that healthy lifestyle. Our flu numbers have just plummeted. They just are non-existent this year. Why is that? Because people are washing their hands more. They're wearing a mask more. What are we going to know five years from now about this virus? We're learning stuff every day. And so we're trying to take the approach of educating. We're not forcing, we're not mandating that as part of our employment I would love to, but we're not because we want people to understand and feel comfortable, but know that that is a very key point in making the turn on this virus. Dusty Weis: I've always looked at it from the perspective that if the guy that works on my truck tells me that he got some work done to the brakes because it was going to make his truck safer. I would go out and I would get that same work done to my brakes on my truck. Why is it then do you think that people look at something like their doctor and say, oh, well my doctor got this shot. I don't want that shot. Carrie Saia: I think it's the different sources of information that they're listening to right now. There are so many different sources that people can go to maybe to feed in what they want to hear versus taking the time to listen and listen to a trusted source. Jon Doggett: Alan Morgan, you're running a national organization. You have all of these members out there like Carrie and others across the country. What tools have you been able to provide to your members to help them with this conversation in their local community? Alan Morgan: I think we're seeing a shift right now and your organization is part of this, of recognizing in a rural context, you really need trusted resources within the community to be able to share this message. In a rural context, movie stars and politicians just are never going to hold any sway whatsoever. And so the push needs to be towards having trusted resources within that community. And I want to go a step further to say, Jon, your organization and your members are better positioned to really make this case for two reasons. One, you understand how science plays a role with an agriculture and you understand the relevance and the importance of it. And you need to follow the science, number one. Number two, all my, you certainly understand the concept of federal bureaucracy and burdensome regulations. For the last 20 years in the medical community we've been arguing it's not necessary to spend 10 to 20 years for approval of new drugs and devices. Alan Morgan: That's ridiculous. And we've listened to federal bureaucrats say, no, no, no it's necessary. Well, the problem is now we've got a pandemic and we've been able to show the science that these vaccines are safe. And we've been able to do that in under a year, which is what we've always said. Follow the science, but now federal bureaucrats are saying, oh no, no, it's okay. And there's a trust problem here, but your members are positioned to be able to say, trust the science. And there is a coherent reason of why this vaccine is safe and effective at this time. Dusty Weis: You know, Alan, sometimes I find that the best way to calm somebody's fears or mistrust about the boogeyman is to pull open in the closet door and show them that there's no boogeyman in there. So how about it here? Can we bust some COVID vaccine myths? What's one myth that you've heard about the vaccine and what's the truth to that myth?. Alan Morgan: Wow, I'm sure Carrie actually on the front end is heard of lot of these, and I think I would argue they fall into two categories, the ridiculous, and then the ones that seem to have some basis, but can be busted. And in the ridiculous category, I would say, I don't want to take the vaccine because it's going to give me COVID. Obviously that's not the case, it's never been the case and that's easily busted, but we hear that a lot. And then there's the ones, there have been limited examples, extremely limited examples of blood clotting among the latest iteration of the vaccine. Alan Morgan: The important thing I think you have to keep going back is what you opened with. There literally have been millions of people that have been vaccinated today and on these cases that are so unusual, they make headline news because they are unusual. And I think just that concept of how unusual an adverse outcome would be under such a situation should help alleviate that the odds are tremendously in the favor that you will have no adverse outcome as a result of this. Jon Doggett: You know, there were no headlines in the Washington Post last week that said, Jon Doggett of Woodbridge, Virginia got a second shot and everything turned out hunky-dory. Dusty Weis: Carrie, what about you? What's a myth that you've heard and what's the real truth to it? Carrie Saia: I have had challenges with our younger staff be more hesitant and it's more along the lines of the potential nurse or patient that wants to have a family. And so what we've done is I have a pregnant daughter-in-law and I've asked her OB, why don't you go and talk to your OB doctor and ask them, what do you recommend me getting my vaccine or not? And she actually has, and he recommended getting it just like I recommend you getting the flu shot because you getting the COVID virus as a person while you're pregnant is worse than the potential, any complications of the COVID vaccine. Now there have not been a lot of trials on that, but when you look at the millions, as Alan talked about. The millions that have gone and received it, there are very, very, very few that have had any complications. Dusty Weis: Jon, what about you? What's a myth that you've heard? Jon Doggett: I get a flu shot every year, but I'm not going to get a COVID shot because they only just recently developed it. Well, as I understand it, every flu vaccine is an annual event. I mean, they develop that every year and I get a flu shot every year. So really this isn't that much different, but you would think that we're doing something that's completely out of the ordinary. We're doing what we've always done. This is how we beat measles and tuberculosis and polio. You name it. We've beat back all this stuff by putting a needle in somebody's arm and giving them a vaccine. It's not that complicated, but somehow we've decided we're going to make it complicated. Jon Doggett: We make it political. And when the Lord came along and said, I'm going to take you and you and you, because you had COVID, he didn't say who's a Republican and who's a Democrat, and who lives in rural American, and who lives in an urban city. This all of us together and this is kind of us fighting back something. And we've done that before with other things, we ought to be able to do it with this. But that said, I'm optimistic. I really am. And I'm more optimistic now than I was say, six weeks ago. Of course, I got the vaccine. And that makes a big difference. But looking at this, what makes you optimistic that we're going to meet the goal to defeat the pandemic? And what is the most important thing that you think people ought to do right now today that are listening to this podcast? Carrie going to start with you. Carrie Saia: You touched on a couple of points and at the height of our influx of hospitalized patients and really worried about if we had one more patient come into our ER that was COVID positive and needed a bed. We didn't know where we were going to put them. And we didn't know that we would be able to transfer them out. And I pleaded with an interviewer at the time, this is not a political virus. There's nothing political about wearing a mask. Nobody wants to wear a mask. Nobody likes to wear a mask. We weren't born with masks. We just need to do it. This is another plea. We just need to get the vaccine. I feel hopeful because I've seen the joy in people's eyes, our farmers, my dad was a farmer. I helped him get vaccines on our farm. He would have been first in line to receive the vaccine. Carrie Saia: Farmers work in a unique environment because for the most part, day in and day out, they're by themselves. They're out on their tractors, they're out working with their cattle, but they do go to church. They do go into the co-op. They do go into the grocery store. They do go to weddings. They do go to events that they need to be safe and feel safe of not spreading the virus. That's my plea to please just get vaccinated, take your first opportunity to do it, but we want to give it to anyone. And we want our communities to get back on the road to where we want to be. Jon Doggett: Allen, what makes you optimistic? And what's the thing you think people ought to be doing today? Alan Morgan: Well, I'm optimistic, but I do have concerns. The optimism comes from the fact that over the last three weeks, finally, finally, for the first time, since last July numbers of COVID cases, hospitalizations and mortality in rural counties are all finally lower than urban counties. Now we haven't seen this for months. And so that obviously gives reason for great optimism, but my concern is, and I think you've seen in the news that the cases are beginning an uptick again, the data I got from the CDC this morning is a 15% increase in urban counties over the past week alone. And so we're not out of the woods. Alan Morgan: And why is that happening? Because of these new variants that we're now seeing that are much more transmissible and the leading science indicates that they're more problematic from a hospitalization standpoint. And this is impacting the younger community because a huge percentage of the elderly have been vaccinated. The rural COVID cases are down. That's great. The elderly population has been vaccinated for the most part. That is great. But we're simply not out of the woods. And we've just got to really come together as the nation and particular from a rural perspective, to make sure we get these shots in the arms as quickly as we can to keep our rural towns safe. Jon Doggett: I told one of our state execs yesterday, I'm more worried about the next six weeks than I have been the previous six weeks because everybody says, well, the numbers are down and I got my first shot or everybody else in the family got a shot. I don't need to get a shot. Or I got one, I'll try to remember to get the second one. That's where I get afraid is because we're letting our guard down. Alan Morgan: Absolutely, absolutely. And I want to highlight again, back in December and January, this virus was circulating among the population that was eating inside restaurants without masks, and they were doing all the wrong things. And now it's actually circulating among a lot of us that have been taking good measures to date because it just has become more virulent when we're trying to deal with it. It's actually become much better at bypassing some of our safety measures. So to your point, this is a particularly dangerous time for the next month. Jon Doggett: And the people are tired of wearing masks. Dusty Weis: My wife slapped me on the nose the other week because I went out, I got my first shot and I'm like, hey, why don't we just cheat a little bit? Why don't we go out for dinner? And she's like, you're a runner, dusty. Would you run 23 miles of a marathon? And then stop? No, just finish the darn race. Just get there, get your shot. Otherwise, this whole year has been for nothing and she was right. I took my slap on the nose with grace and dignity. Jon Doggett: Yeah. Well, we can wear masks a little bit longer when Fiona Walker and May Walker ages seven and five put on their mask without their mom telling them to every morning. Yes. They go off to school. And so my daughter said, I don't know what's going to happen with these girls when I can tell them you don't have to wear the mask anymore because it's just automatic. Put the mask on you, get behind your little partition in your desk. You give a little space. What a great thing to have is to teach your children that they don't have to have masks anymore. I'm looking forward to that day. Is there anything else we want to talk about guys? Anything you feel that we've not hit, that you want to, or anything that we need to emphasize more. Carrie Saia: Just know that we have a lot of work to still do and grow and appreciate your organization taking the time to publicize this very, very important information. And I hope that if someone has questions about vaccines, that they'll reach out to their local provider and who they trust to help them talk through what are the risks? What are the benefits? What do they recommend? Alan Morgan: You know, Jon. Carrie raises a good point. I want to go back because this ties into something that she had mentioned earlier in this broadcast. And that is the impact this has had on our rural hospital and on the workforce of it. And this workforce issue is going to be facing us for the decade to come. I mean, it really has crushed the safety net when it comes to staffing at these rural hospitals. And from a community standpoint, these small towns need to recognize how valuable having these points of care are. Alan Morgan: Having 24 seven emergency room service in Holton Kansas allows the seniors to stay in that community. And if we could just view this from a perspective of how do we help our small town thrive and survive and continue to exist and to do that, we have to make sure that we're taking this seriously. We're getting vaccinated for no other reason to make sure that we keep that local health care access point there. And it really is going to be an issue for us as we move forward, making sure that we can keep the doctors, the nurses, the 24/7 emergency room service that is absolutely necessary in these small towns. Jon Doggett: Well, growing up on a ranch, 22 miles outside of a County seat of a thousand people with a hospital with four beds, you never really thought much about the hospital until you had somebody that you were hauling into town that had a heart attack or somebody, we had a guy lose part of his hand. All of a sudden that becomes really important to have that hospital. When my dad was in his final days of fighting cancer, that rural community rallied around him around that hospital. That was the focal point. Had that not been there, he would've spent his final couple of weeks in a hospital, a hundred miles away with people that didn't know him, everybody in that hospital knew who he was because we all grew up together. And that's why it's important to have those rural hospitals. And it's why I wanted to have this conversation with the two of you. Jon Doggett: We didn't go to Georgetown Medical School to get somebody to appear on this. And we didn't go to somebody at Mount Sinai Hospital to be on this podcast. We wanted to get folks that understood and talked to the folks that we're talking to, folks in rural America, farmers and ranchers, and people in rural communities. Because if you think back to that time, when dad had the heart attack and you needed to get him to town and get him to the hospital, the importance of having that hospital there, that importance of having a staff that was well-educated well-trained and well-resourced to go ahead and deal with those things. Jon Doggett: That's the other part of this. And thank you, Alan, for bringing that up because that's part of this pandemic is how are we going to be able to get to the other side of this with all of those resources still available? Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association and Carrie Saia, CEO of Holton Community Hospital. Thanks so much for joining us on the NCGA podcast. And I'm Jon Doggett.

    "title": "CommonGround Webinar Series Offers Insight, Connection",
    "content": "While volunteers from across the country have not been able to meet in person nationally, CommonGround continues to offer opportunities to learn more and hone skills online through a second online training series. This series of three webinars, which launched last week, builds upon the series of learning and networking opportunities offered online over the summer of 2020. The first session welcomed new volunteers to incredible work being done by more than 200 farm women like them across the country. Through state associations' support and hard work, these women serve as resources for consumers who have questions about how their food is grown. Additional sessions are planned for April 21 and May 19, featuring Roxi Beck of the Center for Food Integrity to update the pandemic’s impact on consumer food trends and a social storytelling workshop on May 19. Sharing their personal stories, the volunteers who make up this grassroots movement foster conversations based on shared values that help moms off the farm discover that they can feel good about the food they feed their families. America’s farm families provide an amazing array of options, but honest questions are understandable with so many competing claims. By serving as resources, these women have shared their unique understanding of important topics, such as the difference between organic and conventional crops and how ranchers care for their animals, more than a billion times since 2010. To find out more about how women are sparking these important conversations and to learn about the participants near you, click here. CommonGround is a grassroots movement to foster conversation among women — on farms and in cities — about where our food comes from. The National Corn Growers Association, the United Soybean Board, and its state affiliates developed CommonGround to give farm women the opportunity to engage with consumers through a wide range of activities.

    "title": "USDA Pandemic Assistance for Producers",
    "content": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced on March 24 Pandemic Assistance for Producers (PAP). The new initiative will bring financial assistance to farmers, ranchers and producers who felt the impact of COVID-19 market disruptions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 passed by Congress in December 2020 included additional Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) assistance of $20 per acre for producers of eligible crops, including corn. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) will automatically issue payments to eligible producers based on the eligible acres included on their CFAP 2 applications. These payments should start being distributed this month. The Consolidated Appropriations Act also granted USDA with the authority to provide support for ethanol producers who were impacted by a drop in ethanol demand. USDA is expected to share details of this assistance in a proposed rule likely to be released in the next few months. USDA will be holding a webinar this Thursday, at 2:00 p.m. EDT to cover changes made under PAP for CFAP applicants, CFAP 2 program basics, and resources to assist with sign up. Registration is available online. For additional details on the PAP initiative and CFAP assistance, visit farmers.gov/pandemic-assistance.",

    "title": "The Potential for Corn and the Animal Ag Sector Through Next-Generation DDGS",
    "content": "Opportunities for new corn fractionation technologies at dry mills create value by further separating out the various components of corn to allow differential utilization of the subsequent product streams. Feed rations and specific ingredients for animals can be optimized by separating corn into its most valuable components. Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles (DDGs) are a co-product of the ethanol production process and used 1.075 billion bushels of corn in 2020. DDGs are a valuable feed ingredient for cattle, swine, poultry, and aquaculture as they are rich in the protein, fat, minerals, yeast, and vitamin that animals need. DDGs were never initially engineered, as they were an accidental discovery derived from the ethanol manufacturing process. As these next generation DDGs products become increasingly competitive in their nutritional composition, ethanol manufacturers have the opportunity to diversify their portfolio, plugging into newly created revenue sources. If an ethanol plant is experiencing a lull in liquid fuel demand, they could offset this loss or risk by continuing to produce specialized feed products for livestock, poultry and aquaculture producers as well as the pet food industry. This heightened level of confidence and corn demand consistency at a local ethanol plant could translate to additional dollars back on the farm. Cattle are a very important customer of DDGs, accounting for nearly 80 percent of consumption, with 50 percent attributed to beef cattle and 30 percent attributed to dairy cattle. Approximately 40 million metric tons of DDGs are produced annually. DDGs are nutritionist tested and farmer approved. “We use modified distillers in our grower and finisher diets,” said Clark Price, a corn grower and cattle producer from Washburn, North Dakota. “Depending on the price of the product, we use it as an energy source first, which at 20-to-40 percent in the ration, provides us with all of the protein requirements also. The modified distillers also work as a ration conditioner which binds the ration together and eliminates cattle sorting as well as a rumen conditioner due to its bypass protein.” To learn more about meeting the nutritional needs of the animal ag industry, visit the following one-pagers here: Evolution of DDGS and the Industry Swine Beef Dairy Poultry Aquaculture",

    "title": "Finding Funding for New Uses of Corn A CUTC Special Session",
    "content": "NCGA is pleased to announce a special session of the Corn Utilization and Technology Conference (CUTC) focused on funding for research, development, and commercialization of new uses for corn. This special session will bring together a panel of experts from both the public and private sectors to discuss funding across the RD&C spectrum from bench level to financing new capital at existing facilities. This free online event is scheduled for 10:00-11:30 Central Time on Thursday, May 13, 2021. “One of the key aspects of CUTC is to build a community of researchers and other stakeholders who are focused on new technology. COVID limited our ability to bring this group together, so this session is a good opportunity to have an informational program that is of interest to our entire CUTC audience and keep this community engaged and cohesive,” said Randy DeSutter, Chair of the Sustainable Ag Research Action Team. Funding is an essential component of innovation at every stage, and the panelists are uniquely suited to address a broad range of funding aspects. Drs. Valerie Reed and Tim Conner will describe programs at the Department of Energy and the USDA. Mr. McAfee and Mr. May will provide insights on funding mechanisms in the private sector and how to apply them to fund business growth and other needs successfully. “We are very excited to have panelists of such high caliber and think that our audience will be able to learn a great deal regarding funding innovative projects to extend uses for corn,” said DeSutter. NCGA would like to thank our sponsors, Fluid Quip, Indiana Corn Marketing Council, ITOCHU, Kansas Corn Commission, Minnesota Corn Growers Association and Ohio Corn and Wheat Growers Association whose funding has helped make this effort possible. Additional information, including how to register for the program, can be found at ncga.com/ncyc.",

    "title": "President Biden Outlines Infrastructure Proposal",
    "content": "President Biden today unveiled his American Jobs Plan, a $2 trillion infrastructure proposal investing in a wide range of infrastructure areas. The White House describes the American Jobs Plan as “an investment in America that will create millions of good jobs, rebuild our country’s infrastructure, and position the United States to out-compete China.” The proposal includes: $115 billion to repair roads and bridges $100 billion to expand high-speed broadband across the country $100 billion to upgrade and build new schools Investment in climate and clean energy infrastructure Congress will ultimately decide and vote on, the provisions included in any infrastructure legislation. Discussions on Capitol Hill regarding an infrastructure package are currently taking place and NCGA is sharing corn farmer priorities with members of the House and Senate. The proposal’s $115 billion to modernize 20,000 miles of highways as well as roads and bridges would target the most economically significant large bridges and repair the worst 10,000 smaller bridges. The proposal also includes $17 billion for inland waterways, coastal ports, land ports of entry, and ferries. The $100 billion to expand high-speed internet would enable 100 percent access across the entire country. This proposal will prioritize support for broadband networks owned, operated by, or affiliated with local governments, non-profits, and cooperatives. This will also reduce the cost of broadband internet service and promote more widespread adoption. The Biden proposal also highlights the need to address climate change, reduce emissions, and promote clean air and energy, including investments in the electric vehicle market. NCGA is urging lawmakers account for ethanol’s low-carbon benefits, available today, in any future infrastructure package. The Biden Administration is proposing paying for the infrastructure package with the Made in America Tax Plan. The tax plan would raise more than $2 trillion over 15 years by reforming corporate tax rules, among other provisions.",

    "title": "Biofuels Coalition Welcomes Amicus Briefs in Supreme Court RFS Case",
    "content": "The Renewable Fuels Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, and American Coalition for Ethanol (collectively referred to as the “Biofuels Coalition”) thanked the states of Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, South Dakota, and Virginia for filing an amicus curiae brief in the Supreme Court today in support of the Coalition’s arguments in HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining, LLC, et al., v. Renewable Fuels Association, et al. The Coalition also expressed its appreciation to the other biofuel and agriculture groups that filed amicus briefings in support of the biofuels industry. HollyFrontier and other refiners are asking the Supreme Court to overturn the January 2020 ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) v. EPA, in which the court found EPA exceeded its authority in granting certain small refinery waivers. Recognizing that “the renewable fuel and agriculture industries are the cornerstone of the economies of many states,” today’s brief from the states concludes that “the judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.” “These industries—and the rural economies that they anchor—have grown over the past 16 years in reliance on the promise of the Renewable Fuel Standard,” according to the states’ brief. “And all States have an interest in the environmental benefits and energy independence that the RFS promises to achieve. But the Environmental Protection Agency’s recent trend of freely granting small-refinery exemptions has undermined these promises.” Commenting on the amicus briefings filed today, RFA, NCGA, NFU, and ACE offered the following statement: “The biofuels respondents appreciate the support of the broad array of interests that have been harmed by these unauthorized small refinery exemptions. As the filings make clear, the exemptions have had a devastating effect on rural economies and on the demand for all types of renewable fuels. We remain hopeful that the Supreme Court will affirm the Tenth Circuit’s well-reasoned decision, and we are very grateful that these states and other renewable fuel and agriculture interests have stepped up to endorse the decision as well.”",

    "title": "The Future of Sustainability: Nourish the Future Participant Receives Grant in New Jersey",
    "content": "Sustainable Jersey for Schools recently announced the 34 New Jersey public schools and districts selected to receive Sustainable Jersey grants funded by the New Jersey Education Association (NJEA). Fourteen $10,000 grants and twenty $2,000 grants were distributed to support various projects, including outdoor classrooms, aquaponics food production, water bottle refilling stations, anti-bias training, school wellness programs, waste reduction, student green team capacity building and more. Christine Girtain, a teacher at Toms River High School South and Nourish the Future participant, received one of the $10,000 grants. \"The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is proud to partner with teachers like Christine Girtain through our Nourish the Future program,” said Director of Research and Productivity at NCGA, Robyn Allscheid. “We know that her enthusiasm and passion for research and teaching will help inspire other teachers to think about how they can incorporate real plant science research in their classrooms to help students understand the importance of agriculture.” The project submitted by Girtain for a grant is Investigating Food Crop Sustainability with Corn Genotype to Phenotype Teacher workshop. Partnering with Nourish the Future, the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and the National Corn Growers Association, this project aims to inspire a network of New Jersey area educators to foster critical thinking, connect students to modern STEM agriculture careers, and run a genotype to phenotype turn-key teacher workshop that can help meet Next- Generation Science Standards using a sustainable agriculture theme. Over 20 teachers will receive in-service training and return to run the curriculum with their classes, thus reaching approximately 1,500-2,000 students. “The Education Research and Outreach Lab at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri, is pleased to collaborate with Christine Girtain, an educator from the Toms River High Schools in New Jersey,” said Ph.D., Education Researcher & Program Manager, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center Sandra Arango-Caro. “This collaboration will support professional development for teachers in the region, to implement authentic research experiences in the classrooms that focus on plant and agriculture science to promote STEM interest and careers among students.” Nourish the future is a program made possible by farmerfunded state corn checkoff programs across the U.S. and provides teaching resources that have become even more important as teachers tackle online education. The mission is to teach the ag-based curriculum in the science classroom, inspire students to solve real-world science issues, and inspiring students to fill the job gap in agriculture-related careers, many of which go unfilled.

    "title": "Farmers Share Sustainability Story with Food Industry Leaders",
    "content": "More than 200 high-level innovators in the food and beverage industry explored the challenges and successes they face as they continually strive to become even more sustainable during The Future of Food USA through a panel featuring CommonGround volunteer Kellie Blair, who farms in Iowa, and National Corn Growers Association Corn Board Member Brandon Hunnicutt, who also serves as Chairman of Field to Market in addition to farming in Nebraska. The session, Farmer Perspectives: The Key Sustainability Challenges and Successes from the Ground, shared the farmers’ personal experiences adopting sustainability practices and sparked discussions on how business can support farmers to reach shared goals together. “We focused on the farmer perspective during our discussion of sustainability on our farms, how business can help, and what successes we have seen. On our own farm, and the farms of the other panelists, it seems we have some of the same challenges: weather, labor, defining sustainability and time,” said Blair. “Personally, I love the challenge of telling my farm story to those that may be skeptical about what we are doing. But, as always, I felt that my voice was heard.” This virtual event, held March 23 to 25, brought together leading brands and key stakeholders to identify the main areas of opportunity and innovation within the food and beverage industry. During the annual event, food and beverage industry experts assessed what supply chain transformation actually means on the ground to ensure a more sustainable and resilient food system. “As farmers, we should always be challenging ourselves. Continual improvement doesn’t mean that we are doing a bad job; it just means that we will continue to grow with the best information we have,” Blair said. “Climate, water quality, and soil quality need to be thought of as a systems approach, and no one silver bullet will fix. Agriculture can be a big key to the solution if we all work together!” In addition to Blair and Hunnicutt, the panel, moderated by Innovation Forum Publishing Editor Ian Welsch, included Travis Hopcott, a cranberry farmer who supplies Ocean Spray and U.S. Farmers and Ranchers in Action CEO Erin Fitzgerald. Attendees included representation from companies such as Molson Coors Beverage Company, Walmart, PepsiCo, Kellogg Company, Danone, Yum! Brands, BNP Paribas and Oatly.",

    "title": "EP.17-Short Stature Corn and Other New Ag Tech, with Bayer Crop Sciences Brett Begemann",
    "content": "With planting season upon us, we continue our focus on agronomy for the month of March. In this episode, we catch up with Brett Begemann, the Chief Operating Officer at Bayer Crop Science. He shares details about the new inputs they’ve got in their technology pipeline, what that means for the future of farming and how their role in the ag industry is evolving. We also catch a bit of the March Madness and hear Jon Doggett’s secret for filling out his bracket every year. Before joining Bayer, Brett served as President and Chief Operating Officer at Monsanto Company, where he led global efforts to connect farmers with solutions for growing better harvests. Brett worked for 35 years at Monsanto, holding a number of leadership roles, including Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Direct Share TRANSCRIPTS Brett Begemann: I think things are changing faster now than at any time I've seen them, and mostly for the good. And when things are changing that fast, we have to be careful that we don't become complacent. If we're not doing it different than we did last year, we're probably going backwards, because everybody else is moving forward. Dusty Weis: Hello and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis and I'll be introducing your host, association CEO, Jon Doggett. You can join Jon every month as he travels the country on a mission to advocate for America's corn farmers. From the fields of the corn belt to the DC beltway, we'll make sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: This week is part two of our planting season focus on agronomy. We're talking to Brett Begemann, the chief operating officer at Bayer Crop Science. And we'll hear about some of the new inputs that they've got in their technology pipeline, what that means for the future of farming and how their role in ag is evolving. We'll also catch a bit of the March Madness and hear Jon Doggett's secret sauce for filling out his bracket every year. But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app, that way you can take us with you in your truck, your tractor on your next trip, and never miss an update from Jon. Also make sure to follow the NCGA on Twitter, @nationalcorn, and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com Dusty Weis: And with that, it's time to once again, introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. And Jon with planting season upon us, we're continuing our focus on agronomy for the month of March, bringing your members some insider insights from the leaders of two of the biggest inputs producers in the world of agriculture. Jon Doggett: Dusty. It's been a great opportunity just to chat with one of these executives, but we're now going to get to pick the brains of another one of those executives in just two week period. So that's pretty cool. We think there's a lot that our growers can take from these conversations and apply them to their own success in the fields this year. So today I'm just tickled to death, we're going to be chatting with Brett Begemann. He is the chief operating officer at Bayer Crop Science. Before joining Bayer, Brett served as the president and chief operating officer at the Monsanto company where he led global efforts to connect farmers with solutions for growing better harvests. Brett worked for 35 years at Monsanto holding a number of leadership roles, including executive vice-president and chief commercial officer. So Brett, thanks so much for joining us on the NCGA podcast. Brett Begemann: Jon, I'm excited to be here. Thanks for the opportunity. Jon Doggett: So before we dig in too deep, I understand you're a sports fan and you might be slightly biased, but March Madness is upon us. Brett, who are your picks for the final four? And who do you think will be cutting down the net once it's all said and done? Brett Begemann: Well, Jon, I have to admit I am highly biased. So the fact that the Missouri Tigers are in, my heart says I got to pick my Tigers, but I think they're going to struggle to get for sure through the second round. If they can make it past Oklahoma, they got to take on Gonzaga, which being the number one seed is going to be a tough go if they can get past Oklahoma. So I don't think my Tigers are going to be in the final four, but I'd be optimistic. I have not done my bracket yet. I've been waiting to hear what all the other experts are saying. Brett Begemann: I will tell you, I think the big 10's pretty tough this year. They played a lot of good basketball with the likes of Ohio State and Illinois and Iowa. Not to mention Wisconsin, Minnesota, just a pretty tough crowd up across the big 10. So I suspect you're going to see a couple of them there. But there's also some other good teams out there. And that's why we call it the big dance, because you never know. And there could easily be a Cinderella this year. I think there'll be more surprises in the game this year than we've seen, because we just haven't got to see as many teams play outside their conference. So it'll be exciting like it is every year. And I really look forward to it. Dusty Weis: As a longtime Wisconsin fan and Wisconsin resident, I have to say it makes my heart smile to hear somebody refer to the big 10 with that sort of reverence. But I've got to say, I'm just happy to see an NCAA tournament that doesn't prominently feature Kentucky or Duke. Don't mind seeing them miss the dance every once in a while. But of course, I'm holding out hope for the NCAA college hockey tournament, which is where I actually rest most of my hopes and dreams here. And I'm pulling for a Wisconsin, Minnesota rematch in the final game of that. Jon Doggett: Well, Brett mentioned it, you got to go with your brain instead of your heart. But sometimes that's really, really difficult and I always love watching one of my son-in-laws and my daughter fill out their brackets. Frank does it all with heart and Katie does it as a math major and teaches math and she does it with her brain and guess who does better every year. So I wait until Katie's done with her bracket and then I ask her if she'll share it with dad. So we'll see how that works. I've not talked to her yet about it today, so we're working on it. So, Brett, I understand you were raised on a farm and if I'm correct, you're still involved with that farm. And tell me how that experience helps you every day in your job. Brett Begemann: Yeah, Jon that's right. I grew up on a farm in Western, Missouri, 50 miles or so outside of Kansas City. And I own that farm today. My parents have passed away and my brother lives there and my sister lives just down the road. I have several other farms in the same area, most of those in the same county and then a couple more over here on the eastern side of the state, kind of northeast, Missouri. And I enjoy being connected to agriculture and production agriculture because it's where I spent my nearly 40-year career. And I think it keeps you real. I have to write my checks because I share a crop at all for fertilizer, for seed, for crop protection. Brett Begemann: I talked to the farmers about the digital tools we're using. All the same stuff that we're trying to develop to help farmers, and there's real value in being connected to it every day. Of course, they do all the work. They make most of the decisions but I always enjoy the conversation with them and it helps me understand how they're thinking about making their decisions. And I suspect that's a decent representation for many of the other corn farmers across the country and around the world as they go about making their decisions. Jon Doggett: Yeah. And writing your own checks for those inputs is important, but you've left out an important component of being a farmer and that is, you can't complain about seed cost, can you. Brett Begemann: Well, at heart, I'm a farmer. I happen to work in industry, but I'm a farmer at heart. I think that gives you permission to complain about the weather anytime you want to, you can always complain about inputs. The interesting thing about agriculture, especially for farmers is you're your own purchasing agent. You're the own director of manufacturing and production. You're your own marketer in many cases. So you have to wear a lot of different hats. And I think that gives you a permission in a unique way to be critical of the things that you have to buy as well as the things that you're selling. And I often learn as much from growers when they're sharing with me their concerns, as I learn when they're sharing with me their optimism, because it resonates because I faced many of the same things they do. Jon Doggett: Well, it certainly keeps you grounded, I know that for sure. So Brett, corn farmers are always curious about what's next from companies like Bayer. You folks did some announcements around your R and D pipeline last week, you're spending two and a half-billion dollars a year on innovation. What can corn farmers expect to see out of Bayer in the months ahead and how's that going to impact their operations? Brett Begemann: Jon I'm super excited. I mean, a couple things, first of all, let me back up a little bit. I spent time with your farmers, with the corn growers and other industry associations a number of years ago when we first started talking about Bayer and Monsanto coming together. And one of the things I said is that the intent of these two organizations coming together was to invest in innovation in agriculture like nobody else. And that we weren't doing it to cut our spending in R and D, we were doing it to make our R and D even more effective. And we've done that. And as we announced, we spend close to two and a half-billion dollars a year on R and D and out of that for corn farmers, already next year is a couple of really cool things, the next generation of smart stacks. Brett Begemann: So smart stacks pro coming with a new control for corn rootworm that's RNAI based, which has really different mode of action than anything else for rootworm control in the market today. And I couldn't be more excited about that. But I have to tell you the one that excites me even more, and I think it's going to change corn production for a long time is short stature corn. And I had some pictures that we carried around that we used at our capital market day of those fields growing in Iowa with the horrible windstorm that went through there this year. And the only corn standing in our research trial was the short stature corn. And what's really cool is that corn yields as good as conventional corn. And we're introducing that next year too. We already have a breeding version of that in Mexico, but we'll introduce that in North America this coming year. We also have other versions of that that will continue to develop and bring forward. Brett Begemann: But I'm really excited about it. It changes the way we can grow corn. From how we can access the crop with ground clearance equipment, how we can manage our fertility and disease control and insect control, weed control throughout year in a different way. I just think it's going to open the door to a lot of additional innovation in corn. So I'm really excited about what we're bringing for corn. And there's a host of other things. Of course, many of your producers are also growing soybeans, if they're growing corn. We've got a lot of new things coming in soybeans. We got crop protection products that are coming and a lot of new digital tools that are coming as well. So it's an exciting time right now, a lot of new stuff coming. Dusty Weis: Brett, for growers who want to learn more, especially about the short stature corn varieties, where can they go to learn that? And if they're interested in potentially getting involved, do you guys have a waitlist going, or how do they go about getting signed up? Brett Begemann: We don't have a waitlist going just yet. There'll be some out there again this year. And you'll see us promoting that a lot more this year as we have trials out for farmers to take a look at, actually go see it and experience it themselves because I think that's ultimately the best test. There's some information on our website at bayercropscience.com. You can go there and look at it, but the most information will start coming this year. As we put it out in the field commercially, we'll have farmers growing it, not research trials, there'll be real commercial crops. So we'll get a chance to take a real look at it. And we'll share that with farmers very openly. And that will be coming here soon in the spring time. You'll see us start to promote that. Dusty Weis: I'd really like to hear a little bit more about your R and D operation. As someone who's never been, I picture a lot of white lab coats, glass flasks. What's it like for you to walk through this operation and talk to the brains behind making these incredible advances in technology? Brett Begemann: Having been at Monsanto a long time and now Bayer, the largest, and I think one of the most successful plant science research facilities in the world sits here in Chesterfield, in St. Louis, Missouri. I make it a point to go on the tour, which we do for thousands of people every year, on a fairly regular basis, at least every year, if not more than once a year. And the reason I do is because it's always changing. Science is advancing at an accelerating rate. There was a time when, and I'm no scientist, I'm just a business guy, but when chemistry and biology started crashing together and started changing things. And now you see data starting to crash together with chemistry and biology in a very unique way. And the innovation that's coming out of research today is a combination of all of those things at one time. Brett Begemann: So we now do our first research and our first yield trials with our new lines on a chip. We don't do them in a field. We do them on a computer chip and then the winners and losers out of that chip are the ones that get determined to go to the field or not. So it's just how it's all come together. So yes, you see people in lab coats, you also see people in boots and jeans and t-shirts working in a greenhouse and more often than not, they're in their boots and jeans, unless they have that lab coat on because they're doing something in a lab that requires that. And of course, safety is always a first priority for anybody in a lab. And then you'll see all kinds of sophisticated sequencing machines, the most sophisticated that you would see in any medical lab around the world or any other plant science lab in the world are in that facility, as well as the computer capability and data analytics that are utilized today. Brett Begemann: Very proud of it, of course, I'm biased, but it's quite a sight. And for anyone that's been through it, I always say, never pass an opportunity... And not just ours. I mean, there's other great companies out there too. Don't pass the opportunity to go back through, because I promise you, it's going to be very different. Agriculture is changing fast and every other industry is as well. It's a unique opportunity to take advantage of it, Dusty Weis: Jon, from your perspective, decades in the industry, when you hear about advances like that, do you ever take a moment just to appreciate how unbelievably cool it is that we're going in and editing the genes of corn crops? Jon Doggett: Yeah, it's amazing. And Chris Edgington, our first vice president says, and I repeat it often, \"If you haven't been on a corn farm in five years, you haven't been on a corn farm.\" And I think the same is true with the seed industry. I've been in the Washington area since 1988 and I've spent an inordinate amount of time defending agriculture from a stereotype that existed back in the 40s, 50s, and 60s. And often what I do is I hold up my cell phone and say, \"What did your cell phone look like 25 years ago?\" Jon Doggett: Why do people think that that technology is moving faster than the technology on the farm or in these companies? And it's the gee golly whiz stuff. And it's pretty cool. For me, it's hard to understand sometimes, but I'm really, really impressed with it. So Brett, last year we got together at Commodity Classic and we talked about a minor issue, Roundup and you know well that we absolutely believe glyphosate is an essential tool for farmers to have. I'm going to ask you for the purpose of the podcast so our farmers can hear from you. Are farmers going to be able to rely on it in the future? Brett Begemann: Well, Jon, I absolutely think farmers are going to be able to rely on glyphosate and, in our case Roundup now and well into the future. To your point, it's one of those classic molecules and I have been very fortunate in my career to be associated with it for a long time, but it made a huge difference in agriculture. And while it's 30, 40 years old, it's still making a huge difference. It enabled so many cool things and I'm so impressed with what farmers have been able to do by utilizing it, call it the breakthrough chemistry of that. And I was around when we launched Roundup. And I remember people saying, \"What would you ever do with a herbicide that kills everything?\" And you just sit back and watch farmers. They're some of the most innovative people in the world and look what they've done. Brett Begemann: They went from a lot of tillage to a little tillage. They've changed the way they manage the soil. We're managing our soil with wind erosion, water erosion, et cetera, in different ways. Now we're talking about carbon and how do you leverage crop protection tools and seed tools to be able to do the kinds of things that we do. So it's still, even though it's old, is a really important component and we're doing everything we can as I committed last year at the Commodity Classic, to maintain the use of that molecule. We don't sell it all in the world. In fact, we sell less than half of it in the world, but we're spending all the money to defend it and keep it available to farmers. And we are absolutely convinced that we're going to be able to do that. Brett Begemann: At the same time, I have to say, it's really cool. We discovered a new mode of action last year in herbicides, first one in 30 years, which is kind of hard to believe that it's been that long since a new mode of action. And it's already in phase three. So it's only a few years away and it looks pretty impressive. And it also looks really impressive on some of the grass species that can be difficult for glyphosate. So just because we have Roundup and glyphosate, doesn't mean we don't invest in R and D to bring new tools. Getting more and more options in the toolbox for farmers is what it's all about. They need choices. And we always hope to have the one that they're going to pick, but they need choices and we're going to defend glyphosate, but we're also going to invest in new ones. Jon Doggett: You folks have done a wonderful, wonderful job in defending this chemical and you've shouldered that pretty much by yourselves. And we all owe you a debt of gratitude for that. One of the things Brett, I think is so important, and I've been talking to my friends in the environmental community. It resonates a bit when the environmental community comes to agriculture and says, \"We want you to do great things to sequester carbon in the soils.\" I was [inaudible 00:16:56], \"Hey, we can do that, but take all our technology away from us, we'll be farming like we were in the 40s and that is not where any of us want to go back to.\" So it's important. Jon Doggett: And we need to continue to let our friends in the environmental community know that we can do a lot but we have to have those tools, the ones that are existing and the ones that you're talking about bringing to the marketplace. And I'm hopeful because I'm an optimist. I'm hopeful that maybe we can get a few of our friends from the environmental community to start doing a better job in convincing some of their fellow folks that these things are important. Brett Begemann: Yeah, Jon, I think it's really important that we're at the table for these conversations. Agriculture as an industry is at those tables, because these topics are going to be discussed with or without us. And what's the old saying, \"If you're at the table, you're in the discussion. If you're not at the table, you're on the menu.\" And I think sometimes that can happen to us in agriculture and I'm proud of our industry and I have no problem standing on a stage or sitting at a table and claiming, because I believe it to be true, that this industry of agriculture has done as much or more than any other industry to improve our carbon footprint over the past 50 years. You think about just how we farmed when I started nearly 40 years ago and you look at how we farm today and the huge improvements that we've made in the reduction of tillage and heavy tillage, the improvements in yields that farmers have delivered. Brett Begemann: And that isn't a linear curve in how much nutrient they have put on or water that they've utilizing, but we've increased the productivity dramatically. And in many cases using less stuff. And I think there's opportunity to use even less stuff. When you start looking at digital tools, I'm excited about the day when we can have a piece of equipment that can go through the field and look for the weeds and only spray the weeds and not spray the ground where there are no weeds. Of course, I sell less stuff, but that's great for the farmers, great for society, is great for the planet. That's good stuff. Then we'll figure out how to survive in that we'll innovate, we'll bring new stuff. Brett Begemann: But this industry is making huge, huge improvements. And we need to tell people that because they don't understand that. And I don't get too critical of them. I don't understand many of their industries either, but I count on them to share with me about it and we need to do our part. And that's why I think we need to be at the table because I think we can turn some heads. And I have to tell you COVID is one of those things is turning some heads. Science is relevant again in a very different way than it was a year ago. Jon Doggett: Talking about COVID. How did your business change and adapt because of the pandemic and what are some of the things you learned over the last year that you think are really important and things that we need to remember as time goes by? Brett Begemann: Yeah, who would've thought Jon, when we were at Commodity Classic last year, that we'd find ourselves a month later doing business the way we had to do business and farmers farming the way they had to farm. It's another one of those areas where you look back on the year and you say, \"What an incredible industry.\" The resiliency of this industry just never ceases to amaze me of how both industry and farmers worked together and never missed a beat. And they did an incredible job. We had to make a lot of changes. We ran our systems differently. We relied a lot on virtual tools. We got people out of offices. We only had the people there that had to be there. So we minimized exposure so that we could keep our plants running and keep our seed plants running, keep our logistics and distribution running to get the products to the farmers. Brett Begemann: Retail did their part in making sure that that all happened. It's amazing how the industry collaborated and we had no time to prepare. I mean, it landed on us at planning time and the industry just came together and it was incredible. We learned a lot. I have to tell you, I'll never travel as much as I used to because I learned that I can be even more productive doing part of my work without traveling. Virtual tools are better too. Just the tools that we have today, versus what we had last year in April are far superior today. Technological advances in nine months is phenomenal. I miss traveling. I miss being in the same room with people. I miss meetings like Commodity Classic, where I can interact with people one-on-one and in conference rooms, et cetera. Those will come back. There'll be a role for those. Brett Begemann: But a lot of what we did virtually will stay around too. If I've heard it once, I've heard it a hundred times from our customers of, \"You know some of those virtual things that you guys did? I really enjoyed that. The idea, I didn't have to drive an hour and a half to do an hour and a half plot tour and then drive an hour and a half home. I liked that. You guys should keep doing that.\" We had people that never came to those kinds of events viewing them online and sending us feedback of, \"This is helpful.\" We had people using virtual tools to scout their crops and use FaceTime or equivalent on another phone and turn around and talk to their agronomist or their salesperson. And instead of waiting for somebody to come a half a day later, to look at it, you look at it in real-time and you make a decision and you treat your crop and take care of it. Brett Begemann: Those are all experiences that we're all learning from that we can't let those get away from us. And I think we'll continue to learn because it's brought technology into how we operate in a different way than maybe we thought. We jumped forward by a couple of years, maybe even three or four. And the comfort level, it's amazing. Who would've thought, right? That we could do so many things digitally, but we are and doing it very effectively. And we're all learning from each other and I think it'll keep improving. At the same time, I want to get back and see some people and walk on the farm and walk in the fields and do it, not like we did before, but still have that one-on-one because you can't solve it all virtually. Jon Doggett: Well, I was on, I think 95 or 96 separate airplanes in 2019. I don't want to go back to that. Definitely want to get on an airplane and do some things, but that kind of travel anymore. I think we've realized we don't have to do that all the time. And more importantly, we can bring new people into these meetings and give them an opportunity to see the things that they wouldn't otherwise because they can't leave the farm for half a day or a day or three days. So it's really pretty cool. And if I could just figure out a way to remind myself before I speak to take myself off mute in Zoom, I think the world would be a whole lot better. Brett Begemann: I'm confident Jon, that one of these days, somebody is going to automate that for us so that we can all be a little bit better at that because we've all had that problem more than once. Dusty Weis: Yeah. I tell you, I made some of the greatest points that nobody ever heard in the last year. Brett Begemann: It never comes out the second time as good as it did the first time, does it Dusty? Dusty Weis: Nope. Jon Doggett: Brilliance has a short shelf life, I guess so. Well, we've been talking about how the ag industry is evolving and I constantly wrestle with keeping our organization relevant as all of this change happens. And we know that agriculture is on a path to do great things and change a lot more, but we're all going to have to change with it. And so Brett, what are you doing at Bayer to be relevant? And what advice do you have for us as an organization representing corn farmers? What is some of the things you think we ought to be doing to be relevant today? And more importantly, to be relevant 20, 30 years from now? Brett Begemann: I don't know that I'm the expert. I can give you an opinion, but there's other valued opinions out there too on that, Jon. I have to tell you, I think things are changing faster now than at any time I've seen them and mostly for the good, and when things are changing that fast, we have to be careful that we don't become complacent. One of the things I share with our organization all the time is if we're not doing it different than we did last year, we're probably going backward because everybody else is moving forward. So just because we did something last year that worked really, really well, doesn't mean it's the right way to do it this year. We need to always be looking around and seeing what's changing around us and what's changing with our markets. What's changing with our opportunities. What's changing with our customers. In that, then making the decision what we need to do going forward. Brett Begemann: I think data and analytics is going to change agriculture more than probably any innovation that I've seen in my career. And I've had the fortunate luxury of living through biotechnology and arguably the acceleration of crop protection products. And I think data and digital change it more. And we have to be prepared to keep, not only keep up but lead it. And when I say lead it, as an industry leader, we have a responsibility, but also as an industry, we have a responsibility because we do use 70% of the freshwater in the world and we do use the land. And I think as an industry and an association, I think thinking about and sharing with society, how we continue to improve and the significant progress that we've made, but that we don't have it all figured out. And we're going to keep improving. Brett Begemann: The carbon models that us and other companies are talking about, I'm really excited about ours and how we can make a difference and possibly create a new value stream for farmers to farm in a different way. I think that's all cool stuff, but we got to be looking to the future and we have to be thinking about change. And as we think about that change, that's going to drive us. And I think for the association, it's a little bit the same thing. What's changing around you and what's the needs of the producers and where do we engage to represent them? What's changing in the policy world and how we manage that in the policy world? So I think there's a significant opportunity to continue to engage with all the things that we talk about as industry, but also as industry associations. And I think that's where associations can really do world-class work in representing the farmers voice. Jon Doggett: Well Brett, Bayer's acquisition of Monsanto, that's changed things a lot. And I'm curious to know how having a parent company with European roots has impacted your culture, your business and any other areas you want to mention. Brett Begemann: Yeah, it's interesting because it's one of those things that none of us knew going into it, how it would play out. And I have to tell you, one of the huge benefits in all of this is both of us were multi-national companies. And both of us were used to working in various global areas and part of the advantage that comes along with that is you have an appreciation for the different cultures around the world. I think it's oftentimes said and it's a little bit harder to practice. There's many right ways to do things and when we see somebody doing something different, oftentimes our first inclination is, well, they're doing it wrong. And the reality is, they're not doing it wrong, they're just doing it different, and it works just fine. One of the really cool things, though, when we brought these two companies together is we both had a focus on the customer. Brett Begemann: It was all about business continuity. It's all about taking care of the customer through the early days. And we've been successful in doing that. Of course, when you bring two big companies together, two of the biggest in the industry, there's going to be bumps in the road and we've had our fair share. Some of those with systems, et cetera. I'm sure there's producers within the NCGA that have been frustrated with us for things that we didn't get done and I apologize for that. When you run into those things, that's not how we intend to do business. Part of those are the vagaries of bringing companies together. We will get through that because we know the only way to earn the business is to be the easiest and best company to do business with. So we'll get through that. Brett Begemann: Culturally, we're building a new culture. So it really isn't a European culture or American culture or a Bayer culture or a Monsanto culture. When you bring these businesses together, it's really re-imagining agriculture in a way that is different for all of us, because you bring a premier seed business with a premier crop protection business with a digital platform, it changes who you are as a business and how you approach the business. And we already talked about all the enormous change going on in the industry. If we try to be like either one of us, we're going to not be successful. We have to be somebody new that matches up more with where our customer base is going and where they want to be. All the discussions around approaches to market and the omni-channels and how farmers want to get information, and they're not right or wrong either. Brett Begemann: You have to be there for each of them the way they want you to be there. And that's who we want to be as a company. And we get incredible support to be able to do that, whether we're here in the US or any other part of the world. So I don't see it as a downside, having a European headquarters. We still have close to 5,000 people working here in St. Louis in the middle of the Heartland and half of our executive teams sits here in St. Louis with me so we're well connected in the US business and fortunate for us, our customer base continues to reach out to us and share with us and give us insights. And we're working through the integration of course, but our focus is on innovation and where do we take the company for the future to increase the productivity of agriculture? We got to win for the farmer, we got a win for us as a company, and we've got to win for society. And I don't think there's a company better position to do that than we we are right now. Jon Doggett: You mentioned hearing from your farmers, and you also mentioned the global reach that your company has. What are you hearing from farmers around the world? Not just US farmers, but around the world. What are the challenges they're facing that may be similar, but more importantly, what challenges are they facing that are different than what US farmers are facing? Brett Begemann: One of the things that's the same and you mentioned it earlier, Jon and I'll just echo it. Farmers around the world need tools. And they feel this sentiment that there's as much pressure to lose tools as there is to get new innovation and new tools. And they all say, regardless of scale, and regardless of where they are geographically, that they need new tools and they need more in the toolbox. So we're all aligned on that around the world. And I think there's probably opportunity to work more globally as an industry sometimes to help communicate those points to those that may see it a bit differently than that. Some of the differences is it depends on where you're at geographically. If you think about carbon and carbon sequestration, that's a opportunity I think that fits for commercial agriculture in the Americas. Going to be more difficult in small holder world when you're talking about Asia and Africa, just because of the land holding size, et cetera, and how you would track it and develop it. Brett Begemann: So those are some of the differences, but there's also a tremendous opportunity to help and influence those. I think that one of the things we look at on the digital front is what do we learn digitally? And I think that one of the things we will learn is that while there are things that are very different, I make up my own number because I don't have any statistics behind me. But most of the time when I talk to people, 70, 80% of what we talk about is the same stuff. How much can we learn from other geographic areas of the world? And how can we get out of the cycle of we only get one shot on goal a year? There's a book written about agriculture, 40 tries or something like that. And so how do we double that? Brett Begemann: How do we learn in South America, the Southern hemisphere, and turn around and apply that in the Northern hemisphere and how you learn in the Northern hemisphere and apply in the Southern hemisphere. It's to benefit everyone and it's to benefit our industry. And I think data and analytics is going to give us the opportunity to do that because sometimes within the data, what we learn is some of the things we thought were so important, aren't near as important in influencing the outcome. And some of the things that maybe we were overlooking become more relevant. We'll learn from those kinds of things. And those are differences that turn into strikes for us as an industry and as producers. Jon Doggett: Brett, last question. Bayer is a key partner of ours and I sincerely thank you for all of your support. You're on our ag industry council, you support our corn yield contest with your decal brand. You're a partner with us on Commodity Classic and you certainly came through for us this year with a substantial investment to help us do what we needed to do with a virtual Commodity Classic. And we thank you for that. So why? Why do you do all that? Why is it important for Bayer to support commodity organizations like NCGA? Brett Begemann: There's a lot of short lines out there that everybody has their own. If you want to get something done fast, do it yourself, but if you want to go far, do it together. And I said it probably thousands of times, because I've been in this industry for so long and some people hear me repeat it and get tired of hearing it. But I view it as we're connected at the hip with farmers, because we do something for them that they probably can't do on their own in investing two and a half billion dollars in R and D and developing new innovation. But they do what we don't do very well. They produce it, they take those inputs from us and others and turn it into incredible crops that they grow. And the way we get it done is we do it together and we do it in collaboration and partnership. And industry associations are a way of continuing that collaboration and partnership and working together. Brett Begemann: And that doesn't mean that sometimes we won't sit in a conference room and have a difference of opinion. But for goodness sakes, I have difference of opinion with my wife. I have difference of opinion with my kids. So what? That's what makes us all richer and better. That's how we grow. That's how we change our thinking. That's how we move to better places is bringing those different perspectives together. I'm a huge fan of diversity and inclusion in agriculture because it makes us all better. Get as many perspectives around the table as you possibly can. Does it make it hard to get to a conclusion? Well, of course it does, but I promise you it's a better outcome. Well you get to a better place because you have the power of everybody's mind working with you to think about it. Brett Begemann: And that's how I see it with the corn growers and the other commodity associations, let's work together on this stuff. And we can have our differences of opinion, but at the end of the day, the vast majority of what helps either of us is going to help both of us. I say it all the time. We'll never be more successful as Bayer Crop Science than our farmer customers. It just doesn't work. In this model, it doesn't work. If farmers are not successful, how are we going to be? Because every dollar of cashflow or Euro that we spend in this company comes from a customer somewhere in the world. Sure, the capital market capitalizes us as a company, but our cashflow comes from selling products and services. So we're in this thing together and we want farmers to be as successful as they can be. And it takes give and take. And the way you figure out give and take, is you sit down together and you talk about things. Jon Doggett: Brett Begemann, the chief operating officer at Bayer Crop Science and a farmer.

    "title": "Biofuels Coalition Files Brief in Supreme Court Case",
    "content": "Today, the Renewable Fuels Association, the American Coalition for Ethanol, the National Corn Growers Association and the National Farmers Union, working together as the Biofuels Coalition, filed their response brief in the Supreme Court case HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining, LLC, et al., v. Renewable Fuels Association, et al. In the brief, the coalition argues in support of the challenged Tenth Circuit decision, which held that only small refineries that have remained continuously exempt from obligations under the Renewable Fuel Standard program are eligible for future extensions of the compliance exemption. “We believe the Tenth Circuit got it right the first time, and we will continue to defend the court’s ruling and stand up for the farmers and renewable fuel producers harmed by the granting of these illegal waivers,” the coalition said. “We strongly believe the Tenth Circuit Court’s ruling is consistent with both the Clean Air Act and Congressional intent.” The coalition underscored that the statute only authorizes extensions of the initial temporary exemption that Congress granted to all small refineries at the start of the RFS program. The brief also maintains that the structure and purpose of the temporary exemption were meant to serve as a “bridge to compliance” for all refineries, rather than a permanent regulatory relief program, as the refineries argued in their opening brief. EPA will also file a brief today in support of the Tenth Circuit’s decision. The agency announced last month that it had reviewed the Tenth Circuit’s decision and it now supports the court’s interpretation. The refineries have until April 16 to file a brief replying to the arguments raised by the Biofuels Coalition’s and EPA’s briefs. Oral arguments will be held on April 27.",

    "title": "Next Gen Fertilizer Challenge Recipients Identified for Phase Two Trials",
    "content": "The Fertilizer Institute (TFI), along with the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), The Nature Conservancy, and the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), announced the organizations and products selected for Phase two trials in the Next Gen Fertilizer Challenges. Collectively, the challenges aim to accelerate the development of innovative fertilizer product technologies and to increase the use of existing enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFS) that maintain or increase crop yields and reduce environmental impacts to air, land, and water. The organizations partnered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on the challenges. “For generations, we’ve seen how innovation has shaped modern U.S. agriculture into the most successful and efficient production system in the world,” said Corey Rosenbusch, TFI president and CEO. “This public-private partnership represents the next generation of fertilizer technologies that will produce results for farmers and the land. I am proud to see several TFI members selected here as industry leaders in adopting and promoting these new technologies.” “Corn farmers have a vested interest in using new technology that improves their operations and minimizes their environmental impact,” said NCGA President John Linder. “We are pleased to be a part of these Challenges and to work with these partners to promote sustainable farming practices that build up soil health, allowing farmers to improve productivity and profitability while also preserving natural resources for future generations.” The first of two Next Gen Fertilizer Challenges, EEFs: Agronomic and Environmental Challenge, aims to identify existing EEFs currently on or near-market that meet or exceed certain environmental and agro-economic criteria. Phase one included review and selection of product nominations by an expert judging panel. Phase two, to be initiated this spring, will include greenhouse trial evaluations of the winning products by researchers at IFDC. The products will be evaluated based on environmental, agronomic, and economic performance factors. \"I am pleased to see the Next Gen Fertilizer Challenge bridging the gap between good ideas and their implementation,\" said Albin Hubscher, IFDC president and CEO. \"Strategic partnerships such as this will continue to catalyze innovation in improving global soil health and closing the yield gap. IFDC anticipates exciting results from our evaluations of these products.\" Fertilizers facilitate the growth of crops at yields that provide sustained global food production. However, nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers applied without consideration of the principles of 4R Nutrient Stewardship (source, rate, time, and place) can have harmful economic, environmental, and social effects. EEFs and other new product technologies and formulations control fertilizer release or alter reactions to increase nutrient uptake by the plant and reduce nutrient losses to the environment. These technologies can be an important addition to a conservation practice system that helps reduce row crop agriculture impacts on the environment, while maintaining or increasing agricultural productivity and profitability. “The Nature Conservancy is excited to be part of the Next Gen Fertilizer Challenges as a way to drive new innovations that will help farmers better understand which enhanced efficiency fertilizers may work best on their farm,” said Carrie Vollmer-Sanders, director of strategic engagement for agriculture, The Nature Conservancy in North America. “We are strong advocates of the 4R approach to nutrient management and believe that the EPA and USDA’s science-based approach to the challenge will help farmers implement the 4Rs on their cropland.” The winners include (listed by company and product name): • AgroLiquid: Pro-Germinator • CHS Agronomy: Trivar • Corteva Agriscience: Optinyte • EuroChem Agro: DMPSA • Harrell’s: POLYON • Koch Company Services: CENTURO • Koch Company Services: SUPERU • MicroSource: Hi-Test • Nutrien: ESN • Pursell Agri-Tech: PurYield • Renuvix: Renuvix CRFs • SABIC: BCRU • The Andersons: Struvite DG • Timac Agro USA: Duo Maxx • Timac Agro USA: Top-Phos • Verdesian Life Sciences: AVAIL The second component of the Next Gen Fertilizer Innovation Challenge will identify novel pre-market technologies for fertilizers that can reduce the environmental effects from modern agriculture while maintaining or increasing crop yields. Winners are expected to be announced in spring 2021. The Fertilizer Institute (TFI)is the leading voice of the nation’s fertilizer industry. Tracing its roots back to 1883, TFI’s membership includes fertilizer producers, wholesalers, retailers and trading firms. TFI’s full-time staff, based in Washington, D.C., serves its members through legislative, educational, technical, economic information and public communication programs. Find more information about TFI online atTFI.org. Learn more about TFI’s nutrient stewardship initiatives atnutrientstewardship.org. Founded in 1957, the National Corn Growers Association represents nearly 40,000 dues-paying corn farmers nationwide and the interests of more than 300,000 growers who contribute through corn checkoff programs in their states. NCGA and its 50 affiliated state organizations work together to create and increase opportunities for corn growers. An independent non-profit organization, IFDC is active in 20 countries in Africa, Asia, and America. Combining science-backed innovations, an enabling policy environment, holistic market systems development, and strategic partnerships, the organization bridges the gap between identifying and scaling sustainable soil solutions, resulting in improved household food security and enriched family livelihoods around the world. Using an inclusive approach, IFDC employs locally driven, environmentally sound, and impact-oriented solutions that bring change at local, regional, and national levels.",

    "title": "EP. 16-Inside the C-Suite with Corteva Agriscience's Tim Glenn",
    "content": "Planting season is almost here. So we’re digging in on the topic of agronomy this month, talking to the leaders of some of the world’s foremost providers of agriculture inputs. In this episode of Wherever Jon May Roam, Jon catches up with Tim Glenn, the Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Corteva Agriscience, about how they’ve navigated the roller coaster of the last couple years, what new technologies they’re bringing to bear, and what kind of barbecue they cook up in Alabama. Tim has been in the ag inputs business with Corteva and its heritage organizations for 30 years, and shares insights to help growers maximize their productivity after a roller coaster couple of years in the ag business. Direct Share Link Transcripts Tim Glenn: Twelve months ago, commodity markets were depressed, we had elevated stocks and we had a lot of market uncertainty. Things got to be very concerning about the health of our commodity markets and what the impact was going to be on our farmer customers, and the resiliency, how fast they bounced back was incredible. Dusty Weis: Hello and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big-picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host, association CEO, Jon Doggett. You can join Jon every month as he travels the country on a mission to advocate for America's corn farmers. From the fields of the corn belt to the DC Beltway, we'll make sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: Hard as it is to believe, it's that time of year again when planting is on the front burner, so here at the NCGA, we're digging in on the topic of agronomy this month, talking to the leaders of some of the world's foremost providers of agriculture inputs. In this episode, Jon catches up with Tim Glenn, the executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Corteva Agriscience, about how they've navigated the rollercoaster of the last couple of years, what new technologies they're bringing to bear and what kind of barbecue they cook up in Alabama. But if you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. That way you can take us with you in your truck, your tractor, or on your next trip, and never miss an update from Jon. Also, make sure to follow the NCGA on twitter @NationalCorn and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at ncga.com. Dusty Weis: With that, it's time to once again introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. Jon, here in the Midwest, it's what we like to call mud season. It's that wonderful time of year between when snow melts and when the grass starts growing, and we're just looking out at acres and acres and acres of mud. But for growers, this is the time of year when they start thinking about what they're going to plant in that mud and how they're going to protect that investment until harvest time. Jon Doggett: That's right, Dusty. And the decisions that growers are making right now, have been making for the last several months, that's going to stick with them for the rest of the year. So a lot of interest in what those decisions are going to be and how they're going to be implemented, but here at NCGA, we're going to put an extra focus on agronomy this month, with not one but two podcast episodes, talking to the leaders of the two biggest input producers in the world of agriculture. Our conversation today is with Tim Glenn, the executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Corteva Agriscience. Tim, thanks for joining us. Tim Glenn: Thanks, Jon. Great to be with you today. Jon Doggett: So Tim, you've amassed nearly 30 years of experience in the world of agriculture inputs. Tell us a little bit about your background. We talked before we hit the record button a little bit about a certain football team that you follow, but tell us about that, and how did you come to lead Corteva today? Tim Glenn: Well, over the course of my career, I've never really imagined myself ever working in any industry other than agriculture. From my decision to go to Iowa State and major in agriculture during the depths of the 1980s farm crisis, all the way through my entire working life, it's been my focus. Certainly early interest came from my family and specifically on my father's side of the family, but it's been something that I was drawn to early, and again, I could never imagine working any place else. I spent my career in sales, marketing, and business leadership roles and a couple of years leading our seed production group as well. And as you say, I'm in my 30th year with Corteva, and really proud to have had the experiences over that 30 years that have given me a great perspective on our industry, both here from a US perspective, but also on a global basis. Tim Glenn: I think I'm a little bit unique in my background because I talk about 30th year with Corteva. Corteva is a new company that just came together, and I actually had the opportunity to work in all parts of our heritage organization. So I started my career in Pioneer, and spent my first six years there. I actually spent nine years with Dow AgroSciences, and then came back to work in Pioneer. And then finally, my last role in DuPont was as the leader for the crop protection business in DuPont, and that led us up to the time of the merge between Dow and DuPont. So I had this heritage of this experience of working in all parts of the organization, and now to be a part of the largest US-based seed and crop protection company, with 100% focus on agriculture is really special. And to be able to lead the commercial organization, that's focused on working with farmers and channel partners around the world, I generally say I have the best job in the company. Jon Doggett: You didn't mention football though. Tim Glenn: No, I'm blessed because I grew up in Alabama and, and grew up a Crimson Tide fan, and certainly for the last 13 or 14 seasons, it's never been a better time to be an Alabama fan, and then having gone to Iowa State and spent a lot of my career living in Iowa, like I do right now, I've stayed very close to the Iowa State program, and we're coming off our best season ever. So two top-10 teams as my focus and that's great. I won't talk about my pro team because the Minnesota Vikings let me down this past year. Jon Doggett: Well, I live in the Washington DC area, and we don't have professional sports here, so you're lucky. Tim Glenn: Understand. Jon Doggett: Yeah. So relationship building is everything in agriculture, and certainly Corteva has proved to be a very important partner for us at NCGA. You're on our Ag-Industry Council, you are very generous in your support for our corn Yield Contest with your Pioneer brand. And you folks really stepped up as a partner with us on Commodity Classic this year, and we really, really appreciate that. So tell me, why is it important for a company like yours to support commodity organizations? Tim Glenn: Well, I think the fact that you are farmer led, no one understands the challenges and needs of our farmer customers better than you. Who else is there better to be closely associated with? And you represent growers interest on issues like trade and policy, and really are a powerful spokesperson for the industry, with media and government officials. So we value our relationship very much with NCGA, and other grower groups as well. We want to continue to work together to advocate for policies that support the success of US farmers, and we will do that on our own, and we'll certainly do it in conjunction with you. Tim Glenn: I think the thing that I will emphasize is that no one can underestimate the impact of a farmer's voice on issues. And you collectively, as that industry voice, representing corn growers is incredibly impactful. We'll go out there and we can speak on our own behalf, but at the end of the day, industry has less impact than a couple of farmer voices do on issues around policy. So we really do appreciate your leadership and your role of developing grower leaders that are strong spokespersons for our industry, especially as we've worked together through the global pandemic and obviously just wrapping up a virtual Commodity Classic, and a very successful event at that, I believe. Tim Glenn: And the Yield Contest, you mentioned that, and I'll just say that it's something that we put a lot of pride in, not just because our customers end up winning a lot of contests, but it really is an opportunity to demonstrate what the capabilities are of the genetics that we're putting out there, and the management skills of the farmers. So, while not every farmer is able to replicate those contest yields, what it does do is create that challenge to think about how we can try new tools and practices, so that we can continue to improve year after year. That's why we take a lot of pride in that. And certainly it's fun every year, when we see farmers reach those new yield thresholds. Jon Doggett: So Tim, I have to ask because it's so different from what most people experience in their life, but what's it like leading a Fortune 500 company like Corteva? Tim Glenn: I can tell you when I was starting in this business, like I said, I couldn't imagine ever working any place other than agriculture, but I also couldn't imagine ever being in a senior leadership role, like I am today as part of a corporation like Corteva, but it is exciting. It's exciting because I get to work with some of the best people in the world. We're having a positive impact on agriculture every day, and we have 20,000 people in Corteva, who are 100% focused on the needs of our farmer customers. Tim Glenn: While we're a big organization and certainly it maybe hard for everyone to get their head around what it's like to be a part of a team of 20,000, at the end of the day, it's people who are deeply committed to this industry, have strong roots in agriculture and strong relationships back to the farm today. So we're going to continue to rely on those strong relationships and our great teams to help move forward. But it is a lot of fun. The thing that has never changed over the course of my career is the fact that every day we get to go out there and impact the livelihood of producers around the world, and there's nothing that gets you more motivated than that. Dusty Weis: Tim, leading an organization like Corteva during good times is probably enough of a challenge. But if you look back at the last year that we've been through the pandemic, COVID-19, social distancing, everything being uprooted the way that it was, how do you go about leading an organization like Corteva through something like that? What have you learned as an organization and how has it made you better, would you say? Tim Glenn: It was something that, and we're right at that one-year mark from when things really did change for society. We had drills and practices and preparations for different things, and certainly pandemic was one of those items that we had talked about, but until you go through it, all the preparation in the world really isn't real until you actually have to implement. Tim Glenn: First of all, we had to make sure that safety was our top priority at the start and all the way through the pandemic, especially as we were learning what this meant, and it was the safety of our customers, safety of our employees and all the stakeholders that we operated with. And of course, we had to adapt. You think about when it broke here in the US, that first, second week of March, we were well on our way towards preparing for planting and all the things that our customers were counting on, so we had to make sure that we never lost sight of our farmer customers and that we were continuing to be able to meet their needs through that entire process. Tim Glenn: I'm very proud that despite the incredible headwinds and the challenges, our teams continued to deliver, whether it was being there to answer a customer's needs, making sure that the product was there on time and our supply chains and practices really held up well through that. As we continued on, obviously we were working more virtually internally, but also with our farmer customers as well. So we've been implementing digital tools for some time, and I think what COVID forced all of us to do is really accelerate the timing of that, and so we began to have virtual interactions with our customers that maybe in the past we never would have, and what we found was that we probably touched growers that we would not have been able to. They were able to participate or join events, and farmers who maybe in the past were very reluctant to use technology, all of a sudden they embraced it as well. Tim Glenn: So that's going to carry forward and we'll learn about that. We needed to make sure that they were comfortable and even a thing as simple as a seed delivery, that was typically a very manual process. Somebody shows up at the farm and you're signing a document. That's all been digitized today. So if a customer is less comfortable meeting face-to-face, we have e-commerce solutions that enable that strong relationship to continue, but do it in a way that's more comfortable from a customer perspective. So we're still in the field, we've never backed down, but we're doing things a little bit differently, and our customers have adapted, and as I said, I'm really proud that I don't think we ever missed their expectations through the course of the past year. Jon Doggett: So Tim, what's the most surprising thing about the pandemic and everything that we've been through the last 12 months, both for you personally and for Corteva as a company? Tim Glenn: Well, I think probably the most... Maybe it's not such a surprising thing, but something I'm really proud of is just how quickly we all adapted to the challenge, and then we took it on and then we moved forward. That's inherent in agriculture. We deal with things and we figure out ways to overcome, and that resiliency. 12 months ago, if we would have been talking, we were probably in a situation where our commodity markets were depressed, we had elevated stocks and we had a lot of market uncertainty. Certainly COVID accelerated that, and when you think about ethanol markets being disrupted and feed markets and trade, things got to be very concerning about the health of our commodity markets and what the impact was going to be on our farmer customers, and the resiliency, how fast they bounced back was incredible. Certainly, due to increased demand and some production challenges that happened in different parts of the world in 2020, we've seen a commodity run-up that's created a lot more optimism as we go forward. Tim Glenn: So, the resiliency and the ups and downs, if you sit back and look at what we dealt with over the course of the year, really incredible. I think one other thing I'd pass out there is that I think we all got a little creative in terms of how we develop solutions, and I'll share something that we did at Corteva. The technology we use to develop products is cutting-edge technology, and what we found is that here in Johnston, Iowa, our laboratory technology fit very well with COVID testing. And when you think about the early stages of the pandemic, and we couldn't run enough tests to necessarily decide who was or wasn't at risk, we brought on a capability, and over the course of the year, we've been able to provide a significant amount of the capacity in the state of Iowa on our site here in Corteva for COVID testing. Tim Glenn: We collaborated with hospitals and other healthcare organizations to bring that on, got an approval. Even yesterday, I'm traveling this weekend to go see my parents in Alabama, and I did a COVID test at the office, and it was collected and completed there on site, and it took about four hours for me to get my result back. That's something that, through all the preparations, you could never have imagined, but it also shows the science and technology that we utilize in agriculture and how it can have an impact, even beyond developing the next great corn hybrid or soybean variety. Jon Doggett: It's truly amazing how quickly people across the country in agriculture and outside of agriculture have embraced this technology, and Zoom has entered our nomenclature, and I finally realized here, about two weeks ago that our growers really have embraced this Zoom technology, when one of the older growers I was on a Zoom call with, had to remind me to take myself off mute. So when you reach that point, you know this is going to work pretty good. Jon Doggett: We've reached a point where people are getting their COVID vaccines, and we hope that they are getting their COVID vaccines. We cannot encourage you strongly enough, get your vaccine. But Tim, is it too soon to start feeling optimistic about the future again? As you're looking forward to the year ahead of us in agriculture, what are your expectations for the season and the year, and what's just on the immediate horizon? Tim Glenn: Well, I'm an optimist by nature. I probably wouldn't have lasted 30 years in this industry if I wasn't an optimist, given the uncertainty that we can deal with on a year-to-year basis. It's also one of my favorite times of the year, because we're in that stage where we're getting ready to unleash this machine and we're going to go plant 90 plus million acres of corn and another 90 million acres of soybeans, maybe, so it's easy to get excited about what's going on as we sit here today. Tim Glenn: The good news is, Dusty, while it may be muddy outside there, field conditions are actually pretty nice here in Iowa, and we've had a good run of warm weather and we're past the mud stage here. So we just need to make sure we're closing the window on cold and wet from this point forward. Dusty Weis: I'm jealous. Tim Glenn: Yeah. As I look forward, clearly the rebound of the commodity prices, as I mentioned is a big deal. And I think a year ago, it was easy to be pessimistic about how long was it going to take to work through some of the high carryover stocks that we were seeing on a global basis, and we moved through that really fast and so much better positioned there. I think again the resilience for demanding commodities versus the lows of last year, the ethanol, we're not quite back to where we were before, but it's gotten closer. And certainly, some of the scary things we were seeing where we weren't sure if our livestock producers were going to be able to process animals and what exports, how that might flow. That's gotten back to normal. Tim Glenn: I think the other part is the fact that we've been through this now, and we've been through a full cycle of this, the ups and the downs and the challenges, and we've proven that we can work in new ways, so that's really exciting. The other part is I'm always excited because, every year we get to bring out some new piece of technology, and our customers are always wanting to know what's that next great product that we're going to bring, and we've got tremendous products like Enlist E3 soybeans and Qrome corn hybrids. Our brands, both Pioneer and Brevant are doing well, and just the pipeline, being able to get those products back out there in the field and demonstrate the performance is really exciting. So it's very easy for me to be optimistic this time of year. Jon Doggett: Well, anytime I talk to somebody in the seed industry, there's always a lot of enthusiasm, and gosh, you just take a look at where that seed technology has gone over the last few years. Tim, what would you say are some of the most important advances in seed technology and how have they improved growers margins? Tim Glenn: It's an incredible journey, and I will mention that this year, we're marking the 95th anniversary for the Pioneer brand. So Henry Wallace founded this company 95 years ago, and we were the innovators that introduced hybrid seed corn into the market. So it's a really exciting year for us just because it is a milestone, but we've been at this for a long time as well. And the things over the course of my career, what I've seen is trend yields back in the late '80s were in the low 120s, and as we sit here, a little over 30 years later, trend yields are in the 170s. By the way, we're doing that on 20% more acres than we were back then, so just that productivity, it's not just what you see, it's what you actually feel in terms of our results. Tim Glenn: Clearly, how we develop new seed products has completely changed over the course of my career. We've brought automation, we've brought digital technology into the product development, and so the pace of change, the speed of technology is just incredible. And along with the rate of gain that we've been able to increase, the probability of success of new hybrids and varieties is much greater when we introduce them, because we know so much more about the genetics we're developing today. Tim Glenn: The other thing I would highlight is management practices that farmers are using have continued to improve, whether it's from tillage to improvements across the board from an agronomic standpoint, farmers are able to get more out of that seed and do it in a more sustainable way. Then finally, all this has really been enabled by some new digital technologies. My perspective has always been that farmers are able to make improvements when they can manage details. It's those discreet decisions that they make and how they act upon them that are really important. And today, farmers have more data than they've ever had, and they're in a position to act upon that data and do it in every decision, so they can get the most out of their inputs throughout the season. I believe we're still on the front edge of what's possible in agriculture, so while we've seen, yields continue to improve over the course of history, we're going to see that continue forward, and technology is going to move forward at a faster pace. Tim Glenn: We're investing in building our capabilities that deliver new products and services and information that are going to support farmers' needs, driving productivity and sustainability going forward, and we're doing it as we strengthen our core plant breeding capabilities, biotechnology, crop protection. We're also doing it as we partner with others across the value chain. We're going to partner with our traditional folks in agriculture, but there's also folks outside of agriculture bringing technology and ideas that are going to be really important. So we've made tremendous progress, but that progress doesn't stop and we're going to continue to press on, and I believe continue to accelerate that pace again in the future. Jon Doggett: Well, Tim Glenn, the executive vice president, chief commercial officer at Corteva, what's on the horizon? What's in the pipeline for the next five to 10 years? Tim Glenn: Well, we're committed to research and bringing new technology to market, and that's really what our customers expect, so we've got a full slate of technology. On the crop protection side, we got new formulations and active ingredients that deal with the difficult pests that our customers are always faced with. I'd say that a trend that's coming in that space is that we're really focused on continuing to develop products that are for more natural sources and are considered to be more environmentally sustainable products. I would also expect over the next number of years, that you're going to see more impact from biological products that will compliment our traditional products or potentially bring new solutions to our customers. Tim Glenn: The journey to continue to bring next-generation hybrids and varieties is never over, and so much like I talked about bringing the Enlist weed control system into the market, we're going to continue to bring those new products and new biotechnology traits that not only bring new functionality and value, but also sustain some of the improvements we have, so next-generation corn rootworm traits, as an example, to deal with the long-term risk around resistance. Tim Glenn: Certainly as we come forward, digital offerings are more important every year, and we know that customers are still in, call it the early stages of adopting and realizing value. But we're focused on bringing digital technology that will allow them to make better decisions and get the most value out of the products that we're bringing to them. It's a never-ending journey to develop new products, and obviously continuing to develop new and better practices in conjunction with our farmer customers is important. So agronomy is always going to be critical, and as we have new questions that come up around carbon and new opportunities that may be in front of our customers, we want to be partnering with them to help make sure that they're making the best decisions possible. Jon Doggett: So we've had a number of discussions at NCGA about what's the farmer going to look like in 10, 20, 30, 40 years, and how do we stay relevant as an organization as that next generation, and the one after that takes over the farm? What are you doing at Corteva to stay relevant? Tim Glenn: Well, clearly, as long as I've been around, we've always talked about next-generation producers and we've gone through a long run of consolidation, and no reason to think that we won't continue to have bigger, more sophisticated operations that we'll be working with. We stay close to our farmer customers, and it's their feedback and input that really drives it. Tim Glenn: I think also going forward, we've got to stay close to consumers and maybe more closely connected up and down the value chain, and that is something that's changed a lot. I think that the voices about what we're doing and how we're operating within agriculture are going to continue to be very strong, and we don't have the freedom or the ability just to bury our head and ignore it. So I think the farmer customers who are willing to connect up and down the value chain is going to be important. Farmers who will be willing to continue to change and evolve are going to be critical, and obviously, we're focused on bringing solutions that support those long-term trends that we're facing around biologicals and digital technologies, and helping them get the most out of their nitrogen decisions as well. So it's a never-ending journey, and staying close to the customer and also staying close to consumers is going to be really critical. Jon Doggett: Do you have any advice for us at NCGA in our efforts to stay relevant? Tim Glenn: I think you all do a great job of representing corn farmers here in the US, and also have an international impact as well. And clearly for any one of us, we got to stay focused on the issues that are important to our farmer customers and whether that's trade and market access, clearly that's a global issue. There's only a handful of countries in the world that have the ability to produce an export of this crop, and so making sure that we have good market access for our products on a global basis is absolutely critical. When you think about technology and making sure that technologies are accessible to our customers, not just in terms of approvals here, but approvals around the world, and we really appreciate collaboration with you all to ensure that we've got technology accessibility around the world. Tim Glenn: Also, I would say, just making sure we have sound policies, whether it's coming out of Washington DC, or other bodies that impact our customers, and ranging from the Farm Bill or to anything else that can create opportunities or potentially derail what's happening with our customers. So staying close and representing their interests and needs, and I think also being a beacon in helping communicate back as well is important. Farmers are very independent, and while we have tens of thousands of corn growers who may come together, they also are making decisions independently, and I think that you can also be a tremendous source of information and insight for them as well, as they structure their operations and think about where they go in the future. Jon Doggett: Well, we at NCGA represent corn farmers here in the US, but we work with international organizations and partners a lot. What are you hearing from farmers that you support around the globe in terms of challenges that they're facing? Tim Glenn: Well, a lot of the challenges are the same, and in my job, I get to work with some of the most sophisticated farmers around the world. There's a lot more similarities than differences when it comes right down to it. They have similar concerns, it's about market access, it's about being able to ensure that the products that they're producing are going to be accepted and have free access to markets. So to me, that is absolutely critical. While we will compete with certain markets, when we think about sheriff trade and things like that here in the US, the fact is that the world needs all that we're producing today and whether it's corn or soybeans or other commodities. So it is really important that we have that competition for share of market, but we also respect the fact that we're all a part of the solution in terms of providing feed and fuel for the world. So that to me is absolutely critical. Tim Glenn: I would also say that on a global basis, that question around the consumer connection is really important and making sure that we continue to build that bridge, and also that from an agricultural standpoint, that we advocate and educate what we're doing in a very transparent and collaborative way. I don't think agriculture should be confrontational or adversarial with outside voices. I think we have a real opportunity to do it in a more collaborative way here in the US and around the world. Jon Doggett: We have a great story to tell, and we just need to keep telling it, and telling it, and telling it, and we need to let the farmer voice be at the front of that discussion over and over again. Tim Glenn: And the farmer voice is the most credible voice, absolutely the most credible voice. Jon Doggett: I had that conversation with one of our grower leaders just this morning, and I've been around agriculture all my life so far, but I'm not an active farmer, and that voice is really, really, really important. So that's one of the things we do, and one of the things we're going to continue to do. Tim, last year was a rollercoaster, but let's not forget 2019 was a rollercoaster too. We've had two pretty tough years back to back, but I'm pretty optimistic. What gets you excited about the future of corn and your company's role in that future? Tim Glenn: Well, as I said, it's easy for me to get excited because I see what the future can hold, and I'm excited that the technology that we're bringing will help us to continue to push the limit on what's possible, and whether it's through top-end yields or the impact we can have in terms of sustainable practices, I'm pretty excited about the Yield Contest winners, whether it was David Hula reaching 600 bushels a couple of years ago, or thresholds that were reached this year. Again, while not every producer needs to be setting that as their benchmark, there's things that David does year after year, that allows him to continue to raise the bar that I think every producer can do. I'm also really excited about the opportunity to help bridge the divide that has been emerging between consumers and farmers, and really help society understand the importance of farming and agriculture. And certainly corn here in the US is as important as any crop we have, and should be at the front and center of that conversation we have with consumers. Jon Doggett: It was about a year ago that we were all learning how to do Zoom calls. I had never been on a Zoom call before March, and I didn't know what Zoom was. So this is one of our favorite questions here. If you could Zoombomb anyone, Zoombomb being another new word, just show up unexpectedly on a Zoom call with somebody, who would it be and why? Tim Glenn: That's a great question. Maybe some of the people who are most important in the history of our company, that would be interesting, if you put some of our founders on a Zoom call and how would they do things differently? Whether it's from Henry Wallace, who founded Pioneer in 1926, or some of the great leaders who I learned from as I joined the organization, we all think we're so smart or so modern, or do things so well, but I would be interested to see how those folks who didn't live in the technology-enabled world that we have today, how would they handle things? One of the great things about our company is we have legendary people who came in front of us, who helped make it all possible, and I have enormous amount of respect for them and it would be great to learn some lessons from them in a modern context. Jon Doggett: All right. Tim, I'm going to give you one last opportunity to get yourself in trouble. Tim Glenn: All right. Jon Doggett: What's the best barbecue place in the great state of Alabama? Tim Glenn: If I'm going to a game in Tuscaloosa, just out of tradition, you got to go to Dreamland. I know a lot of people would argue whether that's the best one or not, but that would be probably a game day tradition for us. If I'm visiting my parents in Foley, Alabama, I would say Moe's Original, which is very close by. I'd say it's not necessarily a spectacular barbecue, but it's the place where my parents really like to go. They don't go out a lot anymore, older, but my dad always gets a smile when we have that, and I was already thinking, as I go down there next week, that on Monday evening, I know exactly what he's going to order and I'm going to take him to Moe's for some barbecue. Jon Doggett: And what kind of sauce? Tim Glenn: I'm not a sauce guy, so- Jon Doggett: Oh, okay. This is good to know. Tim Glenn: If I do any sauce, I might do some spicy, but I'm generally not a sauce guy. Jon Doggett: All right. Tim Glenn: So if you make the meat well enough, you don't need the sauce.

    "title": "Senate Confirms Tai for U.S. Trade Representative",
    "content": "The U.S. Senate today confirmed Katherine Tai to serve as U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), overseeing the development and promotion of U.S. trade policy. In her prior role as Chief Trade Counsel for the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, Tai was closely involved in negotiations between the House and USTR to reach an agreement on a U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) implementing bill that received strong bipartisan support in Congress. For generations, America's farmers and ranchers have built strong trading relationships to help maintain a competitive edge in the global economy and bolster job creation across the United States. Today, exports are responsible for 33 percent of U.S. corn farmers’ income and more than 20 percent of the U.S. corn crop is exported annually when accounting for corn and value-added products like ethanol and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). U.S. corn exports for the current marketing year are on track to surpass projections. USDA predicts that 66.04 Million Metric Tons (MMT), or 2.36 billion bushels – of U.S. corn could be exported in the 2020-2021 marketing year. 164 million gallons of ethanol have been exported thus far. NCGA believes now is the time to build on the momentum of recently secured agreements with existing trade partners and forge new free trade agreements with strategic partners, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, that offer new growth opportunities for U.S. corn and corn product exports. There are many trade opportunities for U.S. agriculture, along with challenges such as non-tariff trade barriers that impede corn and corn product market access. NCGA congratulates Ambassador Tai on her confirmation and our farmer leaders look forward to working with Ambassador Tai and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to increase international demand for our product.",

    "content": "Learn more about the Consider Corn Challenge III submission process and find out how successful winners have moved closer to commercialization by participating in the informational webinar scheduled for Tuesday, March 30, 2021 at 10:00 AM CDT. Consider Corn Challenge II winner Derek Wells from ExoPolymer will participate in the webinar to share his experience of the process and the benefits he’s received from participating in the Challenge. “We’ve had very diverse and robust applications and winners from the previous two Consider Corn Challenges, and I am looking forward to seeing who is working on a technology that can utilize field corn as a feedstock for producing sustainable chemicals and products with quantifiable market demand,” said NCGA Director of Market Development Sarah McKay. “Corn is a versatile crop that’s affordable, abundant and sustainably grown. As society continues to be more interested in biobased products, we know we have the solution and that’s corn.” Specific application areas being considered for this Challenge include: Biobased materials from novel mixes of corn-derived plastics Compostable plastics with high tensile strength, such as netting or packaging materials Heavy-duty fuels or drop-in chemicals (e.g., sustainable aviation fuel; biodiesel derived from corn glucose, bunker fuel, etc.) Carbon fiber Other high-value molecules Submissions are due on June 3, 2020 at 4:00 PM CDT. A total prize pool of U.S. $150,000 will be split equally between one to six winners, based on the strength of competing submissions. If all nine winners of the Consider Corn Challenge I & II reached full commercialization with products available in the marketplace, the potential for additional corn demand could be approximately 2.9 billion bushels. You can learn more about the challenge and register for the webinar here.",

    "content": "#Plant21 is just around the corner for many, and already in progress for some, and the excitement for a new start seems even more palpable this year after a trying 2020. While many are eager to get the planters rolling, setting your fields up for success, this year starts with strong weed control. NCGA supports the Take Action program to provide farmers with a variety of resources that make management planning easier before, during and after the growing season. “Weed management has only grown in complexity in the past few years, and it will continue to do so,” says Gary Prescher, NCGA Production Technology Access Action team member and farmer from Delavan, Minn. “With so many considerations farmers must make each season it is important for NCGA to provide tools that make some of those decisions easier.” One such tool is the popular Herbicide Classification chart, recently updated for 2021, which breaks down herbicides labeled for corn and soybean production by site of action. Understanding and rotating sites of action in your herbicide program is critical for preventing or managing the threat of herbicide resistance. A recent webinar from the Take Action program featuring Travis Legleiter, Assistant Extension Professor of Weed Science Research and Education at the University of Kentucky, covers important considerations for selecting proper nozzles under a variety of conditions. Nozzle selection is important for the best possible coverage You can also access a variety of important weed control resources on-the-go thanks to the Take Action mobile app. Take Action is a farmer-focused information platform designed to help farmers and their advisors manage herbicide, fungicide and insect resistance. The goal is to encourage the adoption of management practices that lessen the impact of resistant pests and preserve current and future crop protection technology.",

The U.S. Senate passed the legislation last week, and President Biden is expected to quickly sign the bill into law. The Act includes $7 billion for the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and $15 billion for SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Program. Agricultural businesses have utilized both programs to ensure they can continue to operate during the pandemic. Similar to previous COVID relief efforts, the legislation provides food assistance for those facing hunger through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) food and nutrition programs, including extending the 15 percent increase in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through September 30, 2021. The American Rescue Plan also provides $4 billion to respond to COVID-19 disruptions in the food supply chain and makes long-term investments to increase the resiliency of the food supply in the future. This includes increased food donation, protection for food workers, infrastructure investments, and support for livestock and animal health. Assistance to strengthen rural health care, including assistance for rural hospitals and expanded vaccine distribution, are also included in the legislation.",

    "content": "Over 30 science teachers from across the country participated in the first Nourish the Future: Feeding and Fueling the World, a workshop sponsored by National Corn Growers Association (NCGA). Using supplies mailed to them ahead of time, this group engaged in a variety of lessons to understand more about the science of food production and sustainable fuels. Robyn Allscheid, NCGA Director of Research and Productivity, greeted the teachers and talked about NCGA’s support for education and how she got involved in this career. “We’d like to help students become aware of all the careers related to agriculture,” Allscheid said. “Helping students see what opportunities are out there in agriculture is important to bringing on the next generation of scientists and researchers.” Randy DeSutter, a farmer from western Illinois, serves as the chairman of the Sustainable Ag Research Action Team (SARAT) for NCGA. He praised the teachers for their enthusiasm for learning, as evidenced by their participation in the workshop. DeSutter spoke of the need for students to further science in agriculture. “I have seen yields double in the past 40 years that I’ve been farming because of research and technology,” he said. “And advancements in science and technology are important and necessary to continue moving our industry forward.” Christine Girtain (NJ) presented along with educationprojects.org's Heather Bryan and Jane Hunt. Girtain is currently serving as a Nourish the Future (NTF) teacher leader coach, using her educational expertise to benefit the NTF program. The presentation team led activities from each curriculum area on the NTF website. Amy Aspenwall, another NTF teacher leader coach, provided on-site support. The focus of the workshop was on the role of science in increasing yield for food and fuel and stewarding the environment. “All of these lessons frame up why farmers are using current practices to produce a good crop—everybody eats!” Bryan said. Participants were very engaged and involved in the activities and added their own resources and tips. Patricia Arnold from Texas said, about the soil and water labs: “I wish I would have had these resources in December for my AP Environmental Science class. That was when we covered U5 Land and Water Use. I will definitely use these next year!” Cait Maloy of Ohio appreciated the Understanding Watersheds activity: \"I love the incorporation of the different land uses! That adds so much more depth to the activity.” This workshop will be offered several more times this year.

    "content": "U.S. corn farmers showed stamina and skill in 2020 with a national average yield of 172 bushels per acre and 14.2 billion bushels of corn produced in the United States while facing a myriad of weather-related challenges. To highlight these achievements and all they mean, the National Corn Growers Association delves into the facts about corn production, using a historical comparison in its newest edition of the World of Corn. This statistical look at the corn industry, both domestic and worldwide, features a wide array of information on corn production and usage. In addition to the traditional statistics guide, this year’s distribution includes a poster highlighting the many incredible ways in which corn makes our daily lives possible. “Don’t call it a comeback. America’s corn farmers took some hits in 2020. A record 30 named hurricanes hit the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard. Aggressive wildfires ravaged parts of the western United States. A derecho devasted cropland from Iowa to New Jersey. A global pandemic impacted Americans in rural and urban areas alike. Despite what felt like taking bodywork from a heavyweight, America’s corn farmers ducked, faded, bobbed and weaved to success,” NCGA President John Linder and Chief Executive Officer Jon Doggett note in the introduction. “They rolled with the punches. As the bell rang on 2020, America’s farmers won by a knockout. Truly champions, they stared down adversity, producing a healthy crop to sustainably feed and fuel the world. Take a minute to roll the footage back. America’s farmers may have been on the ropes, but these underdogs go toe-to-toe year-after-year and emerge victorious.” World of Corn is a respected collection of the most important statistics about corn production, exports and consumption, providing key information in a readable format, comparing numbers and trends across the years. Again, this year, NCGA proudly offers an interactive online presentation of the World of Corn that allows users to locate information easily or explore the limitless possibilities the crop offers at their leisure. The format provides improved navigability with an elegant user interface. To explore the World of Corn online, click here. This year’s publication, which Bayer generously sponsored, is distributed through The Progressive Farmer.

    "title": "Growing Exports of Poultry and Egg Products Delivers Value Back to Corn Farmers",
    "content": "Exports of U.S. corn-fed poultry and egg products are one key area of future demand that the Market Development Action Team (MDAT) at NCGA focuses on. The team has funded projects with the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council (USAPEEC), most recently including an economic study on the value of poultry exports to U.S. corn and updates to improved versions of buyer’s guides. The economic study found that poultry exports add $0.28 of value per bushel of corn, which is approximately $4.1 billion in revenue. The new and improved buyer guides for chicken, turkey, and eggs were digitized and updated, including a section on the value and sustainability of U.S. corn. These guides play a large role in securing value back to the U.S. corn grower as they are used at almost all of USAPEEC’s international trade and marketing activities. The partnership with USAPEEC is one poised to enable success for both poultry producers and U.S. corn growers through the support of NCGA’s Market Development Action Team as well as various state commodity associations. The U.S. poultry industry consumes over 1.2 billion bushels of corn and is a key customer of U.S. corn. “As we look toward opportunities to increase demand for corn, U.S. poultry and egg exports is one area we can count on. It’s important to support the work USAPEEC does to get U.S. corn-fed poultry and egg products onto families’ tables around the world,” said Bob Hemesath, chairman of the Market Development Action Team. USAPEEC poultry and egg exports for 2020 were valued at approximately $4.4 billion, with broiler exports up 2 percent in value as compared to the previous year. Mexico remains the top U.S. broiler export market, followed by China, Taiwan, Cuba, Vietnam and Canada. Taiwan is a key market that has experienced record exports as of late, with the U.S. having 93 percent of market share. Vietnam is another area of great interest moving forward for USAPEEC. “The USA Poultry & Egg Export Council (USAPEEC) is extremely grateful for the ongoing partnership that we have with NCGA,” said USAPEEC’s Chief Operating Officer, Greg Tyler. “Without their generous support, USAPEEC would not be able to carry out some of our vital programs around the globe. These programs are essential to the continued growth in exports for the industries we represent and, in turn, allow for increased production in the United States, which means more demand for high-quality feed grains.” USAPEEC also markets U.S. turkey internationally. The majority of U.S. turkey exports go to Mexico, followed by China and Canada. Eggs exports were up 6percent in value as compared to the previous year. The top export markets for table and shell eggs are Mexico and Hong Kong, followed by Canada. Processed egg exports mainly go to Japan, followed by Mexico and Canada. Moving forward, USAPEEC continues to monitor low and high path avian influenza outbreaks and resolve associated trade disruptions. China continues to be an area of opportunity, and South Korea is one of the most promising markets, which USAPEEC is hoping to be further enabled by a recent USDA study on semicarbazide residues levels. This research will be key to allowing more U.S. poultry plants to be relisted as approved for exporting to South Korea. South Africa is another country with opportunity as the U.S. quota continues to increase as consumption requirements of South Africans rise. Finally, India is a huge opportunity market that has recently opened. However, high tariffs continue to limit trade with India, and USAPEEC has made the case to negotiate a tariff reduction of implementation of a tariff-rate quota to USTR.",

    "title": "NCGA Leads Call for Farmer Participation in Paycheck Protection Program",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), along with K·Coe Isom, today led a coalition of 35 agriculture organizations urging Congress to work with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure that farming partnerships and limited liability corporations (LLCs) are able to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). In a letter to the leaders of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and the House Committee on Small Business, the organizations said it is critical for agricultural producers, many of whom have structured their operations as partnerships and LLCs, to receive PPP funding regardless of tax structure. “As you know, farming and ranching are capital-intensive operations often operating at a loss and with owners who frequently do not work for wages,” the organizations wrote. Section 313 of The Economic Aid Act made changes to the initial eligibility requirements for PPP, recognizing the special circumstances of those working in agriculture and helping many farmers and ranchers participate in the program. Unfortunately, the SBA has since interpreted this language to exclude farm and ranch operations structured as partnerships and LLCs. “We believe this interpretation is in error and is preventing many farm and ranch families from participating in the PPP,” the organizations wrote. “We ask that you clarify to SBA that Congress intended to include farm partnerships and LLCs in Section 313.” Click here for PDF of letter.

    "title": "Farm, Biofuel Leaders Embrace EPAs New Position on Tenth Circuits Small Refinery Waiver Decision",
    "content": "Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that it is supporting the Tenth Circuit Court’s January 2020 decision in Renewable Fuels Association et al. v. EPA. After careful review of the decision, EPA’s new leadership agrees with both the court and the biofuel litigants that small refinery exemptions were meant to be temporary and that only pre-existing exemptions may be “extended” by the agency. EPA states that it “agrees with the court that the exemption was intended to operate as a temporary measure and, consistent with that Congressional purpose, the plain meaning of the word ‘extension’ refers to continuing the status of an exemption that is already in existence.” The four petitioners in the case—the Renewable Fuels Association, National Corn Growers Association, American Coalition for Ethanol and National Farmers Union—released the following statement: “Our nation’s biofuel producers and farmers appreciate EPA’s careful review of the Tenth Circuit Court’s decision, and we are pleased the agency’s new leadership is reversing the previous administration’s flawed position on small refinery exemptions. This announcement marks a major step forward by the Biden administration to restore the integrity of the Renewable Fuel Standard and honor the intent of Congress. We wholeheartedly agree with EPA’s conclusion that the small refinery exemption was intended to be a temporary measure and we are pleased to see the agency confirming that only previously existing exemptions may be extended.” Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a request from two refiners to review the Tenth Circuit case, even though EPA did not ask the high court to examine the ruling. Arguments before the Supreme Court are expected in the spring.",

    "title": "NCGA Joins Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance",
    "content": "The Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance (FACA) today announced expanded membership, including the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA). NCGA’s membership in FACA is part of the organization’s commitment to sustainability and support for market-based, voluntary opportunities for farmers to advance environmental goals. FACA consists of organizations representing farmers, ranchers, forest owners, agribusinesses, manufacturers, the food and innovation sector, state governments, sportsmen and environmental advocates. These groups have broken through historical barriers to develop and promote shared climate policy priorities across the entire agriculture, food and forestry value chains. FACA was formed in February 2020 by American Farm Bureau Federation (co-chair), Environmental Defense Fund (co-chair), FMI – The Food Industry Association, National Alliance of Forest Owners, National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, National Council of Farmer Cooperatives (co-chair), National Farmers Union (co-chair) and The Nature Conservancy. In a November report, FACA’s founding members released more than 40 recommendations to guide the development of federal climate policy. The recommendations cover six areas of focus: soil health, livestock and dairy, forests and wood products, energy, research, and food loss and waste. Today, the Alliance announced its policy working groups are producing more detailed and specific proposals focusing on the carbon bank concept, tax credits and other incentives, as well as climate research. The policy working groups continue to uphold FACA’s three principles: Agricultural and forestry climate policies must be built upon voluntary, incentive-based programs and market-driven opportunities; They must promote resilience and adaptation in rural communities; and They must be science-based. More information on FACA and a full list of FACA’s 42 members can be found at www.AgClimateAlliance.com.",

    "content": "Commodity Classic’s pivot from a live show—originally scheduled to take place in San Antonio— to a digital online format has created some unique opportunities, according to the two farmers who are co-chairing the 2021 Special Edition of Commodity Classic. The 2021 Special Edition of Commodity Classic features more than 50 educational sessions that will be delivered digitally direct to farmers across the nation and around the world March 2-5, 2021. Registration is open at CommodityClassic.com and the first 5,000 farmers to register can do so at no charge. Anthony Bush, an Ohio corn farmer and co-chair of the 2021 Commodity Classic, said this year’s digital event provides a platform for the event to bring together top agribusiness executives for a series of live, first-ever Executive Roundtables. “We will hear from CEOs from various stakeholders in our industry. I'm not sure what other venue would exist that we would be able to do this. I think that's going to be pretty exciting to get their perspective on what's going on in our industry right now.” Brad Doyle, an Arkansas soybean farmer and co-chair of the 2021 Commodity Classic, noted that Commodity Classic is created by farmers, for farmers.“ It separates us from just a media-based platform or an industry-based platform because Commodity Classic is farmer-led and farmer-focused. The message is just more sincere and more honest that we, as farmers, get to choose the program, what's in the program, who our speakers are, what content we have.” Doyle added that each year, the farmer committee develops the entire Commodity Classic agenda, including the selection of the educational sessions. “We want this information, too. We want to hear from the speakers. We look at it that way—create a program that will help our fellow farmers. That's the great thing about this show.” Bush said that in a year of incredible challenge, the education at Commodity Classic is more valuable than ever before. “There is so much going on right now in agriculture, just like any other year; but this year the marketing trends can make you or break you right now,” he said. “It's the same way with the equipment purchases and decisions. The people you will be available to connect with at Commodity Classic will be incredibly valuable. I'm really looking forward to it.” Premier Sponsors of the 2021 Special Edition of Commodity Classic are AGCO, Bayer, Case IH, Corteva Agriscience, John Deere and United Soybean Board/Soy Checkoff.

    "title": "Opinion: Cracking the accounting jigsaw of on-farm conservation to grow the profitability of healthy soils",
    "content": "This opinion piece originally ran in AgriPulse While American farmers are trying to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and tough economic conditions, they are also being asked to improve soil health and water quality. Policy and business leaders across the country are setting ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts from food production. But farmers can’t be expected to adopt practices like conservation tillage, cover crops and efficient nutrient management without these practices paying off on their balance sheets. Fortunately, there is growing evidence from farmers who have been able to make sustainable improvements while maintaining or even improving their profitability. Still, agricultural soils are complex, and different conservation practices have different costs, benefits and timelines to return on investment, especially when compared across crop types and geographies. Simply put, a cover crop that worked for a farmer in Iowa may not work for a farmer in Illinois. As interest and investments in agricultural soils grow, it is essential that we have the accounting tools to measure and understand the financial impacts that conservation practices have on the farm bottom line. The uncertainty and complexity surrounding financial decisions about conservation practices should not be underestimated as a barrier to entry. Farmers and their business partners, from lenders to supply chain companies, like to have clear expectations of the costs and benefits that practices like conservation tillage, cover crops and efficient nutrient management will have on farm revenue, operating costs and long-term profitability. But that’s true for all agricultural practices, which are implemented differently for different crops and regions of the country. The only difference is that each state and even subregions of each state have detailed information about conventional practices, their costs and their timing. We don’t have that information everywhere for cover crops, conservation tillage and other in-field conservation practices. Furthermore, some conservation practices have to be measured differently than other annual practices like tillage in terms of their financials. Unlike many practices that have annual costs associated directly with benefits in that year, some conservation practices like cover crops have upfront costs associated with delayed benefits, similar to applying lime. To simplify this accounting jigsaw, Environmental Defense Fund and Soil Health Partnership, an initiative of the National Corn Growers Association, collaborated with researchers to publish a practitioner’s guide for conducting budget analyses for conservation agriculture. Our goal is to help measure and grow the profitability of healthy soils by making robust accounting of conservation practices the norm, not the outlier. Good accounting of agricultural conservation practices isn’t a nice-have, it’s a must-have, especially as Biden’s USDA sets sights on market mechanisms for boosting farmer adoption of practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve water quality. Stakeholders across the value chain that want to see sustainable practices implemented at scale across U.S. agriculture — including USDA, state agencies, food and grain companies, and conservation organizations — need to participate in gathering and sharing information about the financial attributes of these practices, and develop solutions that effectively help farmers adopt these practices profitably. It’s time we make accounting of conservation agriculture commonplace across the U.S. agricultural sector. Our farmers’ futures may very well depend on it. Co-authored by National Corn Growers Association CEO Jon Doggett and Environmental Defense Fund VP of Ecosystems Britt Groosman.",

This analysis and that preceding it based on 2014, 2015 and 2016 sales help make the case for trade as a top priority for U.S. agriculture and the new administration's outreach to the global community. \"Exports are a driver for our economy in general, but nowhere is that more important than in agriculture,\" said Ryan LeGrand, president and CEO of the Council, which works in more than 50 countries to build export markets for U.S. grains and grain products. \"We know that demand today from our overseas customers helps support price and basis for farmers throughout the United States. Demand tomorrow will come from the growing populations in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Putting a dollar figure to the impact that demand has here at home just highlights how important it is to keep working with our customers around the world.\" The study showed in detail the importance of grains exports to the U.S. economy and jobs. It determined the export of grain products supported U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by $27 billion over what would have occurred without such exports, with roughly 295,000 jobs linked directly or indirectly to grain exports. “This look at the economic contributions provided by each U.S. state and 52 Congressional districts will allow NCGA and our corn grower members to effectively demonstrate to lawmakers the need for policies that support U.S. agriculture’s competitiveness around the world,” said NCGA CEO Jon Doggett. U.S. food and agriculture support up to 20 percent of all U.S. economic activity, making the industry one of the country's most important. The grain industry data show the positive impacts of grain exports extend well beyond the farm gate into wholesale trade, real estate, oil and natural gas extraction, and pesticide and chemical manufacturing as well as local hospitals and restaurants supported by dollars that start with agricultural producers. \"Grains exports are a way to bring the wealth of the world home to U.S. farmers' local communities,\" LeGrand said. \"We often tell our farmer members that the world is their market, and this study goes a long way to proving that.” Telling the story of trade’s impact on the farm sector and the wider economy is a critical part of gaining support for trade policy enforcement and development as well as engagement with overseas customers. “Agriculture trade is a great story for the American farmer. We’re optimistic about the many opportunities to expand our trading relationships before us today that will continue to enable U.S. agriculture to be a vital part of the U.S. economy,” Doggett said.",

    "title": "Navigating the Needs of the Nations Inland Waterways System",
    "content": "This past summer and through the fall, many of the locks on the Illinois River underwent major rehabilitation projects upgrading the aging infrastructure. Still, more work is necessary to bring the nearly 12,000 miles of commercially navigable channels and 240 lock sites up-to-date. Members of the Market Development Action Team (MDAT) and Risk Management and Transportation Action Team (RMTAT) had the opportunity to tour the construction sites last fall. The project on the Illinois River had a price tag totaling roughly $200 million. The locks and dams at LaGrange, Peoria, Starved Rock, Marseilles, and Dresden Island were the locations that underwent various construction projects. Tracy Zea, President & CEO of the Waterways Council, Inc., joined NCGA to tour the construction of the locks and dams on the Illinois River. “We currently have 69 locks that are over 80 years old, and each lock is designed to last 50 years,” said Zea. “The upgrades are necessary because it allows our farmers to compete in the foreign marketplace.” The inland waterways system is essential to getting U.S. corn to export, with more than 60 percent of the grain produced in the U.S. being transported by barge. “This navigation industry serves many partners and stakeholders,” said Tom Heinold, Chief of Operations for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Rock Island District. “Ultimately, the economy of this nation runs on this river. We are in the middle of the world’s breadbasket, growing corn and soybeans. We have this amazing transportation system right through the middle of our nation where we are able to efficiently get that product up and down the river.” Heinold went on to say how important partnerships are, especially those with the corn growers. “It’s partners like the corn growers that know the importance of this system for the economy and can see work like this and know the value of it and the return on investment. It’s our stakeholders that can help us argue for funding on projects just like this.” The MDAT and RMTAT funded this project. You can view a series of new videos on the Illinois River rehabilitation project that includes interviews with Zea, Heinold and Illinois farmers Bill Leigh and Terry Smith and Colorado farmer Troy Schneider.",

    "title": "Senate Shows Support for Ethanol",
    "content": "A flurry of positive action in support of renewable fuels took place in the U.S. Senate this week. On Wednesday, Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, led a letter signed by 13 other farm-state Senators to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to highlight the “pressing concern of restoring integrity to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and to alert you to pressing policy decisions that the Administration must make to bring regulatory certainty to the transportation fuels sector of the economy.” Also, Wednesday, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., along with Klobuchar, reintroduced the Adopt GREET Act, legislation that would require the EPA to update its greenhouse gas modeling for ethanol and biodiesel. “This bill will ensure EPA uses the most recent science and data to accurately measure the greenhouse gas emission reduction benefits of ethanol,” said NCGA President John Linder, president of the National Corn Growers Association. “The Department of Energy’s GREET model clearly shows ethanol is a key carbon reduction solution, resulting in significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline. Corn farmers thank Senator Thune and Senator Klobuchar for their leadership and look forward to working together to enact this legislation and take steps to advance greater use of low-carbon ethanol.” Earlier in the week, during his Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee confirmation hearing, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack expressed his support for expanding the use of higher blends of biofuels. \"General Motors, Ford — they're not going to stop producing cars with internal combustion engines, so we need an alternative fuel source to complement electric. Over a long period of time, we're going to need both. We're going to promote biofuels octane capacity. One way to do that is to promote higher-blend biofuels used in higher-efficiency new engines,” Vilsack told the Committee. In his confirmation hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, EPA nominee Michael Regan pledged his support for ethanol and agriculture. “You have my commitment that we will take a look at the RFS program and we will introduce some transparency into that program,” Regan told the Committee. NCGA appreciates the continued advocacy and support for renewable fuels from members of the U.S. Senate and looks forward to a productive relationship with both Vilsack and Regan upon their Senate confirmation.",

    "title": "EP. 15-Going Whole Hog to Serve Our Pork Customer: A Conversation With National Pork Board CEO Bill Even",
    "content": "The U.S. pork herd consumed over 1.2 billion bushels of corn in 2020. Not only does that make the pork industry a key customer segment for NCGA’s growers, but many of the same trade and sustainability issues that we grapple with in corn impact them as well. So in this episode, NCGA CEO Jon Doggett chats with Bill Even, CEO of the National Pork Board, to review some of the cooperative efforts the two groups have underway, the challenges they face and the opportunities that await if they work together. They also recount some of their favorite mouthwatering pork dishes. Spoiler alert: bacon is involved. Direct Share Link Transcript Bill Even: We've got producers out there that are paying the corn checkoff, they're paying the soybean checkoff, and they're paying the pork checkoff, and what they're expecting out of their respective boards and their respective staffs of these organizations is that they work together and share those checkoff dollars around and don't duplicate things and be inefficient. That's no different than how you run your own farm operations. Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host, association CEO Jon Doggett. You can join Jon every month as he travels the country on a mission to advocate for America's corn farmers. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway, we'll make sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: The U.S. pork herd consumes 900 million bushels of corn a year. Not only does that make the pork industry, a key customer segment for our growers, but many of the same trade and sustainability issues that we grapple with in corn impact them as well. And so in this episode, we welcome Bill Even, CEO of the National Pork Board, to review some of the cooperative efforts we have underway, as well as some of our favorite mouthwatering pork dishes. Spoiler alert: bacon is involved. If you haven't yet, make sure that you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. That way, you can take us with you in your truck, your tractor, or on your next trip, and never miss an update from Jon. Also, make sure you follow the NCGA on Twitter @NationalCorn and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at NCGA.com. Dusty Weis: And with that it's time to once again introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. And Jon, in the world of business, there's a lot of talk about the value chain, but in our field, it's as much a food chain as it is a value chain. The NCGA has important partners throughout that chain, including leaders in other ag sectors, where corn serves as the primary livestock feed. Jon Doggett: That's right, Dusty, and what happens to the corn industry has ripple effects across a lot of other industries, our customers, whether they're in the beef business, the dairy business, poultry, raising chickens, or like the subject we're going to talk about today, the pork industry. So it's important that we work closely with all of our partners to make sure that we're all thriving together, even during these very strange and unpredictable times. Jon Doggett: Our guest this week is Bill Even, the CEO of the National Pork Board. Bill is a long-time leader in agriculture, and he is a fourth generation farmer himself, and I'm going to let him introduce himself just a little bit more. Bill, first of all, thank you for joining us on Wherever Jon May Roam. Bill Even: Thanks very much, Jon. I really appreciate the opportunity, and yeah, I'm the CEO of the National Pork Board, also known as the Pork Checkoff, located here in Des Moines, Iowa. And as you mentioned, we have now a fifth generation family farm in southeast South Dakota where we raise corn, soybeans, some small grain, hay. We have a cow-calf operation and also a small farm equipment repair business, and we also sell seeds, so seed corn, soybeans, and the like. So deep roots in agriculture, and I'm a partner with my brother and my son in that operation. Jon Doggett: Bill, I want to bring the pork segment into context for our listeners real quick as we get started, so give us a quick overview of the U.S. pork industry. How big is it? Who's involved? Where are they involved? Bill Even: Yeah, absolutely, so when you look at the USDA Census of Agriculture, it shows there are about 60,000 people that actively own hogs, raise hogs in one shape or form. Now, of that, our industry has certainly changed over the past 30 years, much like many farm operations have. And so you probably have, if you look at the Successful Farming Pork Powerhouse list, you've got the top 40 production systems, many of whom are large family operations. They have about, I would say 65% of the hogs in the United States. Bill Even: Here at the Checkoff, we're responsible for everyone. Doesn't matter if you're with a 4-H project and you've got some pigs that you're raising on your farm with your kids all the way up to very large production systems that may be multinational in character. And we collect those dollars, the checkoff dollars. It's 40 cents of every hundred dollars of value of pig sold in the United States, and then we spend those dollars on research, promotion, and education. Bill Even: The pork industry itself, it's got a variety of actors. A matter of fact, our board president has a very successful pasture-raised pork operation down in northern Arkansas and sells his products directly to consumers and to the restaurant industry. Also on our board of directors, we have people from very large integrator companies as well that are actively involved in the packing industry, so our 15-member farmer board's also pretty diverse, Jon, and we take a lot of pride in being responsible to help everyone. Jon Doggett: Bill, what are some of the things you're hearing from your producers? Here we've had the pandemic, and we've had all sorts of trade disruptions. What are you hearing from them in the last, say, 30 days or so? Bill Even: Well, the number one thing is everybody was happy to see the calendar turn over to 2021. 2020 was not a fun year for any of us in society, agriculture in particular. And what the producers are focused on now is, number one, making sure that the production plants, the processing plants and the packers are operating. We had some really dark days last spring, Jon, that put a lot of pressure on our industry. Now, most of the packing industry is operating in that, oh, somewhere 97, 98% operational capacity, which helps. And that's good for consumers because that means the animals are getting from the farms to the processors and then on to the grocery stores. Bill Even: I think the other issue that folks are focused on right now is certainly profitability. Doesn't matter what you raise in agriculture, we are price takers, so we go into the market and say, \"What will you give me for it?\" And as producers, right now, they're looking at pretty decent opportunities maybe to hedge. The issue that we've run up against, as you've noted, is the strong increase in corn and soybean prices with a lot of pull from the export markets in particular. That's put pressure on margins right now. You could probably look back to where we were, Jon, maybe a decade ago, and producers having similar questions as how do I manage the cost of my inputs, which in this case, primarily 60% of the cost of raising a hog is related to feed. Jon Doggett: Sixty percent. What are the biggest needs right now? If you could snap your fingers, what are the two or three problems that are in the forefront beyond those margins and that profitability? Bill Even: I would say first is on the trade front. We export just under 30% of U.S. pork production. And if you look back, say, to about the mid-nineties, we were a net pork importer in the United States, and the series of free trade agreements that we got put in place around the world that our government worked on diligently really has allowed the U.S. pork industry to expand and grow over those intervening 30-plus years. And so trade is critically important. Bill Even: And I'd say the next piece is certainly on the regulatory front, wanting to make sure that as we figure out what's our role in understanding sustainability, making sure that, I would say our elected officials and certainly the producers themselves, really understand what's the role that we're going to be expected to play as pork producers. And Jon, as you and I both know with our partnership, corn and soybeans and pork are very tightly tied together, and so where we happen to go is going to be very dependent on where the corn and soybean industry happens to go there. Jon Doggett: What I also would like, Bill, is can you talk about your trust in protein platform and explain to us what does that do? Bill Even: It's about a strategy. It's not a tagline. It's about what do we in the pork industry, the beef industry, the poultry industry, and corn and soybean industry all need to get aligned around. And I'll throw in dairy as well as eggs, right? Coming from the milk and the poultry side. We look at today's U.S consumer, and they're looking for transparency, and they're looking for information around sustainability, health, and nutrition. And unfortunately, there are those out there that raise questions about nutrition, and where's meat part of a healthy diet. They raise questions about sustainability. Are corn and soybean farming and manure application, is that somehow harming the environment? Bill Even: And they ask questions about animal welfare and how are the pigs being raised in the United States. And so, Jon, I think you'd take this kind of this trust in animal protein umbrella, and we've got a plan underway with a number of the people I just mentioned to really step back and say, \"How do we need to engage the consumer in the year 2021 and help them answer those questions with confidence?\" Bill Even: And so Trust in Animal Protein is really about meeting the consumer where they're at. And the Pork Board and the Pork Checkoff, we've had now going on a four-year partnership with Google, and we're using our understanding of what people are searching for in real time. It could be, \"How do I cook a pork chop?\" Or it could be, \"Tell me more about how pigs are raised.\" We need to be able to provide those answers in real time with people that are fact-based. And in a world where you can get anything that you want on your smartphone and probably half of it is inaccurate, I think our job here at the checkoffs are to make sure that there's a trusted voice out there in the midst of all that confusion. And that's part of what Trust in Animal Protein is about as well. Dusty Weis: Bill, I'm curious, if I went and plugged, \"Why is bacon so delicious?\" into Google, what would I get back? Bill Even: I think it's because it's made with angel dust, I believe. We always say bacon's the gateway drug for vegetarians, so we've got flavor going for us, and like anything else ... And the flip side, you've got pork loin, which is incredibly affordable. It's a great lean cut of meat, and it's very versatile and easy to cook. And when we've had consumers stuck at home with a pandemic now for the better part of a year, helping people understand how to cook, that was another major effort we did in 2020 and we're continuing in 2021 because when your favorite restaurant or sports bar is closed and you can't go in there and get your snacks or get your meal, we found out really quickly that a lot of consumers were in Google just asking, \"How do I cook?\" And so we spent a lot of our marketing budget just helping answer those basic questions. Dusty Weis: Jon, up around where I'm from, bratwurst, of course, is a staple, both in the parking lots of your favorite sports venues, but also around the house. But I've got to ask you, what's your favorite pork product? Jon Doggett: Oh, gosh. I'd say a really good, thick pork chop, grilled and maybe like a cranberry sauce or something. Something tart to go with it. Or sauerkraut. I'm still German enough, still eat a lot of sauerkraut. Don't get me started. It's not lunchtime yet, Dusty, and you're going to get me started. Dusty Weis: Yeah, we've got to stop recording these before lunch here. Jon Doggett: Yeah. Yeah, we do. Dusty Weis: Bill, what about you? Favorite pork product. Bill Even: I am a big fan of pulled pork. Now, I admit, I am a lousy cook. My wife, Janelle, is fantastic. She's got a Traeger, She's got a grill, she's got a nice kitchen, and she loves to cook, and my waistline shows it. But on this point, and I think something worth mentioning here is Jon mentioned a nice, thick pork chop center of plate. There's a number of people that still love their pork that way. But we also are recognizing that pork is an ingredient, along with sometimes center of plate, is really where we need to be. Bill Even: And we look at our Hispanic market in the US. You've got a base of about, what, 60 million people with Hispanic origin in the US today? The growth rate expected of our Hispanic population is around 160% between now and 2050, and they love pork. They love our product. And so you've got a built-in customer base that's growing, but they tend to eat pork maybe a bit differently than I would, and growing up in the Midwest with that center of plate cut. And so a lot of the work we're doing is in Spanish and deep into the Hispanic markets, just making sure that we're meeting their needs and answering their questions. They have more health-related questions, and if we're able to answer those, it really helps keep them as customers. Dusty Weis: Bill, to that point, I actually had the pleasure of living in Miami, Florida for a little while, and of course, Miami has a very strong Cubano population down there. And one of the funniest pictures that I ever saw was something that one of my coworkers down there snapped while he was driving to work on the Shula Expressway, and it was the car in the lane next to him, sporty little Miata with the top down, and seat-belted into the passenger seat was an entire lechon, a great big pig ready for the spit roast wrapped in a plastic bag that somebody just seat-belted right into that passenger seat, and away they went down the Shula. It's definitely a market segment for you guys. Bill Even: Well, and we actually, as you mentioned that, Dusty, we took our board of directors to Miami literally a year ago in January, so January 2020, and we spent three days there deep in the Hispanic community with restaurants, with distributors, with grocery stores, with consumers. And I tell you what, it's very important. Jon knows this as well. Very important to get our board members out of what you call kind of the pork or ag echo chamber and get to, whether it's Miami, get to New York, get to Seattle, get to San Francisco, really understand the consumer segment out there that's buying our product. And often, they don't look like us, and they may speak a different language than us, but they love our product, and so it's our job as marketers to make sure we know them. And I've had the pigs, both in Miami as well as here in Des Moines, Iowa, and it goes really great with a beer in the afternoon, too. Dusty Weis: It certainly does. Jon Doggett: Unaccustomed as you are, huh? Bill Even: Unaccustomed as I am of having a pulled pork sandwich and a cold beer. Jon Doggett: Bill, I was looking up some figures here. It's been a couple of years ago, but interestingly enough, the state with the fastest growing Hispanic population as a percentage of the population is your home state of South Dakota, which I think is really kind of interesting. And a lot of those people that came to South Dakota are working in those meat packing plants and in other places in agriculture, so it's so interesting how it's a big circle here. We're all kind of interconnected one way or another, and as we bring those folks in to work in meat packing plants, they're coming in with new tastes and developing new markets. Jon Doggett: Let's talk about another market, and I have experience with this twice, I've done it twice, and that is Beyond Meat. And I have had two of their burgers. Where's the pork industry on this? Are you guys concerned about this? Bill Even: Yeah, you're talking about alternative proteins, whether it's cultured product or perhaps a processed protein product that's plant-based. Here's where we land. We talk about real pork. And so what do I mean by that? We're real farmers on real farms raising real pigs that's real food. Our ingredient list is one word, and it has four letters: P-O-R-K. And when you get in today's consumer that's looking for clean labels, simplicity, easy-to-understand, minimal ingredients, we're really confident of the story that we have to tell. And frankly, we're pretty proud of it, as well. Not only are we raising real pork, but we've got real nutritional value. Bill Even: As we've talked about, Jon, the work we're doing with you is helping show real sustainability and sustainable improvement. You can talk about being really versatile, really affordable. That's really where we land on all this. This is the United States, and we're in capitalism, and we do expect and anticipate that when you're in a market-leading position... So when you're king of the mountain, you're always going to have people coming after you trying to grab some of that market share and grab some of that affinity. And frankly, we welcome the competition because we're glad of who we are and what we do. Bill Even: I think the bigger issue, and I've had this conversation with Kevin Ross on your board of directors, Jon, is where do we go around handling what mom always told you to do? How do you eat your meat and vegetables? And I think when you really look at the opportunities for the meat industry to figure out, not on this highly processed, unpronounceable sort of things that we might be dealing with, but how do you really ensure that people are eating that balanced diet, which is going to include meat, is going to include your vegetables. I think there's going to be some creative ways coming up forward on that that the public hasn't seen yet. And so it's not about eat this, not that. It's really about how are you eating healthy? And I think that's a much more honest way to approach the conversation with the consumer. Dusty Weis: Bill, I wanted to ask you, you alluded to what a challenging year 2020 was for everybody, but especially for pork farmers. And I've heard it said that 2020 was the year where the imperative was to adapt, pivot, and overcome. And so what were some of the challenges that were posed to the pork industry specifically by the COVID pandemic, and how did you overcome those challenges? Bill Even: If you wind the clock back to March, and it was literally right around St. Patrick's Day when many of the states started shutting down and sending people home, that was kind of a turning point. And it was shortly after that, as you started to get into early April and we saw COVID starting to spread across the United States, various businesses, various communities in the country, and it started to impact the processing industry and the food industry. Bill Even: I clearly remember it was Easter Sunday a year ago when the wheels really started to come off the wagon, and we started to see the domino effect of processing plants starting to close. And as you folks may know, the pigs don't stop growing. The sows don't stop farrowing. And so you have this just-in-time supply chain that's designed to keep the grocery stores stocked, and suddenly, that mid-point in that supply chain processing started to grind to a halt. And at one point, by the time we got to early May, right around corn planting time in the upper Midwest, we were operating maybe at 50% capacity in the United States, and so we had this massive backlog of animals on farms at the same time you had grocery store shelves going empty. Bill Even: And it was a very, very difficult time for our producers. As you folks may have also heard, we had some producers doing the unthinkable, where they had to actually go out and euthanize perfectly healthy market-ready animals and try to dispose of them. We spent a lot, a lot of time in the spring last year working with states, state veterinarians, and producers, trying to just figure out how do we do this in a humane fashion for the animals, Dusty. And candidly, how do you do it in a humane fashion for the people? Bill Even: I had a producer call me up one day and he said, \"Bill,\" he said, \"I am just sick to my stomach. We've got a barn that we've just got nowhere to go.\" And he said, \"We've got 3000 head of hogs in there.\" And he said, \"I can't ask by employees to do it.\" So he said, \"I'm taking my boys out, and we're just going to have to deal with us ourselves.\" Bill Even: Those were very trying times in the pork industry. But I will say, farmers are great improvisers, and we worked with state officials, in particular, state by state, trying to allow some emergency double-stocking of barns, reduce feed rations and the like to kind of limit feed the diets. And thank goodness it never materialized at the scale we were afraid it was going to, but overall, again, no one was more happy to see 2021 than I think pork producers to get that year put behind us. Dusty Weis: And Bill, Jon alluded to it a little bit earlier, but pork is an important customer segment for corn farmers. They're partners, really, in agriculture. But just what are we talking about here? Can you quantify exactly how important pork is to the corn industry? Bill Even: Absolutely, and we're really proud of that partnership. Many of our pork producers are active grain farmers themselves raising corn and soybeans. I did look up some numbers here to answer that question. And right now, when you look at the U.S. pork herd in total in the latest year we have numbers for in 2019, we're about 900 million bushels of corn that we're consuming, and around 250 million bushels of soybeans in the form of soybean meal. And so we are just shy of a billion bushels of the U.S. corn crop is consumed by hogs in this country. Bill Even: And as I mentioned earlier, a large part of what we do and a large part of the pork industry's environmental footprint is directly tied to what's happening on those row crop acres of corn and soybean farmers, so we're really joined at the hip. And I think that's the important part that I really want to get across on this podcast is that we've got to work together as an industry, and Jon and the National Corn Growers Association have been great partners, really, on issues related to sustainability, as well as trade. Jon Doggett: Bill, you're absolutely right. We are so closely aligned. You're not only a customer, but again, many of your members are our members, and we do all need to work together. And you brought up the term sustainability. We are doing a lot in the Corn Growers on sustainability. How important is that to your industry? What are you doing? What could we do more of in our industry? Bill Even: Well, and I've got to credit the leadership of NCGA and Jon and the team there. It was probably well over three years ago now that the leaders from the pork industry, the corn industry, and the soybean industry sat down and their farmer leaders signed a memorandum of understanding that we were going to share information and partner with our checkoff research dollars in the area of sustainability research. And big kudos to the National Corn Growers, and I've got a list of a few things here I should just mention, Jon. Bill Even: We've just completed this life cycle harmonization research with corn and soy and pork out of the University of Arkansas. We've worked on joint organizational goals related to sustainability. Both Jon, your team, and particularly Nathan Fields, who's directly working with us at the Pork Board. We've got work underway to build a draft feed supply blueprint so that we really understand how that comes from the crop acre up through the pigs and then on to the consumers. And then we've got kind of a corn, pork, soy sustainability initiative that we're working on as well. So those are just tangible examples, Jon, of how your organization has leaned in and partnered with us in a fantastic fashion. Jon Doggett: Well, Bill, and we asked you some months ago to participate in our market recovery plan, and we appreciate the fact that you came to those meetings and participated. And for those who don't know, we put together a group of our customers to talk about what can we do over the next five years to increase corn demand? We took that question to our customers, which was interesting because not only do we continue to be focused on the longterm, but we were looking more at the short term. What are those base hits can we hit? Bill, you and I both learned a lot, I think, in that. I can't remember who it was that was talking about cold storage and the need for cold storage overseas. We just heard a lot of little things here, there, and the next place, little things that we can do that, over time, and you add enough of them together, we might actually have something that we can work with. What did you get out of that process? Bill Even: Well, I think first is the acknowledgement, leadership, and courage it took for the National Corn Growers Association, in the middle of a pandemic, to essentially stop some of the work you were working on and say, \"We're going to do a really good formal assessment so that we can act in real time.\" And you did bring together a great deal of the supply chain to talk about that, a lot of your customers. Bill Even: I'd say one of the things that I think we need to acknowledge is the support that the corn industry has given the U.S. Meat Export Federation. As I mentioned earlier, we export nearly 30% of U.S. pork production, and state corn grower associations, National Corn Growers Association, have always been good supportive partners of the U.S. Meat Export Federation. And that organization based out of Denver, that pork and beef and lamb all are tied into, really are our eyes and ears on the ground internationally and help us move product in the global market space. So I think that's an important point that came out of that discussion is the importance of the trade of meat. Bill Even: I'd say the other piece is really understanding, as you look at your end users, Jon, right? You've got the livestock, the feed side of the equation. You've got the industrial human commercial use components, and you've got the ethanol industry and you've got exports. Now, traditionally, there's been a bit of a tension, I would say, between the livestock industry and the corn industry, going back a decade around the area of corn use for ethanol. And I think an example of us trying to put that in the rear view mirror is the work that you did, Jon, with that strategic planning initiative because we sat shoulder to shoulder with all these various end users and worked collaboratively to come up with some ideas on how we made sure the U.S. corn farmer was going to remain in business and be successful. And it's going to take all these different components, livestock, fuel, end use, and exports, for row crop farmers just like myself in order to stay in business. Jon Doggett: Well, and I would point out, I will correct you slightly in that you weren't sitting shoulder to shoulder at most meetings. We were socially distanced, and everyone was wearing their mask. Dusty Weis: Figurative shoulders. Jon Doggett: Figuratively. Dusty Weis: Figuratively, right. Jon Doggett: Yes, so Bill Even, CEO of the National Pork Board. What are the threats on your radar screen? What are the things that keep you, if not laying awake at night, at least maybe getting up a little earlier in the morning? Bill Even: Well, the number one issue for us, and it should be for corn growers as well, is the threat of foreign animal disease, particularly African swine fever. And so if you look at the global pork industry, half of all the hogs in the world are in China. And when African swine fever broke out in China two and a half years ago, half of those pigs are dead. And so we've lost over a quarter of the world's pork supply in about 24 months. That's a demand issue for corn growers as well, as well as a supply issue for consumers, particularly in Asia. Now, it's important for your listeners to note, African swine fever, it's a disease of pigs and not people, and pork is safe to eat. And this is really, it's an animal health and welfare issue that we're trying to deal with globally. Bill Even: Now, African swine fever, thank God, knock on wood is not in the United States. It's not in North America. And that's probably the number one thing that we're worried about, Jon, a trade limiting foreign animal disease that's going to harm our animals. Put it this way. If we would have it break out in the United States, our export markets would immediately close. We would have 30% more pork sitting here onshore in the United States, and you know what that's going to do to prices. And you also know what that's going to do to the demand side of the equation. So that 900 million bushels of corn, that number starts to decline really rapidly, and suddenly, what's our problem becomes corn's problem, become soybean's problem, and then becomes a state problem with tax revenue and the terrible economic fallout that would come from that. That's probably the number one thing that we're worried about, Jon. Jon Doggett: Certainly, all we'd have to do is look at some of the things that have happened in other countries or other sectors of the livestock industry. Poultry certainly has had their problems with some diseases running through chicken houses. Pretty scary stuff. And I really have to say, my hat is off to the U.S. pork industry because I know that you have pushed very, very hard and been very diligent in keeping what's a pretty nasty disease out of your herds here in this country, and so congratulations and thank you. We appreciate everything you've done in concert with our organization over the years. But as we wind this conversation down, I'm curious to know what can we do as the corn industry to better support our pork customers? Bill Even: First off, keep raising corn, right? That's important, right? We love to have the domestic supply. Jon Doggett: And Bill, I am not going to promise cheaper corn prices for you. I want you to know that right off the bat. Bill Even: Well, as long as you promise higher hog prices, I think we'll be fine. Jon Doggett: Done. Bill Even: With that settled, to answer your question, Jon, where do we go from here? Jon, you and I don't take these jobs if we don't believe in the checkoff and what they do for producers. We wouldn't be here if that wasn't the case. And what we've been able to demonstrate with corn and soy in particular is a real understanding. It's going to take partnerships. We've got producers out there that are paying the corn checkoff, they're paying the soybean checkoff, and they're paying the pork checkoff, and what they're expecting out of their respective boards and their respective staffs of these organizations is that they work together and share those checkoff dollars around and don't duplicate things and be inefficient. Bill Even: That's no different than how you run your own farm operations. And so remembering who we are and where we come from, not get above your raising, as it's said, is going to do us good stead going forward. So that continued, I would say, collaborative work, particularly in the area of sustainability. We're very close to having the carbon neutral pig. So there's a really great bright future in front of us here, but it's only going to happen if we're working really closely with the corn growers.

    "title": "Study Shows Precision Agriculture Improves Environmental Stewardship While Increasing Yields",
    "content": "Association of Equipment Manufacturers Releases “Environmental Benefits of Precision Agriculture” Study and Encourages Adoption of New Technologies The Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), in partnership with the American Soybean Association, CropLife America, and National Corn Growers Association, released a study quantifying how widely available precision agriculture technology improves environmental stewardship while providing economic return for farmers. Precision agriculture leverages technologies to enhance sustainability through more efficient use of critical inputs, such as land, water, fuel, fertilizer, and pesticides. Farmers who use precision agriculture equipment use less to grow more. The study highlights how policies and technological advancements can help farmers increase these outcomes. “We are living in a new age of agriculture, and today’s precision technology on equipment can have an enormous positive impact on farmers and the environment,” said Curt Blades, Senior Vice President of Agriculture at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers. “One of our goals at AEM is to encourage the adoption of these technologies by more farmers, so they can all reap the benefits as we continue to focus on sustainability.” Environmental Benefits The study explores five key environmental benefits achieved through precision agriculture technology adoption, including: Yield benefit through increased efficiency Fertilizer reduction by more precise placement Pesticide reduction by more accurate application Fuel savings due to less overlap and better monitoring Water savings through more accurate sensing of needs “Over the past 18 years, the growth in corn and soybean yields, for example, has coincided with the widespread adoption of precision agriculture technologies,” said John Linder, National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) President. “As precision agriculture technologies become more widely adopted, there is the potential for significant upward movement in yields and savings.” Part of Climate Answer “The reductions in greenhouse gases this study illustrates shows modern agriculture is part of the climate solution,” said Kellie Bray, CropLife America (CLA) Chief of Staff. “Fuel savings alone due to precision ag tools is the yearly equivalent of taking nearly 200,000 cars off the road, all while preventing an area equal to 4.5 Yellowstone National Parks from being added to production because of yield increases.” Study Highlights As precision agriculture equipment and technologies are more widely adopted it will lead to significant increases in yields and further input savings: Significant increases in yields and further input savings can be reached as precision agriculture technologies become more widely adopted: Productivity has increased an estimated 4% and has the potential to further increase 6 percent with broader adoption. Precision agriculture has improved fertilizer placement efficiency by an estimated 7 percent and has the potential to further improve an additional 14 percent. Herbicide use has been reduced by an estimated 9% and has the potential to further decrease 15 percent at full adoption. Fossil fuel use has decreased an estimated 6 percent with the potential to further decrease 16 percent. Water use has decreased an estimated 4 percent because of current precision agriculture adoption with the potential to further decrease 21 percent at full adoption. Overcoming Barriers “Soybean growers know from experience that precision agriculture contributes to both short-term and, importantly, long-term yield, environmental, and economic benefits, and this study helps quantify that progress,” says Kevin Scott, South Dakota soy grower and American Soybean Association (ASA) president. “But if we want to get to full adoption of the technology—and realize the immense industry-wide gains in yield and input savings—we still have a lot of work ahead of us.” AEM, ASA, CLA, and NCGA are working together to advance technologies and practices that will bring pledge to work together on ideas that will bring the potential the study highlights to fruition: Promote policies that incentivize innovations in agricultural production Improve the infrastructure that makes precision agriculture possible, including wireless broadband over croplands and rangelands Grow farm income so producers have capital to invest in their operations Increase consumer communication about the environmental benefits of precision agriculture To receive a copy of AEM’s Precision Agriculture study, please contact Nick Tindall.

    "title": "Consider Corn Challenge III Contest Looks to Establish Novel Biomaterials, Products, and Technologies Utilizing Corn",
    "content": "The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is launching the Consider Corn Challenge III open-innovation contest, looking for participants to answer the call and submit proposals for new uses of field corn as a feedstock for producing sustainable chemicals and products with quantifiable market demand. “Corn is an affordable, abundant, sustainably grown crop that has a myriad of uses and applications, which is why we are holding our third Consider Corn Challenge contest,” said NCGA Market Development Action Team (MDAT) Chair and Iowa farmer Bob Hemesath. “Corn’s cost as a feedstock has benefited greatly by improvements in technology, production and logistics efficiency. With society’s interest in more biobased products, we know we have the solution and that’s corn.” Previous winners of the Consider Corn Challenge contests have scaled up to the next phase of development, received additional grant funding, entered into joint agreements, and obtained registration for state biobased production incentives. “As a past recipient of the Consider Corn Challenge award from the NCGA, we have been able to deepen our technology base regarding the differential properties of our novel materials,” said Derek Wells with ExoPolymer. “Due to these efforts, we are currently investigating several targeted market applications and feasibility studies at scale. The CCC award also helped to put a spotlight on our innovative approach, enabling us to raise additional funding and continue our progress. We are grateful for the recognition by the NCGA and are looking forward to further applying our technology for additional valuable uses of this important agricultural product.” If all nine winners of the Consider Corn Challenge I & II reached full commercialization with products available in the marketplace, the potential for additional corn demand could be approximately 2.9 billion bushels. “Corn farmers continue to take advantage of the technology that allows them to grow a bigger crop on less land with less resources per bushel, and that means there’s enough carryout available to meet the needs for food, feed, fuel and new uses,” Hemesath added. “This contest is a way to help us think outside of the box and meet the needs of our customers, who are asking for sustainable, biobased products.” One to six winners will be selected with a total prize pool of U.S. $150,000, split equally between winners. The submission deadline is June 3, 2021, and winners will be announced in September 2021. Learn More at NCGA.com/newuses.",

    "title": "New Study Highlights the Environmental Benefits of Corn-Ethanol Showing a Reduction in Carbon Emissions by Almost 50 Percent",
    "content": "A new study released this week further emphasizes the need and benefits of corn ethanol in the nation's fuel supply. Scientists from Harvard University, Tufts University and Environmental Health & Engineering Inc., in Carbon Intensity of Corn Ethanol in the United States: State of the Science showed that corn ethanol reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 46 percent, compared to gasoline. “This study underscores what we have known for a long time,” says NCGA President John Linder. “Corn farmers continue to use sustainable practices to grow an affordable and abundant crop that is the solution to combating climate issues. This study is another reason why we need to continue moving to higher blends of ethanol as the baseline for the nation's fuel supply.” “Updated analysis such as this reflects changes in corn production that reduce carbon intensity and updated land use data that shows land use is a ‘minor contributor’ to ethanol’s profile,” Linder added. “Relying on updated data and the best science show ethanol is truly a low carbon fuel, with the potential to become even more low carbon, thanks to how farmers continue to improve corn production practices and increased yields that produce more corn from less land and fewer inputs.” The study “reviewed well-to-wheel greenhouse gas life cycle analyses for corn ethanol and evaluated models, input data, and results for farming, fuel production, co-product credit, land use change, transport of feedstock and fuel, tailpipe, and denaturant. Compared to earlier analyses, recent life cycle analyses for corn ethanol contain updates to modeling systems and data that reflect: (1) market-driven changes in corn production that lowered the intensity of fertilizer and fossil fuel use on farms; (2) more efficient use of natural gas and recent electric generation mix data for energy consumed at ethanol refineries, and (3) land use change analyses based on hybrid economic-biophysical models that account for land conversion, land productivity, and land intensification.” You can read the full study here.",

    "title": "Court Seeks Status Report on EPA Compliance with Order on Renewable Volumes",
    "content": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit today directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to submit a status report every 60 days “on its progress in complying with the court’s remand” stemming from the July 2017 ruling in Americans for Clean Energy v. EPA. The 2017 ruling required EPA to address its improper waiver of 500 million gallons of 2016 renewable fuel blending requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard. Today’s order from the D.C. Circuit was in response to a motion filed in December 2020 by biofuel and farm organizations, in which the groups asked the court to enforce its 2017 decision by requiring EPA to fully restore the 500 million gallons that were inappropriately waived from the 2016 RFS requirements. While the court denied the motion, the groups welcomed the court’s requirement that EPA provide status reports every 60 days on its progress in responding to the court’s decision. The coalition, which includes the Renewable Fuels Association, Growth Energy, National Biodiesel Board, American Coalition for Ethanol, National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, and National Sorghum Producers, issued the statement following the court’s announcement today: “While we are disappointed by the court’s order on our motion, we are glad to see that the court is holding EPA accountable by requiring it to submit a report every 60 days on the status of the court’s remand on the improper waiver. This time of transition provides EPA the opportunity to move boldly and address prior missteps when it comes to the need for a low-carbon future for our nation’s fuel supply; adjusting quickly for the court-ordered remand would do just that. America’s biofuel producers, rural communities and farm families look forward to working with EPA and the Biden administration to make progress on restoring integrity and growth to the RFS.” In the July 2017 ruling in the case Americans for Clean Energy et al. v. EPA et al., the court invalidated the EPA’s improper waiver of 500 million gallons in the 2016 RVO rule and ordered EPA to revisit the rule. The court held that EPA’s interpretation of the “inadequate domestic supply” waiver provision “runs contrary to how the Renewable Fuel Program is supposed to work.” To date, EPA has failed to complete any proceedings to reconsider the 2016 RVO and has not restored the 500 million lost RIN gallons.",

    "content": "Nearly 70-percent of annual corn demand is covered under the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) Market Development Action Team (MDAT) portfolio. From exports to animal agriculture to new uses of corn, the team is focused on growing and driving demand for America’s corn farmers. “This team had a lot of wins in 2020, and we will continue that momentum into our planning for 2021 and beyond,” said MDAT Chair and Iowa farmer Bob Hemesath. “I look forward to leading the team and tackling the challenge that faces us – how to grind more corn. Our team's portfolio includes initiatives like the Consider Corn Challenge, which we will be announcing details on our third open-innovation challenge soon; the Cattlemen’s Education Series, a virtual program that focuses on issues that impact cattle producers such as protein and energy supplementation; and Trade School, a joint venture with the U.S. Grains Council (USGC), in which we are able to give our members the tools they need to be able to better talk to members of Congress about the importance of trade, just to name a few.” The team’s 2021 priorities include: Increase demand for U.S. Animal Agriculture exports Support research into corn and corn co-product use within animal feed Identify new & support existing industrial uses of corn Support development of trade policy that opens markets, removes trade barriers and advances international demand for corn and corn products. “Last year, I got to see some of the upgrades to locks that were happening on the Illinois River and being able to experience first-hand the importance of the infrastructure of our inland waterways system as a tool for enabling exports and international competitiveness was eye-opening,” said Colorado farmer and MDAT Vice Chair Troy Schneider. “Exports of our animal ag products are essential for corn demand growth. The partnerships we have with organizations like the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) and the U.S.A. Poultry and Egg Export Council (USAPEEC) are important for continuing to grow demand not just now, but in the future.” You can learn more about some of the recent successes and work being done in the Market Development Action Team at ncga.com and look under the Key Issues tab for animal agriculture, new uses, and trade.",

    "content": "Combating the myths that exist about the use of gasoline blended with 10-percent ethanol has been the primary goal of the partnership between Crappie Masters, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA). The Crappie Masters National Tournament Trail kicked-off over the weekend with a two-day national qualifier at St. Johns River in Deland, Fla., where Robert and Tommy Sellers took home top honors and once again the winners powered their way to victory with E10 fuel. NCGA and RFA are co-title sponsors for the fifth year in a row. “We are looking forward to another great season being teamed up with the National Corn Growers Association and Renewable Fuels Association coming off our sixth straight year of all winners of the national tournament trail using E10 fuel in their boat,” said Crappie Masters President Mike Vallentine. “The anglers have been receptive to learning about ethanol fuel and now have full confidence after seeing nothing but positive engine performance results.” Last year, Crappie Masters expanded their reach by starting state chapters. This structure has been expanded again this year, bringing the total number of state chapters to 16. Because of this, memberships in Crappie Masters tripled, the average age of anglers was reduced, and their social media presence was greatly expanded. The state chapters are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, north Louisiana, south Louisiana, east Mississippi, west Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, middle Tennessee, and west Tennessee. “The expansion of Crappie Masters gives us an opportunity to reach more anglers and talk about the many benefits of corn-ethanol,” said NCGA Ethanol Action Team Chair and Iowa farmer Mark Recker. “Ethanol is an environmentally friendly fuel additive that reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent, keeping the waterways anglers’ fish clean.” “We are excited to get back to educating boaters and anglers on the benefits of using ethanol with the new season and new state chapters,” said RFA Vice President for Industry Relations Robert White. “Winning teams have shown over the years that choosing to use a domestic, renewable, cleaner-burning fuel that helps keep our air and waterways clean is easy, and it can help bring home the trophies, too.” Crappie Masters Television will also highlight each tournament. The weekly show can be found on the Pursuit Channel, which is on DIRECTV 604, Dish Network 393, Verizon, CenturyLink and Roku. The next Crappie Masters National Tournament Trail event is Feb. 26-27 at Lake D’Arbonne in Farmerville, La. The 2021 Crappie Masters Tournament Trail season runs through Sept. 25. A full schedule and additional information on the state chapters is available here.",

    "content": "Leaders of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) today congratulated President Biden on his inauguration as the 46th President of the United States. NCGA President John Linder, along with 21 state corn grower association presidents, sent a letter to Biden outlining the opportunities for corn growers and agriculture over the next four years. “As you know, farmers are optimistic by nature. Each year we plant seeds in the ground, rely on a combination of mother nature and innovation, and we are hopeful that those seeds will generate a profitable commodity. In that same regard, we are optimistic about the opportunity for farmers to play an innovative role in combating climate change and expanding our overseas markets,” the corn grower leaders wrote. NCGA and corn growers across the country are looking forward to being a part of efforts to address climate change, one of the Biden-Harris Administration’s top policy priorities. In their letter, the corn grower leaders highlighted the unique role corn ethanol can play in these efforts. “Higher-octane fuels, most effectively achieved by blending more low carbon ethanol, would unlock increased gains in vehicle efficiency, equating to more miles per gallon, and an even further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. We look forward to working closely with your Administration and Congress to begin the transition of the nation’s fuel supply to a higher-octane, low carbon fuel,” they wrote. Expanding overseas markets for U.S. corn and corn products is also a top priority for NCGA. The grower leaders expressed optimism that the new Administration will be able to forge new trade agreements with strategic partners abroad. “We are confident your vast experience in the foreign policy arena will serve the United States well in our ability to expand upon our global competitiveness,” they wrote.

There is no reason for the EPA to take this action now, especially with the Supreme Court set to consider the Tenth Circuit ruling in the new term. Corn farmers need an EPA that will follow the law as written and intended by Congress. NCGA looks forward to working with the Biden Administration to rectify the harm caused by this EPA’s abuse of small refinery exemptions and restore the integrity of the Renewable Fuel Standard.” Today’s waivers roughly account for 260 million ethanol equivalent gallons. NCGA last week, along with bipartisan lawmakers in both the House and Senate urged the Trump Administration against taking this action.",

    "content": "Agriculture has become an expert at collecting data but continues to fall short of the economic and environmental promise the information bonanza represents. The Sustainability Ag Research Action Team (SARAT) of the National Corn Growers Association has made integrating and managing the wealth of information coming from the farm a priority for 2021. “Farmers have a ton of data on everything from fertilizer performance to machinery efficiency, but it remains difficult to link it all together in a way that makes sense,” said Randy DeSutter, SARAT chairman. “If farmers can integrate it all together on their own farm, so it aids decision-making, then the potential can be realized to become more efficient and more profitable.” DeSutter is confident information management will only become more powerful in managing machinery, hybrid selection, input timing and overall farm management. However, integrating data from outside the farm is also critical such as in the research field. He cites the volume of information from phenotyping research as a good example. Determining plant traits and analyzing them creates a lot of data, he said, but the process of collecting, disseminating, and getting it to growers in a useful format will require some standardization. SARAT will also be launching a Research Ambassadors Program in 2021 geared toward linking researchers directly with farmers. The goal is to establish a network of farmers and researchers with a strong appreciation for challenges on the farm and the kind of research solutions that are necessary. After the Nourish the Future program’s success in 2020, NCGA will be expanding the initiative with the help of farmerfunded state corn checkoff programs across the U.S. The program provides excellent teaching resources that have become even more important as teachers tackle online education. The mission is to teach the ag-based curriculum in the science classroom, inspire students to solve real-world science issues, and inspiring students to fill the job gap in agriculture-related careers, many of which go unfilled.",

    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today issued proposed regulatory changes related to required pump labeling and infrastructure compatibility for E15. This is a long-awaited proposal and gives stakeholders, including NCGA, the opportunity to provide comments that will be considered by the incoming Biden Administration to complete this rulemaking process to address retail barriers. The agency today also issued a request for comments on Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) waiver requests made by oil state Governors and refiners in 2020. “Today’s announcement is a positive step forward for corn growers,” said NCGA Public Policy Director, Renewable Fuels, Kathy Bergren. “NCGA looks forward to working with the incoming Biden Administration to restore RFS integrity and stop RFS waiver abuse. We also stand ready to work with them on a final rule that supports greater E15 distribution and sales by addressing labeling and infrastructure barriers.” EPA’s announcements today did not include the granting of any further small refinery exemptions (SREs). House and Senate lawmakers on both sides of the aisle this week urged the agency not to take that step, which would undermine the RFS. Lawmakers also outlined ethanol policy priorities for the incoming Biden Administration, shared by NCGA. Also this week NCGA joined farm and biofuel leaders in condemning reports of any pending SREs. “NCGA thanks lawmakers for their support for corn farmers and ethanol. As the new Congress gets underway, we look forward to continuing to work with them to uphold the RFS and ensure a strong role for ethanol, including higher blends, as an integral part of the solution for reducing emissions,” Bergren added. The EPA also proposed extension of the RFS compliance deadlines for refiners and issued a final determination of the RFS anti-backsliding study. The review, required by the RFS, concludes that the RFS is not negatively impacting air quality. As NCGA outlined in comments to EPA earlier this year, the RFS provides significant air quality benefits.",

He’s worked tirelessly for America’s corn farmers for more than 30 years, helping tell the story of production, sustainability, ethanol and more. Mark’s contributions to the industry won’t be forgotten after he retires on January 15, 2021. “It has been a pleasure working with Mark for so long. We are going to miss his knowledge, his passion for our industry, his relationships with the media and his infectious laugh,” said NCGA CEO Jon Doggett. “Mark is never afraid to share his opinion and truly has been a fighting force when it comes to standing up for and fighting for our members.” The brains behind one of the most recognizable DC ag-consumer campaigns, Mark’s work on the Corn Farmers Coalition helped bring the farmer's voice to the forefront to educate policymakers in Washington about how innovative corn farmers are. The campaign reached millions of people every year and won multiple National Agri-Marketing Association (NAMA) awards. “I have had the pleasure of working with Mark my entire career,” said Rodney Weinzierl, Executive Director of Illinois Corn. “In that time, Mark remained fiercely loyal to corn farmers in Illinois and across our nation, constantly pursuing opportunities to improve the lives and livelihoods of corn farmers and their families. Best of all, Mark had a great time while doing it and brought us along for the fun. Congratulations to Mark on his exemplary career!” While at NCGA, Mark has built strong relationships with farm broadcasters and non-trade reporters, growing our reach year-over-year. He was instrumental in coordinating the American Ethanol NASCAR campaign NCGA was involved in and helped shape the way we communicate and promote sustainability. Mark started his career as a reporter for Illinois AgriNews and a business reporter for the Peoria Journal Star. From there, Mark went to the Illinois Corn Growers Association and Illinois Corn Marketing Board as the Communications Director for 21 years, before coming to NCGA, where he was a Senior Communications Manager and most recently Communications Director. Outside of work, Mark enjoys spending time with his wife, Nancy, son Drew, daughter Kenzie, son-in-law Jake and granddaughter Rylan. Mark loves his blues music, and you can often find him in the Soulard neighborhood of St. Louis, supporting his son-in-law’s band. He also loves photography and painting.",

    "content": "According to Illinois farmer Kate Danner, developing strong relationships with the new leadership at the Environmental Protection Agency will be an important goal for the Production Technology Access Action Team (PTAAT) of the National Corn Growers Association in 2021. Danner, 2021 chairperson of PTAAT, says, “modern farming is a complicated, sophisticated and constantly changing profession. So, we will take a proactive approach to work on farmers' behalf, defending technology tools but also promoting steps that can be taken to improve the public dialogue.” Making sure farmers have access to crop protection products that have proven to be safe and effective is critical to economic viability. In many cases, these products allow growers to use farm management practices that are better for the environment. Danner says PTAAT can play a key role in developing strong relationships with EPA and making sure farmers' voices get heard. “A lot of the work we do revolves around reviews and relicensing of technology. It often involves formal comments to agencies like EPA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. NCGA coordinates that but also makes sure farmers have an opportunity to tell their story and stand up and be counted when it matters,” said Patty Mann, vice-chairperson of PTAAT and an Ohio farmer. “There will be opportunities for our team in the year ahead to make a difference for farmers.” Raising awareness of the importance of protecting and supporting pollinators like honeybees and monarch butterflies will continue to be a front-burner issue for Corn Growers as well. NCGA is an active participant in several industry groups working on collaborative solutions for pollinator health on or near agricultural lands. The organization works with farmers to facilitate developments or expansion of pollinator habitat. Although the monarch was not placed on the endangered species list late last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will continue to review annually its potential status as threatened or endangered and may decide to list it in the future.",

    "title": "Farm & Biofuel Coalition Rejects EPAs Excuses for Failing to Comply with 2017 Court Order",
    "content": "Today, a coalition of the nation’s largest biofuels and agricultural trade groups filed its reply in support of its motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. The motion, originally filed on November 23, 2020, asks the court to enforce its 2017 decision requiring the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to address its improper waiver of 500 million gallons of biofuel demand in the 2016 renewable volume obligation (RVO). The coalition, which includes Growth Energy, Renewable Fuels Association, National Biodiesel Board, American Coalition for Ethanol, National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, and National Sorghum Producers issued a statement following the filing: “EPA should not be allowed to hide behind claims that restoring 500 million improperly waived gallons is an administrative burden that would inconvenience oil industry interests. What’s at stake is the proper implementation of the RFS and the rural communities that rely on its success for their livelihood. As we have made clear, EPA has had the ability and the authority to do the right thing and remedy these lost gallons immediately and on a definite schedule. EPA’s delay and disregard for the court’s directive for more than three years is inexcusable.” In the July 2017 ruling of the case Americans for Clean Energy et al. v. EPA et al., the court invalidated the EPA’s improper waiver of 500 million gallons in the 2016 RVO and ordered EPA to revisit the rule. The court held that EPA’s interpretation of the “inadequate domestic supply” waiver provision “runs contrary to how the Renewable Fuel Program is supposed to work.” To date, EPA has failed to open any proceedings to reconsider the 2016 RVO and has not restored the 500 million lost RIN gallons. In the reply brief filed today, the coalition reasserts that EPA’s delays in remedying the improper waiver are unreasonable and confirms that the court has the authority to require EPA to issue a 500 million gallon “curative obligation” to make up lost gallons, and to do it now.",

    "title": "NCGA to Rollout Several Major Sustainability Initiatives in 2021",
    "content": "Showcasing farmers growing commitment to sustainability will be a major goal for the National Corn Growers Association in 2021. Several major initiatives by NCGA, as well as collaborative efforts with partners, will bear fruit in the new year. “NCGA made a pioneering leap into the sustainability arena with the launch of the Soil Health Partnership. Since then, we have not let up. We have been working to take the next big steps showcasing our dedication to continuous improvement,” said Andy Jobman, Chair of NCGA’s Stewardship Action Team STAT. “Last year’s release of our U.S. Corn Commitment Statement opened the door for a very active 2021, starting with our upcoming Corn Sustainability Report and Environmental Sustainability Goals.” The report will quantify accomplishments to date on the environment and climate change and chart a course that will create a more environmentally and economically sustainable world for future generations. NCGA is working with the University of Illinois on a trendline analysis that will provide crucial information on environmental sustainability goals, Jobman notes. It focuses on the current status of the corn industry in the sustainability space. It will offer an important perspective on where corn farmers, industry stakeholders, and consumers are positioned on sustainability. The analysis will potentially target an assessment of greenhouse gas, soil loss/soil health initiatives, land use and energy use. Climate change will also be front and center in 2021. The profile and importance of addressing climate change continue to grow exponentially. NCGA’s mission is to assure the best available information and sources are used in decision making. A key priority will be positioning corn farmers as a significant solution to reducing greenhouse gas. NCGA will also continue its efforts to be a key player in the development and assessment of Carbon Markets. The organization is working to making it easier for producers to participate in climate-smart practices, navigate carbon markets, and earn extra income through carbon sequestration.",

    "title": "Risk Management and Transportation Action Team Focusing in 2021 on Infrastructure Improvements and Strong Risk Management Tools",
    "content": "NCGA’s Risk Management and Transportation Action Team (RMTAT) oversees much of NCGA’s public policy work on issues including the farm bill’s commodity, crop insurance and disaster programs; commodity markets; and transportation and infrastructure. RMTAT plays a key role in the development of NCGA policy and is looking to have an impactful 2021 and beyond. The team has a full plate of issues to consider for the coming year. U.S. infrastructure improvements, including waterways and rail systems, to keep a competitive edge for American agriculture, along with implementation of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), will be a focus for the team. RMTAT will also look ahead to the next farm bill reauthorization, evaluating current farm bill programs, looking for areas of improvement to existing programs, and continuing to support strong risk management tools essential to corn growers. Federal responses to weather-related disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic will also be on the team’s agenda for the year. With a new Administration and a new Congress convening this month, RMTAT will be working to deepen existing relationships with policy makers on both sides of the aisle and building ties with new leaders in Congress and at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). RMTAT consists of 13 NCGA grower leaders, including a liaison from the NCGA Board of Directors; 2 state staff; and 3 NCGA staff members. The 2021 RMTAT Chairman is South Dakota farmer Doug Noem. “One farmer doesn’t have a lot of clout on their own but when we all work together, we have a powerful voice. NCGA and the organization’s Action Teams are a great example of what grassroots organizations can accomplish,” said Noem. The 2021 RMTAT team will hold its first meeting next week. NCGA’s January 2021 Action Team meetings, held virtually this year, kick off next week with members of NCGA’s seven Action Teams meeting to set the organization’s priorities for the year. *This story is one in a series of stories this month where NCGA will be highlighting the work of each Action Team and outlining the priorities for each team in 2021.

    "title": "EP. 14 - New Year, New Challenges: What's On Tap for 2021, with NCGA President John Linder",
    "content": "After a 2020 calendar year in which it seems like we were always asking, \"What next?\", we take a look at what the future holds for America's corn industry with the President of the NCGA, John Linder, in the latest episode of Wherever Jon May Roam. Linder is a fifth-generation farmer from the little town of Edison, Ohio. Prior to his elevation to the role of President, John served as the Corn Board liaison to the Market Access Action Team, on the Resolutions Committee and chaired the Finance and Engaging Members Committees. He also represented NCGA at the National Coalition for Food and Agriculture Research and the National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center. Together with association CEO Jon Doggett, they'll discuss new demand generation opportunities, why it's important to get new growers involved with the NCGA, and what Commodity Classic is going to look like in a pandemic year. DIRECT SHARE TRANSCRIPTS John Linder: This is where we're heading this year with the board is to look at, okay, if we get demand back, is it sustainable? What's missing? Who's not at the table? Because that's how we bring market value to our growers. Dusty Weis: Hello, and welcome to Wherever Jon May Roam, the National Corn Growers Association podcast. This is where leaders, growers, and stakeholders in the corn industry can turn for big picture conversations about the state of the industry and its future. I'm Dusty Weis, and I'll be introducing your host, association CEO, Jon Doggett. You can join Jon every month as he travels the country on a mission to advocate for America's corn farmers. From the fields of the Corn Belt to the DC Beltway, we'll make sure that the growers who feed America have a say in the issues that are important to them with key leaders who are shaping the future of agriculture. Dusty Weis: In this episode, after a year in which it seems like we were always asking, \"What next?\" we take a look ahead to 2021 and answer some of those questions about what's next for America's corn industry. From new demand generation to opportunities to get involved with advancing the industry to what Commodity Classic is going to look like in a pandemic year, we'll take a look at the future with NCGA's president, Ohio corn farmer, John Linder. If you haven't yet, make sure you're subscribed to this podcast in your favorite app. That way, you can take us with you in your truck, your tractor, or on your next trip, and never miss an update from Jon. Also, make sure to follow the NCGA on Twitter @NationalCorn, and sign up for the National Corn Growers Association newsletter at NCGA.com. Dusty Weis: And with that, it's time to once again introduce Jon. Jon Doggett, the CEO of the National Corn Growers Association. Jon, the old saying goes that hindsight is 2020, and so appropriately enough, 2020 is the year that gave us a whole lot of hindsight. Certainly nothing changes overnight as we turn the page on the calendar from 2020 to 2021. But this does raise a great opportunity to have a forward-looking conversation with NCGA’s President, John Linder. Jon Doggett: That's right, Dusty. And certainly he's well-known in the world of agriculture, particularly in the world of corn, but I'm going to introduce him anyway. John Linder is a fifth generation farmer from the little town of Edison, Ohio, which is just a ways away from Columbus, Ohio. Prior to serving as our president, John served as the corn board liaison to the market access action team. He served on the resolutions committee and chaired the engaging members committee, and very importantly, at one point, he chaired the finance committee. He's represented NCGA at the National Coalition for Food and Ag Research and the National Corn to Ethanol Research Center. John, thanks again for all of the service that you have done for our industry, and thanks for making the commitment to serve this next year. We appreciate it, and thanks, of course, for joining us on Wherever Jon May Roam. John Linder: Well, it's good to be here, Jon. Thank you for the introduction. I'll go a little further with it. You know now I'm John Linder, the current president of the National Corn Growers Association. Yeah, a farmer from Ohio. We are about an hour north of Columbus, and it's more central to the middle of the state than actually Columbus is, so if you're ever looking at a map and throw a dart in the middle, you probably hit one of our farms. And I farm with my brother, Mike. Have since I was a kid. John Linder: I did leave the farm and take an opportunity for a little further education, and I went to a tech school to be a mechanic. So post-high school, my only training as a mechanic, so I did find that it was really a good opportunity to learn about myself and what I wanted to do, and I went off the farm and actually worked at a John Deere dealership for a while, worked on tractors and combines. And it was a good experience, and come back to the farm at the worst time ever, the 1980s. Bought a farm. About killed the whole dynamic that my dad and brother had put together. We survived together, and working together is really how things get done in agriculture. I've learned that firsthand from the school of hard knocks, in learning economics of agriculture. John Linder: The family dynamic, it was dad and mom were so integral to the farm. Our brother, Mike, got into it first. I come along in 1980. Just before I bought the farm, my wife and I got married. Cheryl, Mike, and I are now the principals in the farm. We have kids on the farm. They help out all they can. One of our daughters, Katie, works for us, and she also works off the farm as a contractor. Oldest daughter actually works for Bunge in a kind of unique situation in a farmers co-op office. And so all very close to the farm, live very central. Nobody's more than five miles from the farm, so it really works out well for us to have that additional help. John Linder: And my son-in-law, Mike, works in our other company. We do sell propane, and we just look for diversity in our operation, and we decided that propane might be a good fit, so my son-in-law, Mike, runs that operation. And Katie just married again, and her husband works at Ohio State University, and he came and helped run combine this fall, so it is a family operation, but we do have additional help on the farm. John Linder: Something else that you may not know about me, my brother Mike and I, since probably about that same time I got married, 1980, have pulled a tractor. It's been virtually the same tractor since then. It's a pro stock. It's a John Deere. It is a diesel. It has a single turbocharger limitation, and we've had a lot of fun, lot of success, some real disappointments, but after pulling for, oh gosh, now it looks like close to 40 years, right? We've had six grand national titles. John Linder: We've got three of something that many pullers strive to achieve and have yet to achieve. We've got three Bowling Green rings. They're like a Super Bowl ring. It's the largest outdoor event in the summertime. We're very fortunate to have had that opportunity, but the National Farm Machinery in Louisville is another place we've had a lot of success. And so people do recognize us as the Linder brothers. Mike does most of the driving, so a lot of folks don't even know I exist in tractor pulling, but it's been a fun hobby and a good one. My brother Mike is single, and if he didn't do that, I don't know what other hobby he would do. But grandchildren, gosh. That's more special. If you were going to know me about, for any particular reason, if you wanted to know me, I'd want you to know me about my grandchildren. That is the best thing that I've ever done, that I didn't have anything to do with. Jon Doggett: Amen to that. Amen to that brother. Dusty Weis: How many grandchildren, John? John Linder: We have two so far. I've got a 13-year-old grandson and an 11-year-old granddaughter. They're playing basketball. I have to brag. Ashton is a go-getter. She is really competitive. Kayden loves to compete, but it's more about a little bit of a social exercise for him. It's not super social, but he really likes that part of it. Ashton is really competitive. They won a game a couple of weeks ago. Gosh, more than a couple. Gosh, it's back in December, right? I'm losing track of time already. And they won. Their score was 19. I don't know what the opponents were, but she scored 17 of the 19, and several were foul shots because they recognized what they were up against. Jon Doggett: That's pretty great. And I've met your grandchildren. It's hard to believe your grandson is 13 already because gosh, when did ... We did a paddle trip on the Potomac. How many years has that been? Five years ago? Something like that. John Linder: Time flies. That was a delight and such a wonderful experience to do that with the kids. The monuments from the river are just an amazing experience. Jon Doggett: Yeah. It's always a lot of fun. John, tell us, how did you get involved with the National Corn Growers Association? John Linder: For me, it was just like probably most everybody. I got asked. I got asked if I wanted to contribute, and we always look for that next leader, and we really tried to do a good job of searching. And Anthony Bush, who's been on the national board, and he's actually the Commodity Classic chair, is the person who invited me to consider getting on the board in Ohio. And then it was Tad Nicholson that pushed me and said, \"You need to think about contributing a little more.\" And so I said, \"Well, if I'm going to do that, I'm going to take leadership.\" So I stepped up in the first year on the board and was fortunate enough to be selected for leadership at its best, and it's a natural thing. National Corn Growers has given me the opportunity for leadership, consider an action team, a little more work with National Corn Growers. John Linder: And that's where I landed with the trade policy biotech for two years. Great staff there and good leadership, and after two years on the team, I got to be the chair for two years, so trade kind of gets me excited. I'm glad we took that to the next level because it's really serving our growers well, the effort that we've put into that. And certainly want to thank our relationship with the U.S. Grains Council. Those folks have been a tremendous attribute and a great investment for our checkoff dollars as well as with us at National Corn. John Linder: But yes, what we do for trade at national is probably a little bit unsung because everybody thinks we're about just production and trying to figure out where we sell it domestically. But we play an international role as well. Got great relationship with whoever's in USTR regardless of the administration. They've always recognized the importance of having corn in the room, in the conversation, so it's really been a rewarding area to be focused in. Jon Doggett: John Linder, farmer from Ohio. Now you're president of the National Corn Growers Association. How did you get on the board? What happened to make you decide to do that? John Linder: For me, looking back, it almost makes my head spin a little bit because things can happen fast. If you really want to dig in and contribute, you can move along in this association rather quickly, and time does pass rather quickly. I have to tell you, when I became president on October 1st, I woke up that morning, and I swear, the earth was spinning a little faster. And my wife looked over at me, and she said, \"Good morning, Mr. President.\" It hit home. Now you're representing 300,000 corn farmers. John Linder: How did I get to the board? What led me to the role I'm in? I mentioned that I actually was an action team chair, which is a subcommittee of the board, doing that for two years and folks appreciate what our team did, and so you do get that recognition. It's undeniable. If your team really does a remarkable job, which that team typically with trade and biotech, both issues very dear to the corn industry, you've got recognition. So I realized that if I was ever going to run for the board, you probably ought to take that springboard of recognition, so I took that leap of faith and took the application, went through the process, and was fortunately elected to the board. It was such a surprise. John Linder: You don't think you're all that, and then you find out others believe in you, so then you take those jobs seriously. For me, it's always been one job at a time. You may have several different things that you're tasked with, but you really want to do what's in front of you really well. So when I got on the board, I had those opportunities to focus on particular areas of interest and it's so rewarding. And evidently, the board felt the same way. As finance chair, they felt like there was a great appreciation for the effort that I put into it. John Linder: And I thought, there you go again. Timing may be just right because the officer rotation is a three-year commitment. It's a large commitment. And the time that it takes to be an officer, and every role that I've ever taken at NCGA, I've always given it a fair amount of time at home and let it run it up the family flagpole, make sure that everybody else is on board because who's filling the gap while I'm not home? It's my brother, my wife, my kids, my employees. So you have those conversations, and timing was right, so I asked the board if they would consider me, and they did. Jon Doggett: John, you've gone through so many chairs and so many positions at NCGA, and like you said, you woke up October 1st, and you're the president. And it's the middle of a pandemic, and there's a lot of stuff going on. So not only was the world moving faster, but you had a big, big role to play for an awful lot of people. What did you do that first week and second week and third week? How did you approach the pandemic, and how did you lead this organization through some of that? John Linder: When you take over the office and you're under a pandemic, it's a level of commitment you find yourself not wanting to turn it off, so you do have to find that space where you can recharge and refresh. But one of the spaces that I've found that had been particularly rewarding in managing issues is actually consulting with my wife, consulting with my fellow board members, talking to my brother and getting his perspective, because it may be a little more focused to the farm than I have landed because now I'm in a world that he is not. That grounding is really important, but Kevin Ross later wrote forward for us in leadership. I told Kevin, I said, you get the momentum going, and I'll do my best to keep it moving for us. Having Kevin there still is a critical role. John Linder: I make no bones about it. Chris Edgington, the vice president of the National Corn Growers, is a good friend, and so it's really rewarding to have those relationships and being able to manage things that we're looking at. The pandemic, we've had some really good successes even through the pandemic because what we do at National Corn doesn't turn on and off. It's an every day effort. John Linder: Our staff live, eat, and breathe this on our behalf. We may go back and shell corn, or we may go back and plant corn. We have really good people behind us doing this work every day for which we've given direction and guidance to how to be effective and give them our perspectives, which are difficult, like I said. It's my grounding with my brother to make sure I've not forgot the farm focus. They're grounding for what's the focus in agriculture as their board. I feel we do that really well, so there's been such a background effort of good things that keep happening. And there's a lot of good things that happen that we don't even maybe get to communicate out the small ones, but they add up to really big ones. Dusty Weis: Jon Doggett, CEO of the National Corn Growers Association, I've got to ask you, too. When you look back at the year that was in 2020, how are you going to remember it? And what do you think the lasting legacy is for America's corn industry? Jon Doggett: When I look back on 2020, it's not what I remember. It's what I'd like to forget, and that's a lot of it. What I really found to be heartening throughout the whole year, and it was a long, long year, was that staff worked really hard. Growers worked really hard. We worked well together, and we came to understand that we were going to have to do things like Zoom meetings. And at first, that was tough, and it's still not easy, but I think everybody stepped up, and we realized we had to do two things. Jon Doggett: One, we had to continue our longer term demand and organizational issues that we always have done, and then we had the shorter term. How are we going to deal with this pandemic? What do we have to do first to help our growers stay safe? We've talked a lot about mental health issues. There's a lot of stress out in farm country, so we did that. We also put together a short-term market recovery effort, and I'd like John to talk about that in a second, but I'm just struck that people have pushed on and pushed on. Jon Doggett: And that one of President Linder's favorite expressions, and it's the code by which he lives, and that is, \"Leave no stone unturned.\" And I certainly believe that no stone, no rock, no pebble was unturned by this organization under leadership of John Linder, and it's just been great. We've had a lot of great presidents, and John's one on that list, and it's been good. But I'd like John to talk about our market recovery plan and how that unfolded and what your observations were about that. And more importantly, what do corn farmers who are listening to this podcast, what do they need to hear about that effort? John Linder: You know what? A pandemic throws you a curve ball, you've got no choice but to swing. And sometimes, you don't have quite the control on where that ball lands, but you really take a concerted effort to look out and see and get a feeling for what's going on. And so we set up a COVID task force immediately, and we brought in folks from state staff, grower leaders from the board, from the management team, and we started having discussions of what's going on around the country. And very quickly, we all realized we had some real struggles. One was the ethanol. People had to quit driving, and so we quit moving liquid fuel. We also had the issue with the livestock industry, keeping workers safe and being able to process meat protein. Right? John Linder: And so then you look at this, and you say, Okay, what can we do to make a difference?\" And so we decided that there was probably a real opportunity to reach out to our value chain, those in the livestock, those in the ethanol, those that purchased corn and used corn anywhere and bring those folks in. And that's what that market recovery plan was about. We hired a consultant, Aimpoint Research, and they took us through that step-by-step to how to tie the concerns throughout our value chain, throughout our industry. We all lobbied for the farmers to be determined to be essential and didn't find supply disruptions, so planting went on barring mother nature issues, right? And the other parts of our value chain, you couldn't say the same. It was such a struggle and still is today, so that's what the market recovery plan is about. And it's going to have a long-term outcome, but we're looking for those points for which we can make little differences in each of the industries and altogether as one as well, so that we do have solid markets moving forward. John Linder: It's one thing to have demand and have it disappear, but it's another thing to put a real consideration into, and this is where I take the board. This is where we're heading this year with the board is to look at, okay, if we get demand back, is it sustainable? We need to prop our demand up and make sure what's missing? Who's not at the table? What parts are we not coupling to our demand to make sure that it is sustainable? Because that's how we bring market value to our growers. It has to be the mindset that the farmer needs sustainability. He needs to be able to face every day with some type of consistency and assurance that there is a reason he does what he does, and that value is what we're attempting to bring. Jon Doggett: John Linder, as we're getting into 2021 here, what are your organizational goals for the year? NCGA is a rather large entity. It has a fairly good size budget, 55, 60 employees. There's a lot of moving parts. What are your goals for all of that for this next year? John Linder: Taking the board to the next level is really one of my main goals. We really demand, right? You're always going to say demand regardless, but how you achieve that and how you make it sustainable. I think you've got really strong leadership on the board, and I want to capitalize on that. And so we've undergone a process for which we make sure that no one gets entrenched in a particular topic. We make sure that everybody gets out of their silo, gets out of their comfort zone, and is looking very much at a big picture. And that's one of my goals is to make sure that the board is really solid, and we'll use them to the best of our ability. John Linder: One of my goals is I will do everything in my power to help this industry recover and grow. Well, that's a little bit about refinement, and we do a lot of things really well, but if we need to take on something different, a little bit tangential, out of our market recovery plan, we need to make sure that our priorities are set right. And we reached out to our state leaders, asked them to go through the priorities and policy session to tell us what's really top of mind and how do we focus to serve those out in the countryside best in that regard. John Linder: And that's an annual process, but it's really critical this year. And the board took that to heart. They were part of that conversation and heard every word of it, so they know where to go. But the bigger conversations we're going to have in the boardroom and utilize our staff to their full potential. Always, there is more potential in every individual that we have, and we can bring with us than we ever get to realize, so how do we maximize that? How do we figure out who's not in the room, and how do we get them there? That's a really critical conversation, as well. You can't know what you don't know if you don't reach out and ask those that actually do know. So we have to have those conversations, so we can figure out, \"I didn't know that.\" That's impactful. How do we get there? Dusty Weis: And certainly, the next John Linder might be out there somewhere, just waiting for somebody to reach out to them and invite them to the table to join in on the conversation, too. And so I think that finding ways to build on that outreach are certainly important. Jon Doggett, as we've watched over the past month here as the new presidential administration has been shaping up, certainly, that's your forte there is what's going on in Washington? What do you think about how this new administration is shaping up and what it means for agriculture? Jon Doggett: I started my career in Washington when Ronald Reagan was president, and Dusty, that was the president many, many years ago. You were probably in grade school. But it has been absolutely amazing. I have seen a number of transitions over the years. I have never seen an incoming administration be so forthcoming and reach out. We've had more contacts with the transition team from the Biden folks than I've seen from all of the rest of them put together several times. We got an outreach from the transition team and Robert Bonnie and Jonathan Coppess, and they reached out to us, and I thought, \"Well, that was nice of them, that they called.\" Jon Doggett: And then they called again, and then they set up another call, and then they set up another call. I got a call right before Christmas one evening from Michael Regan, who Joe Biden has named to be his EPA administrator. We've never had this kind of thing before, and it's really very encouraging. The proof is going to be in the pudding, got a lot of detail, but the initial opportunities we've had to talk to these folks has been truly remarkable, and we're going to have to build on that. And it's going to take a lot of hard work on our part in order to do that. Dusty Weis: And of course the person who's going to lead the charge on that is Mr. John Linder, the new president of the Corn Growers Association. John, what are your expectations for working with the new administration and then also your expectations for the new Congress? Because it's a three branch government. Congress has a big role to play in this, too. John Linder: I think Jon Doggett said it really well. This is a critical time, but this administration is different than the past, and the past on's different than the one before that. And so we have a history of this kind of change, but we've had such a good relationship working bipartisanly at National Corn Growers. There's an opportunity here because the faces are, as Jon said, being appointed, being seated, are familiar faces. Not only do we know them, they know us. John Linder: That's such an opportunity when folks know you and know your issues a little bit, and you can just go in and refine it. I want to tell every one of them, every policy decision we're going to make at the National Corn Growers is going to be based on its ability to [inaudible 00:23:49] corn and provide for a sustainable future. That's something that's not really new. It's just a little bit refined, a little bit different. I want to have the conversation around the Future Fuels Guide, and folks who already have a little background that it's there. I've met with a few virtually and kind of surprised me how many actually knew it was out there. So as we build momentum in this Congress, the opportunity is there because they know us, and we have a good working relationship. Dusty Weis: John Doggett, this is an area where you may have been ahead of the curve in a lot of ways. From very early on in your tenure with the National Corn Growers Association, and then early on in the podcast, you've sort of been beating the drum for a little more bipartisanship, a little more cooperation. In fact, we went to Washington before the pandemic started and sat down with one Democrat and one Republican and talked about the need just for that. But voices like that have started to get a little bit louder in Washington over the past year. Do you think that the 117th Congress is the opportunity to finally start building some more bridges instead of burning them down? Jon Doggett: Absolutely, and our work with the No Labels Caucus in the House of Representatives, a group of about 50 members equally split between Republicans and Democrats, that's been great work, and it's really given us an opportunity to see folks at their best, see folks where they're trying to find solutions to the problems that face our nation. We also see a bit of that going on in the Senate, and as last year when the Senate was pulling together the stimulus package or the package to deal with COVID and everything else, we saw the emergence of probably a dozen or so senators equally split between Republicans and Democrats. You have Mark Kelly from Arizona and Susan Collins from Maine. There are some moderates in the Senate, more so than perhaps in the House. They will have an influence that far exceeds what you would think because of their numbers. Jon Doggett: I think the same will happen in the House. If we can find a place where there's a cadre of folks in the middle, trying to solve problems rather than beat up the person across the aisle, I think that's not only good for the corn industry. That's good for the United States of America. And I sense that there is a real desire on the part of some, not all, unfortunately, but some members of Congress to actually sit down and listen a little bit and shout a little bit less. And that is something we have to encourage those folks to do. And as I remind folks when they complain about what's going on in Washington, those folks that serve in the Congress were not born and raised in the District of Columbia. They were sent there by the voters of the United States of America, so not only did we send them here, we also need to hold them accountable for some things, and I think this is going to be the year, hopefully, that that will happen. Jon Doggett: Joe Biden is a centrist. He always was in the middle, the exact middle of the Democratic caucus, no matter which Congress it was for all of those years. He's brought a lot of people who'd understand government very well and who are technocrats. They're not ideologues. Take a look at Katherine Tai, who is named as the U.S. Trade Rep, a long-time Hill staffer who really understands trade. I'd think what a lot of people don't know about her is that she was the one that wrote a lot of the language and did a lot of the negotiations for the implementing language for USMCA, and had she not done it the way she did and her hard work, we might not have had USMCA pass in the House of Representatives. But that's not something a lot of people see. Jon Doggett: But if she goes over to USTR, she's going to carry a lot of that with her, carry over a lot of things about China, so I think we have some opportunities here. But again, we have to find these solutions in the middle because they don't exist on the far ends of either spectrum. Jon Doggett: John Linder, as we get into the early months of the year, we start thinking about Commodity Classic, and we're going to be thinking about and doing Commodity Classic much differently this year. What are your observations about what we're doing, what we're going to do, how it's going to work, and what folks might expect from Commodity Classic for this year? John Linder: I think they're going to demonstrate what some of my goals are for NCGA, to come out of the pandemic stronger on the other side, what the opportunities become. It seems like a hurdle to learn how to work virtually and become one and the same with Zoom is a little awkward. I've got some advantage here. The current co-chair of the Commodity Classic lives a mile and a half from me, so I can go put on a mask and have a good heart-to-heart conversation about where we're going with Commodity Classic. And we're landing very good, and I think folks ought to be excited. It's coming up really quick to be able to register, and we're going to have a little more meeting space. The learning sessions should be more robust. John Linder: One of the things we ought to be encouraged about is we might find that we're going to tap an international audience because they're having the same issues. They can't meet face-to-face and go to shows, so if we strive to be best in class, and that's what we try to do in everything we do, it should be a platform that really kind of excites outside audiences that have, to participate and show up and look out when we do have our next get-together. John Linder: It would be just wonderful to ... We're limited on where we go when we're doing it in person because of the size of the venue, has to be able to manage the crowd that we can draw. And we set a record last year. I wonder what we're going to do when we come out of this on the other side in 2022. It could be phenomenal, and you could see an international audience there. It's an opportunity. I would look at it as none other than an opportunity if I'm a grower that just wanted to attend or a corn leader that's participating in anything surrounding it. It is an opportunity. We're going to do it right. Jon Doggett: John Linder, farmer from Ohio, you have talked a lot about opportunities on this podcast, and you talk about them a lot. You want to get people out of their comfort zone. I have heard you say that many, many times. What gets you out of your comfort zone, and what compels you to try to get others out of their comfort zone? John Linder: Comfort zone's an interesting conversation, and it was a conversation with my father. I lost dad in 2005. Miss him greatly. There are just so many jobs that he wanted to do all the way to the end, and he did them so well. We really were very fortunate, but early on, out of school, I had an idea we could do something different. And I said to my dad, I said, \"Well, why don't we try this?\" Well, this is the heat of the battle. He just wanted to get out. He said, \"Go do what I said and get going.\" It was pretty emphatic. John Linder: Guess what happened a year later? Idea was what we were doing. And he had an opportunity to think about it, reflect, and I got by and just by dropping it, I really, really like when I throw an idea out there and it gains traction and gains refinement from others and they actually own it and I don't even have to do it. It's a subliminal way to delegate, and the board realizes I like to delegate. I don't have to do it all. I just make sure that we're focused and going in the right direction. Jon Doggett: John Linder, as we kind of wind down here, I'm going to ask you a question that I always hate getting from somebody in the media because this is recorded. It's going to be around for forever, so we'll be able to come back to this over and over again. So give us your predictions for 2021. John Linder: If I had a crystal ball, I know. Everything seems to be more successful in hindsight, but we lay a really good foundation to move forward and have success. And I think that with our market recovery plan, with all our efforts, our action teams are just phenomenal. I think it's an under-sung hero, the folks that come in and work so closely with us. I'd loved the opportunity to handpick teams to work for the board, and they're going to give us the information for which we need to know in order to move programs forward. One of my goals is for every one of our programs to be evaluated on its ability to grind corn and provide for a sustainable future. That comes through our grower leaders. That comes from our states. That comes from our action teams. The depth of what they're doing right now, preparing for action team meetings in January, is just phenomenal, and the outcomes that are coming out of that, it's just going to be so great. John Linder: We're going to have some really deep conversations to figure out, like I said, what's missing, who needs to be in the room, who needs to be at the table to be able to be successful for what our teams are challenging us to do. The great story for me for the future of corn growers is the people that are really working hard. What we really need to complement that is for everybody to go to NCGA.com and click on there to become either a member of the association or at least get the information flowing into the inbox so when we ge a call to action, so we can reach out to members of Congress to make a difference for you, we can take you with us. That's going to be so exciting, if you would do that. I can turn one stone over at a time, but together, we can move mountains if we just keep rolling stones over together. And move mountains of corn. That's our goal. Dusty Weis: You know, Jon Doggett, turnabout is only fair play. What are your predictions for the 2021 year ahead? Jon Doggett: I think John answered it well, and I will answer it in part this way, and that is, what will happen this year will depend on what we do. And we cannot stand back and be observers of 2021. We need to step up and fulfill our own predictions of what can happen for this year. And the more people we bring to the table, the more ideas we'll have, the more perspectives we'll have, and when we get that, then we can move forward. And as long as we are united as an organization, as an industry, we are going to move those mountains of corn that John talks about.,And we are going to continue to turn over those stones and make sure they're not unturned, and this could be a great year. Jon Doggett: I remember last year, though, I was glad to say goodbye to 2019. I really am glad to say goodbye to 2020 because we have a lot of work to do, and I'm looking forward to getting it done with great leaders that we have in this organization.

    "title": "Corn in the Biorenewable Space Featured as the Cover Story of Industrial Biotechnology",
    "content": "The use of corn as an industrial feedstock was featured as the cover story of Industrial Biotechnology, a leading industry journal focused on biobased industrial and environmental products and processes. The paper, “Industrial Biotechnology: An Industry at an Inflection Point,” illustrates the technology evolution in the biobased manufacturing infrastructure and processes. It also highlights new technologies that will continue to advance progress in this space. Leaders from across the value chain collaborated on the paper. “It’s important to continue to set the stage for future corn grind, tell corn’s story as the preferred industrial feedstock of choice, and show how we are a solution for products in the biorenewable space,” said NCGA’s Director of Market Development Sarah McKay. “The paper also reviews consumer and industry demand factors, sustainability considerations, and policy suggestions to drive the industry forward.” The paper was co-authored by Nathan Danielson—BioCognito; Paul Bloom—Archer Daniels Midland James R Randall Research Center; Jennifer Dunn—Northwestern University & Northwestern Argonne Institute of Science and Engineering; Neal Jakel—Fluid Quip Technologies; Timothy Bauer—Fluid Quip Technologies; John Hannon—Vertimass; Michael Jewett—Northwestern University; Brent Shanks—Iowa State University; & Sarah McKay—NCGA. \"This paper shows that the combination of new technologies and corn's competitiveness as a sustainable feedstock indicates a very bright future for new uses,” said paper co-author Nathan Danielson. “It was important to have so many experts come together to collaborate on this paper to show the strength of the industry,” McKay added. “We are at a pivotal point and now is the time to strike while the iron is hot and engage with and get in front of as many in the biorenewables industry as we can.” The paper abstract says, “Industrial Biotech is poised for dramatic growth. A confluence of consumer demand, attractive feedstock quantity, quality, price, and technical innovation has created a perfect situation for the industry to significantly expand. Since the 2004 Werpy and Peterson paper, “Top Value Added Chemicals from Biomass,” the biobased manufacturing industry and the technologies that make these processes and products possible has evolved significantly. New technology continues to advance and there is increasing consumer and industry demand for biobased materials. Paired with increasing on-farm efficiency and sustainability considerations, these are all factors that are driving the bioeconomy forward. This paper reviews these factors and illustrates where the technology can head, identifying opportunities for utilizing corn-based sugars as a feedstock for near-term, high-impact products in the biorenewable space. Furthermore, this paper suggests what policies should be considered to move the industry towards the future.” You can view the paper that was published in Industrial Biotechnology here.",
