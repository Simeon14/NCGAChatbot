Deb Fischer: Revving the Engine on Year-Round E15 In this episode of the Cobcast, were joined by Sen. Fischer herself to discuss the importance of E15 legislation for corn farmers and the agricultural economy. Listen Here Resources Today, nearly every gallon of gasoline in the U.S. contains a minimum of 10 ethanol derived from corn. U.S. corn farmers believe so strongly in the case for higher blends of ethanol, because of corn ethanols ability to improve engine performance and reduce environmental impacts, all at a lower cost to consumers. Corn farmers work tirelessly to ensure consumers have a future choice at the fuel pump that delivers all the benefits possible through fuels blended with higher volumes of ethanol. Whether its backing the market access provided by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) or expanding the marketplace with higher blends of ethanol, like E15, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is working for Americas corn farmers to increase ethanol use. Each year, roughly 30 of field corn goes into fuel ethanol. Ethanol is the second-largest customer for U.S. corn.

Resources U.S. Falls Behind in Trade Agreements The export of corn and corn products is vital to the nations economy, and NCGA has a deeply rooted policy of working to eliminate barriers to trade and supporting market development. Exports of U.S. corn and corn products provide critical support across the economy, offering billions in direct and indirect economic benefits to farmers, rural communities, and the nation. Unfortunately, as the graphic shows, the U.S. is the lowest on the list for number of trade agreements currently in place. The graphic demonstrates that other nations are more effectively negotiating trade deals, putting the U.S. at a disadvantage.
